Subject: [Paraview] Displaying wave elevation in time
Message-ID: <CAB8-E4B9D6EGFHDMJ_fAQu0scd8zdnLJLqpF+oMNi5zRMAFSZw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Paraview users,

I would like to display a wave elevation field in Paraview, that is a
structured mesh with a scalar data (wave elevation). This mesh moves over
time.
I came up with a solution based on CSV point files and a delaunay 2d filter
in Paraview to represent wave elevation.

I ask myself some questions about the input file format, that could contain
only points, or a mesh.
Is there a dedicated format to do so?
Ideally, this format would
- be a single file containing all results over time
- not repeat data (My CSV files contain repeatdly the same coordinates many
many times)

I have looked at VTK format, but I can't figure out which one would answer
my needs.
Can HDf5 file format help? (If it is possible to import hdf5 package in
python interpreter)

My data could be represented like this

ti, y0, y1, y2, y3
x0,z00,z01,z02,z03
x1,z10,z11,z12,z13
x2,z20,z21,z22,z23
x3,z30,z31,z32,z33
x4,z40,z41,z42,z43
x5,z50,z51,z52,z53

where ti represents a timestep

Subject: [Paraview] Toggling between 2D & 3D view Issue
Message-ID: <000a01cfc649$d58ccb00$80a66100$@net.my>

Dear friends,

 

here is my implementation for having 2D view along with 3D view:

 

$("#view_3d").bind("mousedown", function(){

                                  if ($(this).hasClass("session_started")) {

 
pv.connection.session.call('vtk:load3DView', null);

                                                return false;

       }else{

                                 $(this).addClass("session_started");

                                  create3DView("#view_3d);


 
pv.connection.session.call('vtk:save3DView', null);

                }              

 

$(UI_AXIAL).bind("mouseup", function(){

                                pv.connection.session.call('vtk:save3DView',
null);

});

 

I have the similar code for 2D. There are 2 viewports created to show loaded
volume:

 

pv.viewport_3D = vtkWeb.createViewport({

                                                                session:
pv.connection.session

                                                });

 
pv.viewport_3D.bind("#view_3d");

 

and same code for 2D.

 

By clicking on each view, RPC function 'vtk:save3DView' or 'vtk:save2DView'
will be called. Each one changes the display properties & render view for
representing appropriate view. For example for loading 3D:

 

                dp.Representation = 'Volume'

                view = simple.GetRenderView()

                view.InteractionMode = '3D'

 

I can expect that it takes time to render the scene when the user clicks on
the other view, especially changing from 2D to 3D.

But, the issue is by clicking on the other view, the last view is shown
before the completion of the rendering. For instance, if the current view is
2D, and user clicks on 3D, immediately, the last 2D scene is displayed in 3D
view for a while, before having the rendered 3D view from the server.

 

My question is how to prevent system to show the 2D view in 3D view, and
just wait for the server to send rendered 3D scene.

 

 

Best regards,

Why don't you use two truly separate view on the server side. That way you
won't have any rendering artifact. And you can easily show/hide the local
one in the web browser.
Then on the client side, you just have to worry about which one is visible.

Subject: [Paraview] Point label format in Find Data
Message-ID: <F9562F3B302F29479A203FC5AF9E3E0532C28E@SERBE4I1.intra.erbe-med.de>

Hi,

returning to ParaView after some time, I have learned that the Selection Inspector of the 3.x series is gone and has been replaced by the Find Data dialog. As before, I can display a label for each selected point showing, its ID, its temperature or whatever. It sometimes has been practical to tweak the format of those labels using C-like format strings in the "Label Format" field in the Selection Inspector.  I did not find this field in the Find Data dialog - I would expect it to be in the "Advanced selection display properties" box. Is it somewhere else, or hasn't it been implemented in the new dialog? If so, is this planned, or do I need to post a feature request?

Thanks,

Matthias

This has indeed been fixed in 4.2-RC1. The advanced properties should
now show the label format strings.

Subject: [Paraview] seg.fault when reading VRML files twice
Message-ID: <20140903.115011.281070362.furutaka.kazuyoshi@jaea.go.jp>

Dear ParaView experts...

As the subject says, I'm suffering from the segmentation faluts
when reading VRML files.

It occurs:
  (i)  File->Open a VRML file, display the content,
       (File->Disconnect) then File->Open a VRML file and display it,
 
  (ii) on linux (Fedora 20, binary package: paraview-4.1.0-1.fc20.i686)
       as well as on windows (Vista Business SP2, "4.1.0 32-bit",
       ParaView-4.1.0-Windows-32bit.exe, downloaded from
       http://www.paraview.org/download/

  (iii) regardless of whether the second VRML file is the same as
       or different from the first one,

  (iV) even with a simple VRML file as the attached one...

It DOES NOT occur when loading/displaying multiple VRML files
in the same session (w/o disconnecting)...

How can I avoid/fix this?

I'll attach a trimmed backtrace obtained on linux with gdb...

Thanks in advance.

Kazuyoshi

Subject: [Paraview] Problem with "no colormap"
Message-ID: <192168710.115876.1409721433281.open-xchange@app10.ox.hosteurope.de>

Dear all,
i'm using Paraview v4.1 on a Windows 7 PC.
When creating data with FEM Software ELMER my Paraview Installation is able to
read in and process the data (e.g. "plot over line").
But showing a "Color map" is not possible. The geometry is always displayed in
uniform blue and also rescaling (Auto and Manual) cannot make it work.
The former Version worked (v3.8). And suprisiling the Input data can be
displayed correctly (with rainbow Color map for example) on another Computer
(Win7, Paraview v4.1).

So: Did anyone had the same issue and could help me?

Thanks in advance.

Alex

Message-ID: <C8921E2F87E8024BBD6C59CB07C0F47D28D0DD22@aai-exch-mbx1.campus.unibe.ch>

Hi,

I have saved a paraview state in python format. In the pipeline there are a couple of filters coming from an xml plugin (generated in this way http://www.kitware.com/blog/home/post/534 ). When I try to run the the script in the python shell  (with the plugin already loaded from the gui menu), I get the error "'module' object has no attribute 'myfilter'" .
I have tried also the following commands:

>>LoadPlugin("path/to/myfilter.xml",globals())
>>servermanager.myfilter
But still I am not able to access it.
If it can help, when I load the pipeline from a pvsm file, the filter is correctly loaded.
If I select it and call GetActiveSource, I get: <paraview.servermanager. myfilter object at 0x0000000015B40A20>

What should be the correct command for calling it?
Thank you

I believe you should be accessing it as :
   >> myfilter()

And not servermanager.myfilter.

Never heard of this before. But try toggling the "Interpolate scalar
before mapping" checkbox on the Properties panel. Any difference?

You may also want to try the latest 4.2-RC1 binaries, just in case.

Hi,

	I?m having trouble getting the git-master version of the Superbuild running on OSX (10.9) with clang (5.1). Setting the CMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT variable causes the following error during CMake (2.8.12.2) generation for the ParaView subproject: 

-- The C compiler identification is unknown
-- The CXX compiler identification is unknown
-- Check for working C compiler using: Ninja
-- Check for working C compiler using: Ninja -- broken
CMake Error at /Applications/CMake 2.8-12.app/Contents/share/cmake-2.8/Modules/CMakeTestCCompiler.cmake:61 (message):
  The C compiler "/usr/bin/cc" is not able to compile a simple test program.

  It fails with the following output:

   Change Dir: /Users/2zr/build/ParaView-Superbuild/paraview/src/paraview-build/CMakeFiles/CMakeTmp

  ninja: build stopped: subcommand failed.

Even if I empty the CMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT variable, the system still tries to pass an empty -sysroot flag to clang causing it to choke. I removed the sysroot flag from the top-level CMakeLists.txt, but then the ParaView CMake setup fails for a reason I can?t seem to understand. I?m attaching the log showing the CMake output. The only obvious thing I see is the Fortran compiler. Is that required?

Thanks,
M

However, the site module exists when I run python. I'm building from a script so I can control the environment. Everything else seems to build just fine. However, nothing appears in the install directory for cpack to find. I can't tell if this build error is disrupting the process or something else is going wrong. What controls the pygments build so I can shut it off for now?

Thanks,

Thank you for the quick response!
I've tried with other plugins (very simple ones which expose vtkfilters), and it worked. 
I was able to make myfilter() work by  restarting the python shell after loading it (and sometimes also loading it via the LoadPlugin() command). The strange thing is that if there is some error while running script (for example, reading empty arrays), then myfile() is not recognized anymore, unless I restart the python interpreter (not necessarily paraview), but I was not really able to isolate the issue (I am just restarting the shell to make it work)
Thank you

I believe you should be accessing it as :

And not servermanager.myfilter.

Michael,

Are you using VS generator? Can you switch to using Ninja? You can
still use the MSVC compilers. The error is popping up when the build
is trying to compiler the pygments *.py files. You'll get the same
error later when it's trying to compile the ParaView *.py files.

Also, another thing to note is that Windows has issues with long
paths. So I'd suggest moving the superbuild source and build
directories to something lower to avoid those e.g. C:/tmp/pvs-src and
C:/tmp/pvs-build.

Finally, if you're using VS2012, you'll need to use a system Python.
Currently. the Python included in the superbuild is intended for
VS2008. Also VS2012, is currently untested. As a first pass, if
possible, I'd suggest using VS 2008. Once that's working, you can give
 VS2012 try. Hopefully, it should work (except the Python caveat), but
I am always wary of VS version differences.

I removed the sysroot flag from the top-level CMakeLists.txt, but then the ParaView CMake setup fails for a reason I can?t seem to understand. I?m attaching the log showing the CMake output. The only obvious thing I see is the Fortran compiler. Is that required?

Utkarsh,

Is Ninja also preferred if I am using VS2008 to build the superbuild on Windows? 

Is this the Ninja - http://martine.github.io/ninja/manual.html ?

Thanks

Michael,

Are you using VS generator? Can you switch to using Ninja? You can still use the MSVC compilers. The error is popping up when the build is trying to compiler the pygments *.py files. You'll get the same error later when it's trying to compile the ParaView *.py files.

Also, another thing to note is that Windows has issues with long paths. So I'd suggest moving the superbuild source and build directories to something lower to avoid those e.g. C:/tmp/pvs-src and C:/tmp/pvs-build.

Finally, if you're using VS2012, you'll need to use a system Python.
Currently. the Python included in the superbuild is intended for VS2008. Also VS2012, is currently untested. As a first pass, if possible, I'd suggest using VS 2008. Once that's working, you can give
 VS2012 try. Hopefully, it should work (except the Python caveat), but I am always wary of VS version differences.

Yes, that's indeed the Ninja. When using CMake, you just need to pick
the Ninja generator. For all intents and purposes it;s like nmake. So
you'll need to run CMake through the visual studio command prompt
(also the builds need to be triggered throught the command prompt)
otherwise you'll get compiler not working errors.

CMakeCache.txt from the top-level build directory would be the thing
to save. Next time, just copy this file into an empty build directory
and the run cmake.

The best option, however is to edit this file to only leave those
options that you manually set to keep it easier to read and better
handle changes in environment.

Oh, I think I error is this:

   LoadPlugin(.., ns=globals())

The namespace is the 3rd argument for LoadPlugin[1], not second.  So
either use the proper location, or use the keyword argument.

The strange thing is that if there is some error while running script (for example, reading empty arrays), then myfile() is not recognized anymore, unless I restart the python interpreter (not necessarily paraview), but I was not really able to isolate the issue (I am just restarting the shell to make it work)

This gets around the clang argument problem, but the ParaView CMake configuration step still fails for an unknown reason.

 It fails with the following output:

Even if I empty the CMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT variable, the system still tries to pass an empty -sysroot flag to clang causing it to choke. I removed the sysroot flag from the top-level CMakeLists.txt, but then the ParaView CMake setup fails for a reason I can?t seem to understand. I?m attaching the log showing the CMake output. The only obvious thing I see is the Fortran compiler. Is that required?

I'm using the Paraview 4 64 bit on os x 10.6.  Every now and then i can not write in the number fields unless i re-load the state.  This has always been a problem but it is more noticeable now that i'm doing a lot more post processing.  Why does Paraview do that and is there a way to fix it?

Hold off on using the superbuild on MountainLion for now. I'll track

Thanks for the update. I?m actually building on Mavericks, but our project is still supporting Mountain Lion so it will be good to have it work there.

Michael,

Hold off on using the superbuild on MountainLion for now. I'll track
the issues down and then let you know.

Hi,

      I?m having trouble getting the git-master version of the Superbuild running on OSX (10.9) with clang (5.1). Setting the CMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT variable causes the following error during CMake (2.8.12.2) generation for the ParaView subproject:

It fails with the following output:

Even if I empty the CMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT variable, the system still tries to pass an empty -sysroot flag to clang causing it to choke. I removed the sysroot flag from the top-level CMakeLists.txt, but then the ParaView CMake setup fails for a reason I can?t seem to understand. I?m attaching the log showing the CMake output. The only obvious thing I see is the Fortran compiler. Is that required?

Hi Ryan,

This is a known bug on Mac OS: http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=14311

We have not yet tracked down the problem that I know of. It has been a
while since I have run ParaView on a Mac, but if I recall correctly,
you could work around this by clicking in the render view and then
clicking back in the field where editing wasn't working, and that
would let you at least edit the number field you were changing.

Hope that helps,
Cory

Hi,

I?m looking for the option that turns off the outline in the 3D panel in the Quad View in ParaView git-master. This used to be in the view settings dialog, but that no longer exists and the settings dialog doesn?t seem to have it unless I missed it. The Slice View has a similar option in the Properties panel under Background, but nothing appears there for the Quad View.

Thanks,
M

Hi

I am compiling PV with qt 5.2.1, internal VTK and boost 1.55 (for ReebGraph), under 64bit (without python) and get following errors:

Min max unknown in protobuf, following patch works:
https://code.google.com/p/protobuf/issues/detail?id=531

I also get many

Adding #include <stddef.h> to common.h of protobuf solved that in porotobuf but I get it also in CommandLineArguments.cxx of vtksys where that solution does not worked...

Additionally I get many linker errors:

Hi Michael,

I don't think there is such option.
In fact, this must be due to the representation be set to "Outline" in the
toolbar.
If you change it to Surface of Wireframe you should not see anymore the
outline.

I?m providing a screenshot showing the option (Show Outline in 3D View) that appears in the View Settings dialog box in PV 3.98.1. The dialog was available from Edit/View Settings menu option. The 3D outline was effective when the Slice representation is used. This also brings up another issue. All the options that are in this dialog are not available either. I use the Quad View in a user distributed program and some of them use these options. They aren?t going to be happy when the upgrade removes them.

I think the "Show Outline in 3D View" on the Properties panel is
indeed the right option. The fact that it has no effect is a bug.

On my Mac from yesterday's master, the option does allow me to toggle the
outline.
I just forgot about that Slices representation...

Can someone explain what this option is supposed to do? Even in 3.98.1
it has no effect for me, or at least I don't see anything change.

Hi Utkarsh,

The outline only comes into effect when using the Slices representation in the Quad View. If you use the Surface rep, there is no outline.

I don't think there is such option.
In fact, this must be due to the representation be set to "Outline" in

If you change it to Surface of Wireframe you should not see anymore the

Alright, here's the final diagnosis :):

It's works as Seb was saying. What I was missing that I had not
selected the Slices "representation". Once Slices representation is
chosen, the "Show outline in 3D view" option starts working. This is
indeed the way the view behaves in 3.98.1 as well.

BTW, I am pushing an update to the git repo to better organize the
properties on the "Properties" panel for the Quad View.

Hello,

What is the difference between -DUSE_SYSTEM_python=OFF  and
-DUSE_SYSTEM_python=ON superbuild PV compile?  Are there things that I need
to setup differently between the two type of compile to make sure that PV is
picking up the right python version after I deploy the binary compiled?

Thanks

Attached is the patch (will be in git/master after next gatekeeper
review). I made all the properties "default" to avoid confusion.
Michael, feel free to suggest better default visibility options.

Thanks

USE_SYSTEM_python=OFF will result in ParaView compile and package it's
Python version. USE_SYSTEM_python=ON will result in ParaView using a
version installed on your system. Thus the bundle won't be work on any
other systems where the Python you build against isn't available.

With USE_SYSTEM_python=ON, advanced CMAke options will allow you to
pick which Python libraries and executables to use for the build
(similar to what one sets in  a regular ParaView build).

Thanks Utkarsh. Then PV compiled with USE_SYSTEM_python=OFF, none of the 
system installed python related packages (numpy, scipy, etc, etc) will work in 
PV right? And only those python packages (numpy) included in the PV superbuild 
process are available for use. Right?

Thanks

You're absolutely right. In general, if you're building a package to
deploy on the same machine you should use-system-*=ON for as many
components are possible including Python, MPI, (and maybe even Qt).

Subject: [Paraview] Replacement for colorByArray
Message-ID: <D0727007-7987-4C9C-9C59-991270AE5FC4@ornl.gov>

Hi,

I have an application that I?m trying to conform back to git-master in preparation for the version 4.2 release. In the application, I used the pqPipelineRepresentation::colorByArray function to preset the colormap array before the data is rendered. I see that this function has been removed. I did a bit of digging and tried to use the following as a replacement (signal is our default array name):

pqDataRepresentation *drep = objectBuilder->createDataRepresentation(?);
vtkSMPropertyHelper(drep->getProxy(), ?Representation?).Set(?Surface?);
vtkSMPropertyHelper(drep->getProxy(), ?ColorArrayName?).Set(?signal?);
drep->getProxy()->UpdateVTKObjects();

However, this doesn?t seem to set the correct array as the view shows Solid Color for the array when it renders. I?m either invoking things incorrectly or at the wrong time, but I don?t know what. What am I missing or is there a more appropriate alternative to this method?

Thanks,
M

Hi Kazuyoshi,

I've tracked down the segfault, which results from a bug in the VTK VRML
importer class.  You will get the same thing if you delete a VRML Reader
and re-create it.  It will affect any current build of ParaView.  Fixing it
is going to require restructuring that class somewhat and will take a day
or two.  For now, just try to avoid this particular use case if possible
and I'll let you know as soon as it is fixed and merged into ParaView.

-Shawn

Hi Michael,

Checkout out "vtkSMPVRepresentationProxy::SetScalarColoring(...)".
I think that's what you are looking for.

Hi Yumin,

Thanks for the pointer as now the array is set. My next problem is that the transfer function range is (0, 1) and not the range of my array. I tried using vtkSMPVRepresentationProxy::RescaleTransferFunctionToDataRange, but ParaView gives a Could not determine array range warning. I wedged a UpdateVTKObjects() between the two calls but that didn?t help. What?s the right way to do this?

As a larger issue, I?m seeing that my old (PV 3.98.1 based) application is not liking how PV 4.2 is handling things. Is there any documentation or good examples of how things should be done for 4.2? My focus is on how to programmatically do things like: source and filter creation, pipeline construction and manipulation, manage different views, color map/transfer function manipulation, camera resetting. Now is the perfect time for a bit of a rewrite, but I?d definitely like to align things to how 4.2 wants things done.

Thanks,
M

In the application, I used the pqPipelineRepresentation::colorByArray function to preset the colormap array before the data is rendered. I see that this function has been removed. I did a bit of digging and tried to use the following as a replacement (signal is our default array name):

pqDataRepresentation *drep = objectBuilder->createDataRepresentation(?);
vtkSMPropertyHelper(drep->getProxy(), ?Representation?).Set(?Surface?);
vtkSMPropertyHelper(drep->getProxy(), ?ColorArrayName?).Set(?signal?);
drep->getProxy()->UpdateVTKObjects();

However, this doesn?t seem to set the correct array as the view shows Solid Color for the array when it renders. I?m either invoking things incorrectly or at the wrong time, but I don?t know what. What am I missing or is there a more appropriate alternative to this method?

Subject: [Paraview] Paraviewweb and Amazon EC2 instance: X display,
 GPU option, parallel visualization, launcher...
Message-ID: <1409925879253.99854@masonlive.gmu.edu>

Dear all,

I have installed Paraviewweb on an Amazon EC2 GPU instance based on the installation guide at:

http://www.paraview.org/ParaView3/Doc/Nightly/www/js-doc/index.html#!/guide/paraviewweb_on_aws_ec2. The webpages under "apps" can show up correctly. Now I am trying to install the parallel visualization. Here are a few questions I want to verify:


1. When I run pvpython on the GPU instance, I got the error message saying "bad X display..". I guess this occurs when the instance does not have a "real graphics" card and "off screen rendering" option should be used. My question is will this error affect the Paraviewweb application?


2.  I have installed Paraview (not Paraviewweb) on two other instances (without GPU) which run MPI without any issues. I would like to use those two instances as a part of the parallel visualization framework. Should I install the Paraviewweb on those two instances as well? Or I just need to change the machine configuration file to include the two instances?


3.  It seems GPU is needed for the instance when I configured the Paraviewweb on Amazon  EC2. There is a option for NVIDIA.. But  I read this document:

http://www.paraview.org/ParaView3/Doc/Nightly/www/js-doc/index.html#!/guide/os_mesa which says GPU may not be necessary. Is this applicable to Amazon EC2 instances?


4.  Launcher (

http://www.paraview.org/ParaView3/Doc/Nightly/www/js-doc/index.html#!/guide/parallel_app). I'm not sure if I should modify the  pw.session.public.fields if I am going to use the default Parallel example provided by Paraviewweb to start with.


Sorry about throwing out so many  questions but Paraviewweb is a very interesting application to explore.


Thanks,

Jing

launcher, which is totally fine.  In that case, you would set up a few
key/vals to allow that launcher to start the server side application you're
interested, the parallel visualization launcher in your case.  That's all
covered in the guide you linked.  Then you would indeed need to make sure
you add "file" to those session fields as the documentation states.

On the other hand, you might want to consider using the Python launcher
instead of the Jetty launcher.  It comes within ParaView so you don't have
another software stack to worry about, and it has all the same capabilities
and more.  For those reasons, we currently recommend the Python launcher
over the Jetty one.  You can find information about the Python launcher here
<http://www.paraview.org/ParaView3/Doc/Nightly/www/js-doc/index.html#!/guide/py_launcher>

Hi Jing,

   Make sure to turn on OSMesa support too, see here
<http://www.paraview.org/ParaView3/Doc/Nightly/www/js-doc/index.html#!/guide/os_mesa>
or here <http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView_And_Mesa_3D> for details.
 And the fastest offscreen rendering involves using Gallium llvmpipe.  If
you're interested in that, the first link has instructions on buidling a
version of OSMesa that includes Gallium llvmpipe, as well as how to then
compile ParaView to take advantage of it.

   Hope that helps.

Cheers,
Scott

Hi Scott,

Thanks for your answers and recommendations.


When I complied and installed Paraview on my two instances, I turned the Python option ON but did not turn off VTK-USE-X.  I will go ahead to recompile Paraview again and check the Python launcher.


Thanks again.

Jing

1. When I run pvpython on the GPU instance, I got the error message saying "bad X display..". I guess this occurs when the instance does not have a "real graphics" card and "off screen rendering" option should be used. My question is will this error affect the Paraviewweb application?


ParaViewWeb is just ParaView with Python turned on.  If you get a binary version, this is already done for you.  If you compile it yourself, make sure to enable Python during the configure stage.  At any rate, yes, ParaViewWeb is affected the same as ParaView by not having a graphics card.

2.  I have installed Paraview (not Paraviewweb) on two other instances (without GPU) which run MPI without any issues. I would like to use those two instances as a part of the parallel visualization framework. Should I install the Paraviewweb on those two instances as well? Or I just need to change the machine configuration file to include the two instances?


If you installed ParaView on those two instances, and if those installations of ParaView include Python, then you're good to go.  Unless they don't have graphics cards and you installed the binary version, as mentioned above.

3.  It seems GPU is needed for the instance when I configured the Paraviewweb on Amazon  EC2. There is a option for NVIDIA.. But  I read this document:

http://www.paraview.org/ParaView3/Doc/Nightly/www/js-doc/index.html#!/guide/os_mesa which says GPU may not be necessary. Is this applicable to Amazon EC2 instances?


Yep, it is.  But again, you have to compile ParaView yourself.  See the guide you referenced above for information on how to do that.  Also there's a ParaView wiki page<http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView_And_Mesa_3D> with information on that.

4.  Launcher (

http://www.paraview.org/ParaView3/Doc/Nightly/www/js-doc/index.html#!/guide/parallel_app). I'm not sure if I should modify the  pw.session.public.fields if I am going to use the default Parallel example provided by Paraviewweb to start with.


The ParaViewWeb on EC2 documentation describes setting up the Jetty launcher, which is totally fine.  In that case, you would set up a few key/vals to allow that launcher to start the server side application you're interested, the parallel visualization launcher in your case.  That's all covered in the guide you linked.  Then you would indeed need to make sure you add "file" to those session fields as the documentation states.

On the other hand, you might want to consider using the Python launcher instead of the Jetty launcher.  It comes within ParaView so you don't have another software stack to worry about, and it has all the same capabilities and more.  For those reasons, we currently recommend the Python launcher over the Jetty one.  You can find information about the Python launcher here<http://www.paraview.org/ParaView3/Doc/Nightly/www/js-doc/index.html#!/guide/py_launcher>.

Sorry about throwing out so many  questions but Paraviewweb is a very interesting application to explore.


No worries, thanks for your interest!  Hopefully you now have what you need to get started.

Cheers,
Scott

Thanks,

Jing

I switched to Ninja and shortened up the paths, but what really got things working was passing the VTK_USE_SYSTEM_PYGMENTS down to the ParaView CMake config via the PV_EXTRA_CMAKE_ARGS. After that, the build went smoothly. I hit a snag on creating the package because I?m triggering the USE_SYSTEM_matplotlib option and the Projects/win32/paraview.bundle.cmake does not trap the copying of matplotlib related items when this flag is used. I see a similar issue in the Projects/apple/paraview.bundle.cmake file as well. I added a AND NOT USE_SYSTEM_matplotlib to the if (matplotlib_ENABLED) line and that fixed the generated cmake_install.cmake file and the package created fine. I?ve tested the resulting package and so far so good.

Michael,

Are you using VS generator? Can you switch to using Ninja? You can
still use the MSVC compilers. The error is popping up when the build
is trying to compiler the pygments *.py files. You'll get the same
error later when it's trying to compile the ParaView *.py files.

Also, another thing to note is that Windows has issues with long
paths. So I'd suggest moving the superbuild source and build
directories to something lower to avoid those e.g. C:/tmp/pvs-src and
C:/tmp/pvs-build.

Finally, if you're using VS2012, you'll need to use a system Python.
Currently. the Python included in the superbuild is intended for
VS2008. Also VS2012, is currently untested. As a first pass, if
possible, I'd suggest using VS 2008. Once that's working, you can give
VS2012 try. Hopefully, it should work (except the Python caveat), but
I am always wary of VS version differences.

However, the site module exists when I run python. I?m building from a

fine. However, nothing appears in the install directory for cpack to find. I
can?t tell if this build error is disrupting the process or something else
is going wrong. What controls the pygments build so I can shut it off for

Great! Which VS was this? The Pygments thing should be tracked down.
I'll see what's happening there. BTW, I am making progress on
Mavericks build. I think I have most things ironed out. I'll send an
updated email once I have dashboard testing it.

Try adding UpdatePipeline() after UpdateVTKObjects() before calling
RescaleTransferFunctionToDataRange(). The UpdatePipeline() will force the
pipeline to update so that the array information is set up properly.

AFAIK, there is no such document available (yet). However, we do have a
primary list that could be useful to people trying to convert pv-3.98 based
applications to pv-4.2. We (Utkarsh and I) are still working on this list,
and will put it up on the wiki once it is formalized a bit more.

Hi Jing,

   I have copied the paraview list here so that everyone can benefit from
the conversation.

   So don't worry, it's not a silly question.  I don't think it's totally
clear in the documentation, as there are several places where 'host' shows
up as a key.  There's one 'host' in the 'resources' section, and there's
another in the 'configuration' section, and those should be fine left as
localhost in your situation.  The one you probably need to worry about is
the one that is embedded in the 'sessionURL', as this is what clients will
use to connect through to the visualization process.  That hostname (in the
'sessionURL') should be changed to the public DNS of the Amazon instance
(or the IP could work fine too I guess).

   However, you mentioned you have installed Apache, so I guess you're
going to use that as a front end?  Then you want to make sure you create
your Apache VirtualHost and set the sessionURL as you find them in this
guide
<http://www.paraview.org/ParaView3/Doc/Nightly/www/js-doc/index.html#!/guide/ubuntu_14_04>,
because Apache is going to intercept those session urls which contain the
unique key from the launcher and re-write them so they get to the correct
port where the visualization process is listening.

   I'm currently overhauling some of those ParaViewWeb guiedes, so I'll try
to make sure that stuff is clearer.

Cheers,
Scott

Hi Scott,

Thanks for your clarification. Yes. I am using Apache as the front end. The link you included is very helpful!

Hi Jing,

   Make sure to turn on OSMesa support too, see here<http://www.paraview.org/ParaView3/Doc/Nightly/www/js-doc/index.html#!/guide/os_mesa> or here<http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView_And_Mesa_3D> for details.  And the fastest offscreen rendering involves using Gallium llvmpipe.  If you're interested in that, the first link has instructions on buidling a version of OSMesa that includes Gallium llvmpipe, as well as how to then compile ParaView to take advantage of it.

   Hope that helps.

Dear all,

I have installed Paraviewweb on an Amazon EC2 GPU instance based on the installation guide at:

http://www.paraview.org/ParaView3/Doc/Nightly/www/js-doc/index.html#!/guide/paraviewweb_on_aws_ec2. The webpages under "apps" can show up correctly. Now I am trying to install the parallel visualization. Here are a few questions I want to verify:


Since the instructions you referenced describe installing a binary version, I assume that's what you did.  However, those instructions assumed an instance with a graphics card, hence all the instructions specific to NVidia.  If you have chosen an instance without a graphics card, you can't use the binary installation of ParaView, instead you'll need to compile ParaView yourself with support for OSMesa.

1. When I run pvpython on the GPU instance, I got the error message saying "bad X display..". I guess this occurs when the instance does not have a "real graphics" card and "off screen rendering" option should be used. My question is will this error affect the Paraviewweb application?


ParaViewWeb is just ParaView with Python turned on.  If you get a binary version, this is already done for you.  If you compile it yourself, make sure to enable Python during the configure stage.  At any rate, yes, ParaViewWeb is affected the same as ParaView by not having a graphics card.

2.  I have installed Paraview (not Paraviewweb) on two other instances (without GPU) which run MPI without any issues. I would like to use those two instances as a part of the parallel visualization framework. Should I install the Paraviewweb on those two instances as well? Or I just need to change the machine configuration file to include the two instances?


If you installed ParaView on those two instances, and if those installations of ParaView include Python, then you're good to go.  Unless they don't have graphics cards and you installed the binary version, as mentioned above.

3.  It seems GPU is needed for the instance when I configured the Paraviewweb on Amazon  EC2. There is a option for NVIDIA.. But  I read this document:

http://www.paraview.org/ParaView3/Doc/Nightly/www/js-doc/index.html#!/guide/os_mesa which says GPU may not be necessary. Is this applicable to Amazon EC2 instances?


Yep, it is.  But again, you have to compile ParaView yourself.  See the guide you referenced above for information on how to do that.  Also there's a ParaView wiki page<http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView_And_Mesa_3D> with information on that.

4.  Launcher (

http://www.paraview.org/ParaView3/Doc/Nightly/www/js-doc/index.html#!/guide/parallel_app). I'm not sure if I should modify the  pw.session.public.fields if I am going to use the default Parallel example provided by Paraviewweb to start with.


The ParaViewWeb on EC2 documentation describes setting up the Jetty launcher, which is totally fine.  In that case, you would set up a few key/vals to allow that launcher to start the server side application you're interested, the parallel visualization launcher in your case.  That's all covered in the guide you linked.  Then you would indeed need to make sure you add "file" to those session fields as the documentation states.

On the other hand, you might want to consider using the Python launcher instead of the Jetty launcher.  It comes within ParaView so you don't have another software stack to worry about, and it has all the same capabilities and more.  For those reasons, we currently recommend the Python launcher over the Jetty one.  You can find information about the Python launcher here<http://www.paraview.org/ParaView3/Doc/Nightly/www/js-doc/index.html#!/guide/py_launcher>.

Sorry about throwing out so many  questions but Paraviewweb is a very interesting application to explore.


No worries, thanks for your interest!  Hopefully you now have what you need to get started.

Cheers,
Scott

Thanks,

Jing

Hi all,


I want to export screenshots of stereo images with Python.
The stereo mode is SplitViewportHorizontal (Side-by-Side).

When I export images larger than active views, I get bad results as the attached image.
How can I export large stereo screenshots correctly?
Or I?m planning to export left and right-eye images separately, and composite them
with other softwares.
How can I export left or right-eye images with Python?

Alright, Superbuild + Mavericks is now working as expected. It's now
tested on the dashboards too:

You can use the Glyph With Custom Source filter. This filter works like the standard Glyph filter but it allows you to input an arbitrary polydata to center on each point rather a predefined shape.

After updating the Superbuild code and cleaning house, I was still seeing the ParaView CMake configure failure I reported before. I did a bit of digging and found that the generated pv-paraview-build.cmake was trying to execute the following command: step_command-NOTFOUND. It seems to be related to trying to use ninja instead of make files. I switched to make files and the build is in progress.

Thanks,

Hi Berk,
Thanks for your reply. The original Netcdf file is a regular spaced 3D dataset with a lot of filled values.  I plan to reorganize the data with AMR or some other more efficient structures for rendering. I am developing Python functions to resample Netcdf files but I am not sure if this is the right direction.

Any suggestions are highly appreciated.

So that I understand, does your NetCDF file already contain some sort of hierarchy or are you after adaptively rendering it by creating the hierarchy on the fly?

I'd like to use the octree structure to reorganize the 3D NetCDF data to make the rendering more efficient. If using octree is not possible, how about using AMR?

Message-ID: <FDD718B5-590A-4542-8F26-B08EDB406283@llnl.gov>

Hi,
I am wondering how to write out a set of VTK files for input into paraview.
The code we are writing from is Miranda, an MPI code, and each processor writes out its subdomain individually.  No ghost zones are written into the files.  Perhaps they could be; I?m not sure about that part.
Sometimes the data is curvilinear but usually rectilinear.
Miranda is included in the VISIT_BRIDGE stuff but what?s in VISIT_BRIDGE for Miranda is old and the newer stuff doesn?t parse any more.
Thanks!

Could you write your data into HDF5 files and try the xdmf format for
visualization.

Message-ID: <20140909.135736.71465939.furutaka.kazuyoshi@jaea.go.jp>

Dear ParaView experts...

Is there any way to knwo what the type of a view is
within a python macro (e.g. from the return value of
GetRenderView())?
I'd like to know whether an exisiting view is, say, a
'MultiSlice' or not (and create one if none exists).

Thanks in advance.

Kazuyoshi,

You should be able to use

type(GetRenderView())

or

GetRenderView().GetClassName()

to find out what type of view you have.

Hope that helps,
Cory

Dear Cory,

Thanks for your immediate response!

The latter (GetRenderView().GetClassName()) is
what I want!

Andrew,

Today's gatekeeper review brought in fixes to address the Qt 5.3 build
issue. The CMake warnings still remain. I'll have them diagnosed
soonish.

You need to set the following paraview flags to enable Silo and CGNS.

VISIT_BUILD_READER_Silo=ON
VISIT_BUILD_READER_CGNS=ON

Subject: [Paraview] vts file format
Message-ID: <1410382591.84710.YahooMailNeo@web121202.mail.ne1.yahoo.com>

Hi everybody,

I'm trying to convert a big csv file to a simple structured grid (100x100x136). I imported it to Pra-view, but I could not convert it to grid using Filters-> "Table to Structured Grid". another attempt was creating a vts/vtk file from my csv file, but the structure of file is ambiguous. I couldn't find any example. 
In VTK pdf file regarding file formats, there is just an example for structured point (page.18), I copied and pasted this example in Notepad++ and saved with .vts and vtk extension, but I could not open in in Paraview (4.2.0 RC1 64-bit).

Do you have any example file or comment on the file structure?

Thanks

Hey Rich,

Is this a matter of updating the VisIt bridge or the code in VisIt is old
too?

What are the larger runs these folks do? And what is the timeframe?

We are working on ADIOS readers and that may be another option. This is
where we currently plan on pushing for large scale IO needs.

HDF5 is certainly another option. So is writing legacy VTK files from each
node. I'd guess Silo is another option too.

It depends on the needs and scale at which they will be running.

Best,

The code in VisIt is up to date; it?s just Paraview that seems behind the times.  I am not able to completely convince myself of why but I suspect that?s the problem.  The actual error shows up as some sort of VTK error.

Rich,

FYI, the VisIt bridge was updated to VisIt 2.7.0 soon after 4.1. You
can try 4.2-RC1 to see if this was indeed a VisIt bridge being old
issue.

Michael, with VS2012, what was your selection for Python? Were you
using system Python or did you let the superbuild build its own?

Are you sure it's a "structured grid" or is an "image data"? Refer to this
for difference between the two:
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Users_Guide/VTK_Data_Model

Programmable filer may be the easiest way to go. Attached is an extract
from the ParaView User's Guide that's currently being updated. A
combination of recipes shown in Sections 14.2.1 and 14.2.4 is what should
help.

I used a system Python which is pointed at a Python we distribute with Mantid on Windows. BTW, do you want me to pass along the patches I have for the USE_SYSTEM_matplotlib issues I run into, or should I just handle those in a Superbuild fork?

Thanks,
M

Are you using VS generator? Can you switch to using Ninja? You can
still use the MSVC compilers. The error is popping up when the build
is trying to compiler the pygments *.py files. You'll get the same
error later when it's trying to compile the ParaView *.py files.

Also, another thing to note is that Windows has issues with long
paths. So I'd suggest moving the superbuild source and build
directories to something lower to avoid those e.g. C:/tmp/pvs-src and
C:/tmp/pvs-build.

Finally, if you're using VS2012, you'll need to use a system Python.
Currently. the Python included in the superbuild is intended for
VS2008. Also VS2012, is currently untested. As a first pass, if

VS2012 try. Hopefully, it should work (except the Python caveat), but

Michael,

The patches would be great! I don't think we tested with system Python on
Windows.

The patches are attached. They aren?t much but they help get the package (on Windows and OSX) built without issues. The package I made against the system Python seems to work OK although I have not exhaustively tested it. The python interpreter interaction inside ParaView seems to work fine with the few tests and examples I ran on it.

Cannot build 4.2-RC1.  I get this error.  I?ve reported it before, but now it halts the build, so it needs to get fixed and I don?t know the answer: 

Compiling /usr/local/tools/paraview-opengl-4.2.0/src/ParaView-v4.2.0-Build/lib/site-packages/vtk/web/testing.py ...
SyntaxError: ('invalid syntax', ('/usr/local/tools/paraview-opengl-4.2.0/src/ParaView-v4.2.0-Build/lib/site-packages/vtk/web/testing.py', 76, 47, 'TestModuleBrowsers = type("Enum", (), {k: i for i, k in enumerate(test_module_browsers)})\n'))

What?s strange about that line is that in our python on our clusters, that line compiles just fine.  So perhaps there is a bug in whatever is compiling testing.py?

What I do is as follows (probably overkill, but hey), in Python

path = os.environ.get('PATH')
os.environ['PATH']=pythonInstallDir+'/bin/:'+path

path = os.environ.get('LD_LIBRARY_PATH')
os.environ['LD_LIBRARY_PATH']=pythonInstallDir+'/lib/:'+path

path = os.environ.get('PYTHONPATH')
if path is  None:
  os.environ['PYTHONPATH']=pythonInstallDir+'/lib/python2.7:'
else:
  os.environ['PYTHONPATH']=pythonInstallDir+'/lib/python2.7:'+path


if (buildPython == 'true') :
    cMakeVars = cMakeVars +\
                '-DPARAVIEW_ENABLE_PYTHON:BOOL=ON '
else :
    cMakeVars = cMakeVars +\
                '-DPARAVIEW_ENABLE_PYTHON:BOOL=OFF '

cMakeVars = cMakeVars +\
        '-DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE:FILEPATH='+pythonInstallDir+'/bin/python '+\
        '-DPYTHON_INCLUDE_PATH:PATH='+pythonInstallDir+'/include/python2.7/ '+\
        '-DPYTHON_LIBRARY:FILEPATH='+pythonInstallDir+'/lib/libpython2.7.so '

Message-ID: <9aaec371d2464398be869e272feb22df@ES05AMSNLNT.srn.sandia.gov>

I am trying to figure out the FFT of selection over time filter.  My user is trying to use it on a velocity point vector field (in 2d, no less).  So, a few questions:
*       This filter doesn't work on point data, but only cell data.  Shouldn't it work on point data?
*       This filter doesn't create magnitudes of vectors.  Shouldn't it if needed?
*       Since an FFT spans some array of data, shouldn't this span be changeable?  For instance, 16 or 32 or 128?
*       Does this filter even work correctly?  Has anyone ever used it?
*       Can anyone create a simple example using this filter?

Thanks,


Alan

Subject: [Paraview] How to simply "Reload" a data file
Message-ID: <F9562F3B302F29479A203FC5AF9E3E0533C78F@SERBE4I1.intra.erbe-med.de>

Hi,

I wanted to try the "Reload" button which presumably can be created by one of the methods outlined below. But I am maybe too naive or am missing something: I have a Windoze binary distribution of ParaView 4.0.1. I did not find the file indicated by Cory, and copying the xml code given by S?bastien into a file and loading that as plugin had no effect visible to me.

What am I missing here?

Thank you,

Matthias

Matthias,

The method I suggested requires modifying ParaView's source code, so
it won't work for a binary distribution.

As for the XML method, did you try to load an Xdmf file through what
should be the new "Xdmf Reader (Refresh button)" reader? If you are
loading a different type of file, this plugin will have no effect
because it provides a Refresh button only for the Xdmf reader. You
could modify the XML for other reader types, though.

Thanks,
Cory

Hi  Cory,

I use the reader for vtu format and pvd (vtu time collection). I tried to modify the xml as follows:

<ParaViewPlugin>
<ServerManagerConfiguration>
  <ProxyGroup name="sources">
<SourceProxy name="VTUrefresh" base_proxygroup="sources" base_proxyname="VTUReader" class="vtuReader">
      <Property name="Refresh" command="Modified" panel_widget="command_button"/>
      <Hints>
        <ReaderFactory extensions="vtu pvd" file_description="vtu Reader (Refresh button)" />
      </Hints>
    </SourceProxy>
  </ProxyGroup>
  </ServerManagerConfiguration>
  <ParaViewReaders>
    <Reader name="ReaderWithButton" />
  </ParaViewReaders>
</ParaViewPlugin>

But I cannot even load it as plugin. Presumably there are special keyword to use for the name of the original reader. Is there a documentation where I can find more information on that topic?

Thanks,

Matthias

I suspect will not work with vtu. To understand this better, what is
that which is changing that you need to reload the file? Are you
loading a file series or a single file?

 Custom Dock Widget: How to automatically add a glyph3d filter after

Message-ID: <5416F67D.4090602@inutech.de>

I would like to automatically add a glyph filter and render the 
correctly scaled spheres after the user has opened a file in my custom 
dock widget.
I created a DockWidget using the example in /examples/Plugins/DockWidget.
When pressing a button a specific file is being opened for the user by 
the following calls:

  void on_button_clicked()
{
         QStringxdmfFile="C:\\..\\unknown_case.xdmf";

     QStringList  visuFiles;

     visuFiles.append(xdmfFile);

     pqPipelineSource*  pqPlinesource  =  pqLoadDataReaction::loadData(visuFiles);

     pqPlinesource->updatePipeline();

    // TODO:
    // add spherical glyph for loaded polyData
    // scale spherical glyphs by a scalar attribute/property
    // render glyphs

}

I would like to include that the code automatically adds spherical 
glyphs and renders them for the data just loaded.

I tried the following code but I am not sure if it works

vtkSMProxy*myProxy=pqPlinesource->getProxy();

         vtkObjectBase  *myObject  =  myProxy->GetClientSideObject();

         vtkAlgorithm  *myvtkAlgo  =  vtkAlgorithm::SafeDownCast(myObject);

         vtkGlyph3D  *myspheres  =   vtkGlyph3D::New();

         myspheres->SetSourceConnection(myvtkAlgo->GetOutputPort());



In case this is supposed to work, how can I now update the pipeline and 
render the spheres using C++ PV core functionality ? (The user should 
also see the result in the pipeline browser dock of the GUI).

In case my approach is totally wrong, what would be the right way of 
handling this situation ?

Thank you.

Best regards,

Florian

Normally I load a time series, either a series of vtu files or a time collection (pvd file containing the vtu file names with asociated timestamps). During the simulation, new files are added to the series. So it would be nice to watch the simulation going on by reloading from time to time.

Ah. since it's a file series, it would not work the way Cory is
suggesting. I'll see if I can cook up a Python script that can make
this possible for now. We're putting this on the roadmap for the next
release (I know I've said that a few times in the past :) ).

Attached is an example based on ParaView 4.2-RC1. As it shows, you
cannot directly use VTK objects to create visualization pipelines in
ParaView. While this can surely be done with 4.1 or earlier, I'd
suggest basing off 4.2, if possible since it simplified a lot of this
initialization.

Subject: [Paraview] [EXTERNAL]  fft of selection over time filter

Alan,

I assume you are talking about the FFT of Selection Over Time filter. I'm not sure I understand all of your questions but I'll try to answer them.


  *   I got the filter to work on point data. Two caveats though. First, I think the data needs to be of a scalar floating point type. It doesn't work on vectors and it doesn't seem to work on ids. You also need to make a point selection (vs. a cell selection). I also noticed some funniness with how the selection got populated in the filter. For some reason when I create the filter it does not seem to populate the active selection correctly. I have to hit the "Copy Active Selection" button for it to get my selection properly.
  *   [Shrug] Most filter's don't automatically create magnitudes of vectors. I guess if auto convert feature is on maybe it should, but that could also be expensive since the filter takes the FFT of all fields, not just one selected field.
  *   You mean pick some range of time to apply the FFT over? That should have more to do with clipping the data values than picking some number of values to apply the FFT to. Is there a use case for that feature?
  *   I recall implementing the filter a while ago. It's a little flaky, but it seems to work on the can dataset.
  *   Open can.ex2. Select a cell at the bottom of the can. Add the FFT of Selection Over Time filter. Click "Copy Active Selection". Apply. You get a plot that is in kind of a U shape.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [Paraview] fft of selection over time filter

I am trying to figure out the FFT of selection over time filter.  My user is trying to use it on a velocity point vector field (in 2d, no less).  So, a few questions:

  *   This filter doesn't work on point data, but only cell data.  Shouldn't it work on point data?
  *   This filter doesn't create magnitudes of vectors.  Shouldn't it if needed?
  *   Since an FFT spans some array of data, shouldn't this span be changeable?  For instance, 16 or 32 or 128?
  *   Does this filter even work correctly?  Has anyone ever used it?
  *   Can anyone create a simple example using this filter?


Thanks,


Alan

Subject: [Paraview] Data structure for 'table to structured grid' filter
Message-ID: <CAJwnGVu2AY-pC1PJmc7uhNAyozj3ZEAEQwWi6Fe=fC7Wg4=gsg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I met a problem when I  converted table data to structured grid. The data
is arranged as attached test.csv file. I set up Whole extent as ((0,2),
(0,2), (0,1)). But the grid system does not look right.  See below. I think
the problem is the data ordering problem that are usually talked about in
previous threads. Can anyone give a example of how to use this filter or
give me some information on how to do it correctly. Thanks for all your
considering.

Hi,

I think the issue is that your ordering is wrong. VTK/ParaView assumes that
you iterate over x the fastest, then y, and z is iterated over the slowest.

For the table to structured grid filter, if you set the whole extent to [0,
2, 0, 1, 0, 2] and the X Column to y, Y Column to z and Z Column to x then
at least the connectivity looks correct. If this output has the wrong
orientation you can either change the ordering of the CXV file or use the
transform filter to rotate it around.

Subject: [Paraview] Open File Dialog Box Hang on OSX
Message-ID: <90C865AD-8A61-4526-96CB-143CA90D709C@cs.olemiss.edu>

Hello,
   I wanted to post a solution to a problem that I had with ParaView 4.1.0 on Mac OSX 10.9.4.   The problem was a hang (not a crash) when selecting the ?Open? file menu item. The dialog box eventually appeared after a spinning beachball went away, but then complained that it could not find a certain AppleShare volume that was no longer in use on our local network. The dialog box also listed items that were taken from the Finder Sidebar, but were very out of date. 

  This last point made me realize what was going on. Paraview was (perhaps indirectly) reading stale information out of ~/Library/Preferences/org.apple.sidebarlists.plist . Upon inspection, I found the stale info in this file.  It seems that back in 2011 the finder was updated, and no longer uses some of this information, but Paraview still does. 

  I removed this file and also set my finder sidebar preferences to not display shared volumes, or anything that I didn?t strictly need. You may find a restart is necessary in order for the change to take effect, but I?ve fixed the problem on three machines.  I?m not sure how widespread this problem is, or if it?s even specifically a Paraview issue, but I thought I?d post the information in case it?s helpful to someone.

Hi Andy,

It works in your way. Can you provide more information on how to make a
correct ordering of points. I don't understand how the connectivity is
built in Paraview. Any sources for me to refer to? Thank you.

had someone ask me for help with a problem they were having with paraview v4.1.0 in server/client mode.

steps are: i) read in an ensight case file, ii) use Extract Block filter to yank out a particular block,  iii) color extracted block with various variables.
simple enough.

let me say up front that the data is pretty small (order of 100k points, 450k cells).
we ran this using a varying number of procs in a single node.

when the number of procs got to be 14 or greater (16 cores in the server nodes) the extract block step lost the data variables.
the geometry was correct still but none of the data variables survived the operation.

I'll stipulate that it makes little sense to use more than one proc for data this small.

but why does the extract block not still work?

slightly puzzled.

Hey Mike,

I'm getting something funky when reading an Ensight file with 14 processes
as well that I don't see with 2 or 13 processes (I didn't bother trying
with other amounts). The error I get is:
ERROR: In
/home/acbauer/CODE/ParaView/ParaView-v4.1.0/VTK/Common/DataModel/vtkDataSet.cxx,
line 414
vtkStructuredGrid (0xa70560): Point array DENS with 1 components, only has
-325 tuples but there are 0 points

This is just for loading in the file though and not even using the extract
block filter. Are you getting a similar error?

I'm getting the error with the naca.bin.case at
http://www.paraview.org/gitweb?p=ParaViewData.git;a=tree;f=Data/EnSight;h=fc6cbe6fc7851e2f3bae520f4cf4b933ab963c93;hb=HEAD.

in all cases for the ensight data we are working with, there is no READ error.
there is no error reported at all either for reading or extract block operations.

the extract block silently fails to pass the variable data for larger core counts on the data we are working on. geometry seems okay.

btw, I am not very fluent in my understanding of the ensight formats (case files or otherwise)

Hmm, well I have no idea if we're hitting the same bug or not but it seems
like too much of a coincidence that this is happening for both of us at 14
procs but not 13. I created a mantis issue at
http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=14996. Feel free to add to it if
you can share your Ensight file.

Andy

this just in.....

using the same data you are ( ParaViewdata: naca.bin.case, to eliminate one difference at least)

when I tried 16 procs on the server side the server seems to be hung. didn't crash the server (not yet at least)
but it might as well have because the client is frozen waiting on the server. the server is accumulating run time but nothing else.

Hmm, well I have no idea if we're hitting the same bug or not but it seems like too much of a coincidence that this is happening for both of us at 14 procs but not 13. I created a mantis issue at http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=14996. Feel free to add to it if you can share your Ensight file.

in all cases for the ensight data we are working with, there is no READ error.
there is no error reported at all either for reading or extract block operations.

the extract block silently fails to pass the variable data for larger core counts on the data we are working on. geometry seems okay.

btw, I am not very fluent in my understanding of the ensight formats (case files or otherwise)

Hey Mike,
I'm getting something funky when reading an Ensight file with 14 processes as well that I don't see with 2 or 13 processes (I didn't bother trying with other amounts). The error I get is:
ERROR: In /home/acbauer/CODE/ParaView/ParaView-v4.1.0/VTK/Common/DataModel/vtkDataSet.cxx, line 414
vtkStructuredGrid (0xa70560): Point array DENS with 1 components, only has -325 tuples but there are 0 points
This is just for loading in the file though and not even using the extract block filter. Are you getting a similar error?
I'm getting the error with the naca.bin.case at http://www.paraview.org/gitweb?p=ParaViewData.git;a=tree;f=Data/EnSight;h=fc6cbe6fc7851e2f3bae520f4cf4b933ab963c93;hb=HEAD.
Best,
Andy

had someone ask me for help with a problem they were having with paraview v4.1.0 in server/client mode.

steps are: i) read in an ensight case file, ii) use Extract Block filter to yank out a particular block,  iii) color extracted block with various variables.
simple enough.

let me say up front that the data is pretty small (order of 100k points, 450k cells).
we ran this using a varying number of procs in a single node.

when the number of procs got to be 14 or greater (16 cores in the server nodes) the extract block step lost the data variables.
the geometry was correct still but none of the data variables survived the operation.

I'll stipulate that it makes little sense to use more than one proc for data this small.

but why does the extract block not still work?

slightly puzzled.

If you check the output on the server you'll probably see the error I got.
Since the client is waiting for the server to finish the error doesn't pop
up on the client.

If your file is shareable, maybe you could add that to the bug tracker
since they might be different and I'd hate to assume we fixed your bug when
we only verified that we fixed my bug.

Subject: [Paraview] Parametric functions.
Message-ID: <CAHDsG9MjPUd3FC9zy8M1hnrmr0Da=GR6o9JOiyvmg+cw+CvTUg@mail.gmail.com>

A while back there was a request for something different from the usual
sphere source.

So I have created an xml file to access the parametric surface functions in
ParaView along with a reverse sense programmable filter. It was an
interesting exercise that revealed some deficiencies in the parametric
function implementations that have been fixed in the VTK master.

I am happy to contribute this if people feel it will be useful.

Just let me know how.


Regards
    Andrew

Subject: [Paraview] howto move an object depending on actual time
Message-ID: <54181208.3080906@gmail.com>

hello,

i would like to create an animation of moving objects using the 
animation view. unfortunately the positions of the objects stored within 
the data file are stationary, so i have to manually define the movement 
anyhow.

is there a simple method to archive this using the animation inspector? 
(i am using paraview 4.1.0)

alternatively i found a method to use the python calculator to translate 
the object. if i could access the actual time it would be possible to 
define the trajectory of the moving particle. is this possible?

thanks
FloB

Dear Utkarsh,

thank you very much for your fast reply and the provided example.
I compiled PV4.2RC2 from source and just tried to compile your example. 
Nevertheless I receive a compilation error complaining that the file

vtkSMParaViewPipelineControllerWithRendering.h

cannot be found.
Where is this file supposed to be residing ?

Thank you.

Best regards,

Florian

I'd suggest using "Programmable Filter" instead of "Python
Calculator". Refer to vtkTimeToTexConvertor::RequestData() [1] for how
to access DATA_TIME_STEP value. You can write an equivalent script in
"Script" part for the Programmable Filter to access the time value.

Subject: [Paraview] howto move an object depending on actual time

hi, thanks alot for the fast reply. DATA_TIME_STEP was the variable that 
i was looking for.
here is my "Programmable Filter Script" that is able to translate an 
object into a given direction depending on the actual timestep.

### paraview programmable filter script for translation of object 
depending on timestep

from vtk import vtkDataObject

from paraview.vtk import dataset_adapter as DA


speed = [0.0004, 0.000, 0.000]


# define input and output

pdi = self.GetInputDataObject(0,0)

pdo = self.GetOutputDataObject(0)

pdo.CopyAttributes(pdi)


# get current time-step

step = pdi.GetInformation().Get(vtkDataObject.DATA_TIME_STEP())


# move object

old_pts = inputs[0].Points

new_pts = old_pts

for i in range(3):

new_pts[:,i] = old_pts[:,i] + step * speed[i]


arr = DA.numpyTovtkDataArray(new_pts, 'newpts')

pdo.GetPoints().SetData(arr)



greetings
FloB

I have the file there as well but nevertheless during compilation of the Plugin it cannot be found.
Do you have any idea why this might be the case ?


Thanks.

Not entirely sure why. I just built that same with ParaVIew git/master
and it built fine for me. What OS is this? Can you attach
CMakeCache.txt from ParaView build as well as the plugin build?

Hello,

I would like to test out the xdmf3 writer in ParaView 4.2 RC to see if the file size is still increase 10 fold when saving pvd file to xmf format.

However, when I configure ParaView v4.2.0-RC1-75-gf64ee7a with -DModule_vtkIOXdmf3:BOOL=ON

cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/simonsm/tools/paraview/paraview-v4.2.0-RC1-75-gf64ee7a_mesa -DPARAVIEW_ENABLE_PYTHON:BOOL=ON -DPARAVIEW_USE_MPI:BOOL=ON -DPARAVIEW_ENABLE_WEB:BOOL=OFF -DModule_vtkIOXdmf3:BOOL=ON ../ParaView-v4.2.0-RC1-75-gf64ee7a

I got whole bunch of boost related cmake error with cmake version 3.0.0 and cmake version 2.8.12.2. Some of the error messages are included at the end of this email.

I am able to compile RC1-22-g9ca4e44 version ok but without Module_vtkIOXdmf3 set to ON. Is there anything on the boost side that I am not setting it right? I am compiling on RHEL 6.5 with boost-devel-1.41.0-18.el6.x86_64 installed.

thanks

Looks to be a CMake-ified boost. It worked here on Fedora with 1.54.0
(which I don't believe is built using CMake anymore). It seems that it
doesn't support multiple find_package calls. Try setting
Boost_NO_BOOST_CMAKE to ON to force the FindBoost.cmake logic to kick
in.

Subject: [Paraview] Python Scripting - Slicing Data
Message-ID: <CAO01ZkzwzgDOzTPhTJpFsAywt9MTDVyZRCOFY5E_hVJY3i5XOQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I'm trying to use a Python script to slice a 3D model in multiple locations
and interrogate the values at these slices.

Is it possible to apply the slice with a plane? I.e. intersect the model
with a pre-defined plane?

I can load and view my data and a plane I've defined (see below), but I
can't find how to slice/intersect them

Many thanks for your help,

Kevin

PYTHON SCRIPT:

from paraview.simple import *

# read data
data = PhastaReader(FileName="view.pht")
Show(data)
Render()

# define plane
plane1 = Plane()
plane1.Origin = [0, 0, 0]
plane1.Point1 = [1, 0, 0]
plane1.Point2 = [0, 1, 0]
Show(plane1)
Render()

# how to slice with the plane?

I'd recommend you use the Trace tools to see how to write the python code.
Get your data, apply the slice filter, and see how its arguments are set.

you'll end up with something like:

data = PhastaReader(FileName="view.pht")
Show(data)


slice = Slice(Input=data)

slice.SliceType = 'Plane'

slice.SliceOffsetValues = [0.0]
slice.SliceType.Origin = [0., 0., 0.]

slice.SliceType.Normal = [0.0, 1.0, 0.0]
Show()

thanks for the tip. I got the new reader compiled, but I am disappointed to see that it crashes immediately on my existing data (which can be read in parallel, with the old xdmf2 reader).

ERROR: In /apps/pilatus/ParaView/src/ParaView/VTK/Common/Core/vtkDataArrayTemplate.txx, line 148
vtkFloatArray (0x231e760): Unable to allocate 2790483579 elements of size 4 bytes.

I am usually reading with 64 MPI tasks and the xdmf2 reader works really well in parallel.
My grid  size is 313x897x3313 and I am reading a single vector field. The error message above indicates that the partitioning of the grid is not happening and that each MPI tasks is asking for the whole grid.

Dear Utkarsh,

thanks a lot. I made a small mistake during cmake configuration. It 
works fine.

Question: Where can I find the "keywords" for

vtkSMPropertyHelper(...)

For example you used:

vtkSMPropertyHelper(cylinder,"Resolution").Set(18);


I would like to setup the glyph's settings in a similar fashion. For 
example:

// your code
...

//Createandinitializetheglyphfilter

vtkSMSourceProxy*  glyph  =  vtkSMSourceProxy::SafeDownCast(pxm->NewProxy("filters",  "Glyph"));

controller->PreInitializeProxy(glyph);
vtkSMPropertyHelper(glyph,"Input").Set(cylinder);
vtkSMPropertyHelper(glyph,"Source").Set(getSphereSource(glyph));


// what I would like to add to the glyph's settings
vtkSMPropertyHelper(glyph,"Scale Factor").Set(1.0);
vtkSMPropertyHelper(glyph,"Scale Mode").Set(scalar);
vtkSMPropertyHelper(glyph,"Masking").Set(All_points);
...

cylinder->UpdateVTKObjects();
...


For example I tried "ScaleFactor" and "Scale Factor" but they do not 
seem to work.

what are the data types for the .Set() functions ? For example in the 
case of Masking ? Where can I find the C++ masking options and its data 
type to be used with vtkSMPropertyHelper ? Or do you suggest another way 
of accessing these properties ?

Thank you very much.

Florian

Message-ID: <398242C76E3D3740BA94E23089B34E2C85F4B969@EXCHMBX03.fed.cclrc.ac.uk>

Hi,
A post by Robert Atwood in June mentioned a problem with client server volume visualisation in PV4.1, and I have also seen problems in this case both on Linux and Windows systems.

Fixes (0014794 and 0014792) have been added to 4.2RC1 which allow correct rendering of the wavelet test case. I tried this on a Windows 7 system and works ok for 4.2RC1, but not for 4.1.

However I think that the remote/local render problem for volume visualisation is really very confusing and needs to be improved. After spending more time then I should with it, I conclude that (again on windows 7 64 bit):

(1)    Volume rendering only works if done on the remote server, not the local on (as acknowledged in a tracker ticket, though I have not seen it documented elsewhere).

(2)    For 4.1 to do this correctly for just a volume image this seems to need settings of "remote render threshold" ticked and "0 Mbytes" selected. It will work for cases when >0 Mbytes is selected, if there is also another object displayed (e.g. an isosurface). This led me to think an additional surface was always needed to see the volume, which is not the case.

(3)    For 4.2RC1 the interface to settings has changed and there is no longer a tick box. Instead the slider for remote local render size has a much greater range. This should be set to zero to force remote render for volume views. It also works for non-zero values less than the size of the volume data, e.g. 4Mbytes for a 256^3 volume. This setting did not seem work for 4.1 to force a remote rendering of just volume data.

I think it would be useful if at least the tool tips in the settings panel suggested how to make client server volume rendering work. It would also be useful if a warning message were displayed when trying (and failing) to do a local volume render in client server mode.

Another problem that has been observed is that the "smart" option for volume rendering is not necessarily that smart when the server nodes have no GPUs and the client does. This was on a Linux 64 bit system with 4.1.

Thanks,
Ron fowler

Click on the "?" button on the ParaView UI with the filter active.
That'll take you a page that will list all such "properties" available
on the filter. Additionally, you can look at these xml files[1].
Locate the proxy using the group/name and then you'll have the details
for properties on it.

Dear Utkarsh,

Thanks. That did help.
So I am having now:

...

vtkSMPropertyHelper(glyph,  "Source").Set(getSphereSource(glyph));

     //  "scalar"  =  0

     //  "vector"  =  1

     //  "vector_comp"  =  2

     //  "off"     =  3

     vtkSMPropertyHelper(glyph,  "ScaleMode",true).Set(0);

     vtkSMPropertyHelper(glyph,  "ScaleFactor",true).Set(1.0);

     //  0  or  1:  1=using  vector  property  for  orientation

     vtkSMPropertyHelper(glyph,  "Orient",true).Set(0);

     //  "All  Points"  =  0

     vtkSMPropertyHelper(glyph,  "GlyphMode",true).Set(0);


All of the above work, except the ScaleFactor setter. The scale factor 
is odd anyway: in the GUI a value of 1.8 appears by default (even though 
according to the doc it should be 1.0) . Any clue ?

Last question: How do I gain access to the GlyphSource(=SphereSource) 
object in order to use the .SetRadius(1.0) function on it ?
It is not clear to me whether it needs to be accessed through a 
vtkSMPropertyHelper or through a proxy ?


Thanks

Florian

Subject: [Paraview] Client server volume rendering problem in 4.1 and

Ron,

Those are good observations. I has been on my todo list to clean up
the remote-local rendering issue. I want ParaView to automatically
switch to remote rendering, if possible when volume rendering. I'll
see what I can do for that. The volume rendering code is currently
being revamped. I'd expect better "smart" rendering in near future.

Certain properties update their default values based on runtime data
values. This is done by what ParaView calls Domains. ScaleFactor is
one such property. To force the ScaleFactor to 1, do the change after
the "PostInialize" call.

vtkSMPropertyHelper(glyph, "Source").Set(getSphereSource(glyph));
vtkSMProxy* sphere = vtkSMPropertyHelper(glyph, "Source").GetAsProxy();
vtkSMPropertyHelper(sphere, "Radius").Set(1.0);
sphere->UpdateVTKObjects();

I had similar config problems in the DoD HPC machines I tested on. The root
cause was that the system boost was CMakefied and find boost didn't like it
but insisted on using it.

To get around it I downloaded my own boost (no need to compile it) and made
the my PV build use it by:
In cmakecache.txt
set Boost_NO_SYSTEM_PATHS:BOOL=ON
set Boost_NO_BOOST_CMAKE:BOOL=ON
Then it will ask for an respect your choice of boost headers to use.

There are some annoying and minor differences in the XDMF xml format in the
new and old versions.
For example case sensitivity and changes in treatment of default values. My
first intuition is that these are the cause.

Jean if you can provide me with a minimal example that demonstrates the
problem, I can take a deeper look.

thanks Dave. We will remember that when we do the compile after 4.2 release...

I tried xdmf3 writer using the File->Save Data option in PV v4.2.0-RC1-75-gf64ee7a and the 82M pvd file still turn into a 4.4G h5 file. Not sure if something that I am not doing right? Is there like a compression flag that I can turn on? thanks...

thanks

Looks to be a CMake-ified boost. It worked here on Fedora with 1.54.0
(which I don't believe is built using CMake anymore). It seems that it
doesn't support multiple find_package calls. Try setting
Boost_NO_BOOST_CMAKE to ON to force the FindBoost.cmake logic to kick
in.

I briefly looked at that a couple of weeks ago. Sorry I didn't get back to
you before now.

My findings were:
1) xdm3writer performs the same as xdmf2writer
2) I didn't find a compression option.

So, in other words, I don't have a quick fix and someone needs to put some
development time in to improve it.
The good news is that there is lots of room for improvement and it
shouldn't be too hard to do better on the writer end. It is very likely
that the ARL guys will have ideas of on ways to compress within libxdmf.

Ron,

Here's a fix that makes ParaView use remote-rendering irrespective of
remote-rendering threshold when volume rendering:

http://review.source.kitware.com/#/t/4672

It'd be great if you could give it a try to confirm that it works.

Thanks
Utkarsh

I briefly looked at that a couple of weeks ago. Sorry I didn't get back to you before now.

My findings were:
1) xdm3writer performs the same as xdmf2writer
2) I didn't find a compression option.

So, in other words, I don't have a quick fix and someone needs to put some development time in to improve it.
The good news is that there is lots of room for improvement and it shouldn't be too hard to do better on the writer end. It is very likely that the ARL guys will have ideas of on ways to compress within libxdmf.

I tried xdmf3 writer using the File->Save Data option in PV v4.2.0-RC1-75-gf64ee7a and the 82M pvd file still turn into a 4.4G h5 file. Not sure if something that I am not doing right? Is there like a compression flag that I can turn on? thanks...

I had similar config problems in the DoD HPC machines I tested on. The root cause was that the system boost was CMakefied and find boost didn't like it but insisted on using it.

To get around it I downloaded my own boost (no need to compile it) and made the my PV build use it by:
In cmakecache.txt
set Boost_NO_SYSTEM_PATHS:BOOL=ON
set Boost_NO_BOOST_CMAKE:BOOL=ON
Then it will ask for an respect your choice of boost headers to use.

Looks to be a CMake-ified boost. It worked here on Fedora with 1.54.0
(which I don't believe is built using CMake anymore). It seems that it
doesn't support multiple find_package calls. Try setting
Boost_NO_BOOST_CMAKE to ON to force the FindBoost.cmake logic to kick
in.

Subject: [Paraview] proper formatting of 2D data
Message-ID: <541BD3A9.6010206@energy.lth.se>

Hi,

I tried to visualize 2D structured point data when I observed a strange 
behavior. If the spacing in Y direction is negative, the data is flipped 
upside-down in 'Slice' representation mode but shown properly as a  
'Surface' representation. Tried in v. 4.0.1 and 4.2rc1 on Linux 64 bit. 
Here is a small VTK file to test:

--8<--
# vtk DataFile Version 2.0
testing
ASCII
DATASET STRUCTURED_POINTS
DIMENSIONS 3 4 1
ORIGIN 0.0 0.0 0.0
SPACING 0.5 -0.75 1.0
POINT_DATA 12
SCALARS test float
LOOKUP_TABLE default
0.0
1.0
2.0
1.0
2.0
3.0
2.0
3.0
4.0
3.0
4.0
5.0
-->8--

I am wondering if I missed something when formatting the file or if you 
have any ideas how to avoid this behavior?
Thanks,
Robert

Hi Utkarsh,
I have just downloaded the latest nightly build and it seems to work fine now (on Windows 7/64bit), doing remote volume rendering irrespective of the settings for remote/local. Many thanks for that quick fix.
Ron

Ron,

Here's a fix that makes ParaView use remote-rendering irrespective of remote-rendering threshold when volume rendering:

http://review.source.kitware.com/#/t/4672

It'd be great if you could give it a try to confirm that it works.

Thanks
Utkarsh

Subject: [Paraview] 3D contour smoothness
Message-ID: <541C3CBC.9080302@googlemail.com>

Hello everyone,

after extensive search I was desperate enough to post on this list:

It appears that the surface smoothing algorithm of the contour filter
does not work as "aggressive" as in older version (3.14.1 was the last
one we found to do so). As an example I prepared this two screenshots,
VTK data are scalars on a structured grid (200x100x100), legacy format.
(An additional call of the "smooth" filter does not help.)

3.14.1
http://s7.directupload.net/images/140919/euadfvko.png
4.0.RC1
http://s14.directupload.net/images/140919/84y689mi.png

Both versions are running with the shipped settings. Since the effect
could be reproduced on several workstations, we are wondering whether
there has been an (undocumented?) change in the filter mechanism or some
option we/setting/data problem we are not aware of.

Kind regards and thanks in advance
Philipp Engels.

Philipp,

In the contour filter, is the option "Compute Normals" checked in 4.0 RC1?

Also, are the contour values the same between the two versions?

Thanks,
Cory

Hi Kazuyoshi,

The fix has been merged into the main branch of ParaView and should be
available in nightly builds as of today.

Hi Cory,

thank you for your fast feedback.

a) Compute normal is checked. (Without normals, the contour is
completely stepped)
b) Contour values are the same.

Philipp

Philipp,

I can confirm what you see with a pre 4.2 version of ParaView.
However, the number of produced cells is the same.

I will try to track down why this changed.

Thanks,
Cory

Hi Robert,

Good one! The slice rep uses GPU textures and this behavior looks a bug 
in the logic that sets up the texture. You should file a bug report.

There's an easy workaround. Convert to a positive spacing and adjust the 
origin accordinigly. The data will the occupy the same region. Here's 
how your file looks then:

--8<--
# vtk DataFile Version 2.0
testing
ASCII
DATASET STRUCTURED_POINTS
DIMENSIONS 3 4 1
ORIGIN 0.0 -2.25 0.0
SPACING 0.5 0.75 1.0
POINT_DATA 12
SCALARS test float
LOOKUP_TABLE default
0.0
1.0
2.0
1.0
2.0
3.0
2.0
3.0
4.0
3.0
4.0
5.0
-->8--

Robert,
I am pretty sure that is a bug.  Mind writing up a bug report?  Also, your description and example file are great.  Be sure to include them in the bug.

Hi,

I tried to visualize 2D structured point data when I observed a strange behavior. If the spacing in Y direction is negative, the data is flipped upside-down in 'Slice' representation mode but shown properly as a 'Surface' representation. Tried in v. 4.0.1 and 4.2rc1 on Linux 64 bit. 
Here is a small VTK file to test:

--8<--
# vtk DataFile Version 2.0
testing
ASCII
DATASET STRUCTURED_POINTS
DIMENSIONS 3 4 1
ORIGIN 0.0 0.0 0.0
SPACING 0.5 -0.75 1.0

2.0
1.0
2.0
3.0
2.0
3.0
4.0

5.0

I am wondering if I missed something when formatting the file or if you have any ideas how to avoid this behavior?
Thanks,
Robert

Is negative spacing really supported in VTK/ParaView? The VTK File
Formats document for legacy data
(http://www.vtk.org/VTK/img/file-formats.pdf) states under the
description of the structured points data:

"The data spacing sx, sy, sz must be greater than 0."

This is apparently not enforced in the reader, however.

Thanks,
Cory

We use this simple python script for file series (stl, vtk, particle data in LAMMPS text- or binary format (with our own reader)).
Feel free to use this as a starting point:
https://github.com/richti83/ParaView_Reader_for_LIGGGHTS/blob/master/python_macros/update.py

The if-condition in line 68 should be more generous, but for now it works and you can add every source (plane,line,...) there which does not support file series.

To use it: first build your tree in the pipeline browser by opening file series (need to have more than one file bc. otherwise the reader_core is used inside PV instead of PV_FileSeriesReader).
Than, while the simulation is running, just hit update macro button to reload the file series and jump to the last available timestep.

Best,
Christian.

Sorry, didn't get around to it yet. Over this weekend is more likely,
since I am tracking down some last minute issues with 4.2 right now.

Message-ID: <CAL_eiiQTW_qu2KdKPDa4qWBOFh6jtkF6__xeCZGZ-FiC=7B+ug@mail.gmail.com>

I am outputting my data from Nek5000 in the case.fld* format. I am creating
a case.nek5000 file which reads like:
====
filetemplate:        case.fld%02d
firsttimestep: 1
numtimesteps: 2
====

When I am opening this *nek5000 file in Paraview 4.1, I don't see the
contours. In Visit I see them (images attached). Any tips?

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [Paraview] Plotting Nek5000 output data

I am outputting my data from Nek5000 in the case.fld* format. I am creating a case.nek5000 file which reads like:
====
filetemplate:        case.fld%02d
firsttimestep: 1
numtimesteps: 2
====

When I am opening this *nek5000 file in Paraview 4.1, I don't see the contours. In Visit I see them (images attached). Any tips?

Subject: [Paraview] Odd behavior of XDMF files with 3DCORECTMesh
Message-ID: <541D674F.2020208@gmail.com>

Hi,

I lately started to write my data in HDF5/XDMF files. This works so far
very well for unstructured data using TopologyType="Mixed" and Polygon
cells, but I have some trouble with structured grids.

I attached a very simple VTK file, which is correctly visualized in
ParaView. More precisely, the DIMENSIONS keyword specifies the
dimensions in X Y Z direction and the SPACING and POINT_DATA keywords
are specified accordingly.

Opening the VTK file in ParaView and exporting the data as XDMF leads to
an XDMF file with dimensions and the spacing is in reverse order (Z Y
X), where seemingly the data is written in the same order as in the VTK
file.
Is this intended or a bug?
Just to note, the data from the ParaView-created XDMF and the original
VTK file are displayed consistently.

When I however manually converter the VTK to a XDMF file with
dimensions, spacing and data specified as in the VTK file, I get a
completely wrong representation in ParaView.
Seemingly, in the "Topology" element the "Dimensions" keyword specifies
the dimensions in Z Y X direction, which I thing is rather odd.
The whole thing gets then completely messed up when specifying the data.

Am I doing something wrong when manually creating the XDMF file or is
this a bug?

Best regards,
Armin

Matthias,

Attached is the Python script that reloads a file-series. You can
import this as a macro or just run it from the Python shell. In either
case, ensure that the reader to reload is the active reader.

Dear Shawn,

Thanks for your fix!  Confirmed on the following environments
that ParaView does NOT seg.faults when it reads VRML file again :

* windows ("4.2.0-RC1-105-g58ab368 32-bit", nightly-build binary )
* linux ("4.2.0-RC1-120-g2ea0acd 32-bit", built by myself from
         git master which includes commits upto
            2ea0acdeb5062ecff9b6e56a26b72c66dd0eb69d
            at Sat Sep 20 09:15:03 2014 -0400

Thanks again.

By default, ParaView draws cells, not points. (You've found one exception
where
selected points are drawn.) If you want to see points in general, you will
need
to create "vertex" cells. One way to do that is to run your data through the
glyph filter and select the "2D Glyph" and then "Vected" glyph types.

etc.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

I run Delaunay 3D on my cloud. I exported into a vtk file.

Reimported.

Only point on cube faces are displayed, no one inside


Any hint?

Thank you Burlen, I just filed a bug report this morning. I will also 
adjust the export routines to avoid negative spacings for the time being.

Hi Flavio,

I use the POLYDATA format to save the data and then visualize it with 
glyphs (usually spheres, but if you just need points I suppose small 
cubes would work as well). The header looks like:

--8<--

Hi Utkarsh,

thank you for the Python script.
Having never used Python scripts in ParaView before, I have difficulties to run it. When I open the Python shell and try to launch the script with the "Run Script" button, I get an error message saying:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 19, in <module>
NameError: name 'GetActiveSource' is not defined

I use ParaView 4.0.1 under Windows 7. I have added the lib directory of ParaView to my path, as it says in the ParaView Python documentation. Is there anything else I need to do to run the script?

When I load it as a macro, the corresponding button appears, but when I click on it, nothing seems to happen. I have tested it with a pvd time collection where I have commented out the last timestep. When I loaded it, all timesteps but the last one were visible. Then I removed the comment marks around in the last timestep in the pvd file and lauched the Refresh Reader macro. I would expect that now the last timestep in the pvd would be visible, but it wasn't.

You said that the reader to reload should be the active reader. How do I see which reader is the active one? The pvd collection was highlighted when I activated the macro. Do I have to do something else?

Thanks,

Matthias

Can you try the script with 4.2-RC before we try debugging this?

I have tested it with a pvd time collection where I have commented out the last timestep. When I loaded it, all timesteps but the last one were visible. Then I removed the comment marks around in the last timestep in the pvd file and lauched the Refresh Reader macro. I would expect that now the last timestep in the pvd would be visible, but it wasn't.

File "<string>", line 61, in <module>
RuntimeError: Failed to locate the file listing.

Could this just be a matter of representation? From the images it looks like in VisIt you are using the pseudocolor filter, which is just a surface representation colored by some scalar field (x_velocity, it looks like).  In ParaView, you are applying the contour filter with a single value, and displaying the surface representation of that.  I can't tell from the snapshot, but I am guessing that the representation of the square_nek5000 data set is set to outline, or possibly wireframe.  If that is the case, try changing that to surface representation.  You may then need to change the colorby selection to be x_velocity, if that is the variable you are interested in.

Hope that helps,
joe

When I am opening this *nek5000 file in Paraview 4.1, I don't see the contours. In Visit I see them (images attached). Any tips?

Hi Utkarsh,

I tested it for a series of vtu files, and indeed it works with the 4.2 RC (not with 4.0.1). Also there is no error message on the Python console any more.
Thank you!
Now I can at least follow the simulation going on by loading the vtu series.

Would it be possible to make it work also for a pvd...? :)

Thanks,

Matthias

Subject: [Paraview] announce: VTK and ParaView scripting training October 21
 at Kitware's North Carolina office
Message-ID: <CANjZAi__i+3mCDxEJXF=WGRr-XVX3RViufqscfCWvoAmpeKJAQ@mail.gmail.com>

Kitware is hosting a VTK-ParaView training course in Carrboro, NC. The
course will be held on October 21, 2014. Attendees will gain practical
experience in both ParaView, a scalable application for general purpose
scientific visualization, and The Visualization Toolkit (VTK), the
underlying open-source library from which ParaView is built.

The training mixes theory and application to guide attendees through a set
of exercises, which are all given in the python programming language. Upon
completion of this course, attendees will not only know how to use ParaView
and VTK, but they will also know how to extend ParaView at run time, use it
in concert with other Python capable applications, and run it in batch
processing HPC contexts. Additional details and registration information
are available on the Kitware website <http://training.kitware.fr/browse/73>.

The price of the course via early registration is $650. Early registration
is available through October 8, 2014. The price of the course via regular
registration is $815.

In addition, Kitware will be hosting a ?Project Lifecycle Management with
the CMake Family of Tools? training course on October 20, 2014. This course
will also be hosted in Carrboro. For more information, please visit

Subject: [Paraview] useful plugin: how to do it, really?
Message-ID: <54208CA1.7050907@xs4all.nl>

Dear Paraview people,

I am investigating the option to use Paraview as the base platform for a
simulation project that we are currently working on.
Paraview's visualisation capabilities, as well as the (alleged)
extensibility (by writing plugins) suggest that this is the case indeed.

In order to get a better feeling of this, I want to try a small example
showing me how this all works.
However, I get lost in the documentation and code tree. Browsing the web
for information on writing a paraview plugin typically refer to
Paraview's web pages, but
I must admit that the are not really helpful, despite the amount of
words devoted to the topic.
I wonder if there is somebody who can help me, or point me to useful
information.

As a sample problem, this is what I would like to do:

1. Suppose I have created, interactively, a box, a sphere and a cone,
using the corresponding entries in the "Sources" menu.

2. Now I would like to *programmatically* (i.e. in  a c++ plugin) loop
over the sources (here: the box, sphere and cone) and for each of the
elements
get hold of the parameters that were used to define these sources (i.e.
the box dimensions, center, radii etc.). With these parameters I can
then do other things to build my own extension, but those details do not
matter here.

I have looked into the examples, but I really do not recognise in any of
them what I'm supposed to do.
Maybe it is there, but I find the code tree of such a complexity that I
have problems in finding what I need.

Your help is greatly appreciated.

Kind Regards,
Bertwim

Bertwim,

I agree the developer docs are little scattered right now. My plan is
to start writing blog posts that make this easier to digest. One of
these, hopefully, I get around to it :). In the mean time, my replies
are inline.

Several ways for getting to the "proxies" for the sphere, box, etc.
created. One way it using the vtkSMSessionProxyManager.

a. Using vtkSMSessionProxyManager:
a.1 Get access to the active session's proxy manager using
pqActiveObjects::instance().proxyManager() [1]
a.2 Use vtkSMProxyIterator[2] to iterate over the "sources" group.
    vtkNew<vtkSMProxyIterator> iter;
    iter->SetSessionProxyManager(pqActiveObjects::instance().proxyManager());
    iter->SetModeToOneGroup();
    for (iter->Begin("sources"); ! iter->IsAtEndt(); iter->Next())
      {
      iter->GetKey() ---> is the "label" for the proxy you see in the
pipeline browser
      iter->GetProxy() -- > will be the actual proxy object,
      }

To access parameters defined on them, you can access the "properties"
on these proxies. If you know which property you're looking for using
vtkSMPropertyHelper[3] to get the values e.g.

   sphereProxy = ..
   vtkSMPropertyHelper(sphereProxy, "Radius").GetAsDouble() --> the radius

To iterate over all properties on the proxy, you can use
vtkSMProxy::NewPropertyIterator [4] which will give you a new iterator
(don't forget to call iter->Delete() once you're done with the
iterator). You can use that to iterate over all properties on the
proxy,

Hope that helps,
Utkarsh

Hello Utkarsh.

Thanks for your response. I will need some time to digest and practice, but
I will follow-up on your suggestions.

Kind Regards,

Caveats: NONE

Hello,

I am trying to get a ParaView  + vrpn running on a zSpace. With zSpace VRPN
server only available on Windows, here goes the following...

I am able to get ParaView build with ninja when I only do
-DPARAVIEW_USE_MPI:BOOL=ON and the binary appears to be working. But when I
included 
-DPARAVIEW_ENABLE_PYTHON:BOOL=ON
I have linking problem. How do you make sure that I have a working Python
library? Dumpbin is reporting python is x64 library and I am trying to
compile a x64 ParaView.

I am getting some 26 unresolved externals when ninja is "Creating library
lib\vtkPythonInterpreter-pv4.2.lib and object
lib\vtkPythonInterpreter-pv4.2.exp." and some 123 unresolved externals when
ninja is "Creating library lib\vtkWrappingPython27Core-pv4.2.lib and object
lib\vtkWrappingPython27Core-pv4.2.exp"- included at the end of this email.

The odd thing is, both failed command has python27.lib library in it

Do I have to included another python library? If so, what would that be?


I am building a 64bit version of ParaView on Windows 7 using 
1. VS2013 express version
2. Python-2.7.3 - release version build with cmake + ninja
(https://github.com/davidsansome/python-cmake-buildsystem)

-DZLIB_INCLUDE_DIR=C:\tools\zlib\zlib-1.2.8\include \
..\python-cmake-buildsystem -G Ninja \
ninja
ninja install

3. Ninja-1.5.1 - build using the python-2.7.3 above so, python appears to
work
python bootstrap.py --x64

4. ParaView-v4.2.0-RC1-128-gc89b0ad

git clone git://paraview.org/ParaView.git
cd ParaView
git pull
git submodule update --init

Simon,

As this states [1], superbuild on Windows with Python is only
supported for VS 2008 currently. We will soon add support for VS2013.
If you want to use VS2013, using USE_SYSTEM_python=ON may be worth a
try, but these was a discussion on the mailing list a little while ago
that too may have problems -- but it wasn't clear if it was build
problem, or an environment issue. Worth a shot, however.

Caveats: NONE

Utkarsh,

Thanks for the info. I did followed that thread and my conclusion at the end 
was ParaView for windows compiled for vs2012 :) so, I went a step further to 
try to get compiled with vs2013Express since that's the compiler I have access 
to on windows ;) I thought getting python compiled on any of the compiler of 
choice is the prerequisite...  apparently  I still don't have python working 
even after I manage to compile it. :(

I am not doing the superbuild and just ParaView git from source build. I ran 
into too many errors with VS2013Express +  ninja-1.5.1 with the superbuild 
route that I don't even know where/how to begin to ask for help.

I will give -DUSE_SYSTEM_PYTHON=ON flag a try. If that doesn't work, I will 
have my justification to ask for VS2008 purchased/installed on my system.

Thanks for your help.

Thanks
-simon

Simon,

As this states [1], superbuild on Windows with Python is only
supported for VS 2008 currently. We will soon add support for VS2013.
If you want to use VS2013, using USE_SYSTEM_python=ON may be worth a
try, but these was a discussion on the mailing list a little while ago
that too may have problems -- but it wasn't clear if it was build
problem, or an environment issue. Worth a shot, however.

Ah, okay, sorry I missed the part that you were not using the
Superbuild. The DUSE_SYSTEM_PYTHON is only for Superbuilds, so it
won't matter for your regular ParaView build.

My first pass at building ParaView with VS2013 (ParaView not
ParaViewSuperbuild) exposed a few issues which I addressed. I can't
remember if I built with Python support enabled, however. I'll check
that once I am home (since it was on my home machine).

Ben, we should have  VS2013 dashboard setup on Miranda soon. That'll
be the first step before we move to supporting superbuilds with VS2013
too.

Simon, I suggest give us a few days to track this own, unless you're
feeling adventurous :).

Utkarsh,

Awesome! I can certainly wait for a few days on linking error with ParaView 
build with -DPARAVIEW_ENABLE_PYTHON:BOOL=ON . I think I am running out of 
ideas to try on how to get around that :)

At the mean time, I can work on getting VRPN setup with ParaView I compiled 
with just -DPARAVIEW_USE_MPI:BOOL=ON

Thanks Utkarsh and Ben for your help.

Thanks
-simon

Ah, okay, sorry I missed the part that you were not using the
Superbuild. The DUSE_SYSTEM_PYTHON is only for Superbuilds, so it
won't matter for your regular ParaView build.

My first pass at building ParaView with VS2013 (ParaView not
ParaViewSuperbuild) exposed a few issues which I addressed. I can't
remember if I built with Python support enabled, however. I'll check
that once I am home (since it was on my home machine).

Ben, we should have  VS2013 dashboard setup on Miranda soon. That'll
be the first step before we move to supporting superbuilds with VS2013
too.

Simon, I suggest give us a few days to track this own, unless you're
feeling adventurous :).

When deployment by using the (

Subject: [Paraview] How to create streamlines from tecplot velocity data
Message-ID: <542263F8.5000001@gmail.com>

Dear All,

I have tecplot velocity dataset that I want to view with Paraview. I can 
successfully import the data to paraview, but neither 'cell data to 
point data' nor 'stream tracer' button is available (grey). The data set 
is in ascii format as shown below. The source data is also attached.

Would anybody please give me some tips? I am a new to paraview and only 
have basic knowledge of it.

Thanks,

Danyang

Subject: [Paraview] Help: cannot run paraview
Message-ID: <5422BD88.9010900@gmail.com>

Dear all,

I got some problem when running paraview in terminal (under Linux mint).

The terminal shows something wrong as follow,and I cannot see the 
paraview window.

Do you have any ideals of what's going on? Reinstallation using Synaptic 
Package Manager does not do any help.

Thank you

Hi Sukhachev,

The one thing that might not be explicit about the ubuntu_14_04 guide might
be that the script "/data/pvw/bin/start.sh" should be launched with a
DISPLAY setup.
Otherwise, you will have to be more explicit on what you've done and what
is not working. The log files usually helps to see what was skipped from
the documentation.

Moreover, the documentation that get's updated automatically can be found
at the following address. (Which might be more accurate.)

http://www.paraview.org/ParaView3/Doc/Nightly/www/js-doc/index.html

This is the one you find when you go on paraview.org and go to the
documentation section.

Utkarth,

I followed-up on your advice, and it works. Thanks very much!

I have still one question:  When iterating over the proxy objects, I
need to find out what kind of object the proxy is referring to (Sphere,
box, etc.)
In my trial code, I do that via the "XMLName" followed by a string
comparison, like this:

         // prx is proxy, obtained as you describe via iter->GetProxy()

         std::string srctype = prx->GetXMLName();

         if ( srctype == "SphereSource" )
         {
            // Code for sphere
        }
         else if ( srctype == "CylinderSource" )
         {
            // Code for Cyliner
         }
         else // etc
         {
            ...;
         }
 
Is this indeed the way to do it, or are there (more efficient)
alternatives?

Kind Regards,
Bertwim

That's pretty much what you have to do, I'm afraid.

Subject: [Paraview] How to compile a new file???
Message-ID: <54232479.7060603@xs4all.nl>

Hello,

I'm trying to understand how ParaView's build system determines which
files are to be compiled. The problem I encounter is that newly added
files are not being picked-up by the makefiles. My guess is this must be
something simple, but so far my attempts yield no result.

This is what I do:
Let's assume I'm working on a plugin, the code of which residing in 
<path_to_paraview>/ParaView/Examples/Plugins/<my_plugin_dir>
The build directory is in <path_to_paraview>/ParaView/build.

The plugin directory <my_plugin_dir> was obtained by copying and
renaming the example plugin named "SourceToolbar".
After that I did, in the build directory, a ccmake ..; So far, so good. 
Changes made in a source file (not in the build directory) are seen by
make (when done in the build directory).

However, when I add a new source file (<file>.cxx), I can't get
make/cmake to add this sourcefile to the build.
How is this supposed to work?

Any help greatly appreciated.


Kind Regards,
Bertwim

Add the new file's name to the CMakeLists.txt file in its source directory.

</div>Ah,  now I see. The macro ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN has as one of its argument a SOURCES keyword. Adding to list indeed helps. Thanks for the hint.

Subject: [Paraview] Exporting to PDF from Python

Hi,

I have a scene in Paraview 4.1 that I'd like to export to a PDF from a Python script.  Ideally I'd like to be able to use the GL2PSExporter and set options there (such as "Cull Hidden Primitives") like I do in the PV GUI (under File->Export Scene).  I've looked online and seen that I can export to a PDF via WriteImage("test.pdf",Writer="vtkPostScriptWriter"), but this doesn't offer me any of the flexibility I have when exporting from the GUI.

Can someone recommend a way to export a PV view to PDF from Python that gives me the options of GL2PS?  Any suggestions are greatly appreciated - thanks very much!

Best,

David

Message-ID: <916060444.7641189.1411592740080.JavaMail.zimbra@stanford.edu>

Hi,

I have some VTK files (legacy VTK format, unstructured grid) that I'm rendering in Paraview.  For each file, I load the file into Paraview, then do a scalar clip of that data.  I render only the clip for each file.

The thing is that doing this for a large number of files uses up a lot of memory.  Each LegacyVTKReader uses about 30MB of RAM, and each clip uses only about 0.15MB of RAM.  If I just kept the Clips in memory and could discard each LegacyVTKReader as soon as I made the corresponding clip, there's clearly a lot of memory that could be saved.

This may be a silly question, but is there any way to "separate" a Clip from its parent data set?  Like, can I just make the Clip its own (3D) geometric object, and forget about the fact that it originally came from a VTK file?  Maybe this is impossible, but I thought I would ask in case there is some way to achieve what I'm thinking of and save a great deal of memory.

Thanks very much!

David

Hi, Sebastien

Thank you.
I just took advantage of this documentation and to deploy.
I ran the script /data/pvw/bin/start.sh.
But when entering the address: http://localhost/apps/Visualizer is only
displayed only the green bar at the top of the window, and nothing more.
That in this case?

Sincerely,
Sukhachev Ilya!

Hi,

I'm facing the same problem and would be quite interested in a solution as
well. I'm loading pvd files, however the number of linked vtu files is not
varying in my case. Just the content of the existing files changes.
Something like a reload button or context menu entry in a future release
would be perfect.

The top bar is not green anymore. Try to replace the directory /lib, /apps,
/ext within the ParaView /www inside the directory you serve with Apache.
Moreover, can you enable the development tools on your browser to see what
kind of error you got?

Did you look also at the different types of logs? Apache, Launcher (see
config to know where you choose to put them).
That could also give you an idea on what went wrong.

Subject: [Paraview] using calculator filter on a table?
Message-ID: <8D5C1B82EA40014E8B222E92B9076325021358774366@MAILBOX.LASP.colorado.edu>

Hello all,

Is there a way to use the Calculator filter on a table?

My reader loads a bunch of auxiliary files that loads time-series information for a specific point (at a higher temporal resolution than the 3D model output).  I need to be able to convert the units in the time series information with some simple calculations so that I can match the units of the remainder of my work.

Is there a way to use the calculator filter to do this? It is greyed out when I have the table selected...  Are there some other steps I need to do to make it work?

Thanks,
Josh

For now, with 4.2 RC1, stick to using "Programmable Filter" with
"Script" as follows:

expr = inputs[0].RowData["RTData"] * 2.0
output.RowData.append(expr, "result")

If you can add a bug to the bug tracker for this, that'd be great too.

Thanks
Utkarsh

With ParaView 4.2-RC, you can use the Python trace to generate the
script to use for exporting. It looks something like so:

ExportView('/tmp/sample.pdf', view=renderView1, Plottitle='MyPlot',
    Compressoutputfile=1,
    Linewidthscalingfactor=1.0,
    Pointsizescalingfactor=1.0)

For 4.1, look at the implementation of "ExportView" in [1]. You can
use a similar code for the same effect.

Ideally I'd like to be able to use the GL2PSExporter and set options there (such as "Cull Hidden Primitives") like I do in the PV GUI (under File->Export Scene).  I've looked online and seen that I can export to a PDF via WriteImage("test.pdf",Writer="vtkPostScriptWriter"), but this doesn't offer me any of the flexibility I have when exporting from the GUI.

I have a few questions regarding the server configuration of the remote visualization framework. For instance,I have two render nodes at Location A and four render nodes at Location B, all nodes can access a copy of a dataset.


1. Can I connect to multiple servers that the same time?

For example:

connection1 =Connect('ip1',11111)

connection1 =Connect('ip2',11111)

##some render codes

Disconnect()


2. If I can connect to multiple servers at the same time, can the client access all nodes and visualize the dataset in parallel at the same time?  That is, nodes at Location A render a portion of the data and nodes at Location B render the rest part of the data. Do I need to split the dataset?


3. If I can not visualize the same data with servers at different locations, what is the best approach to utilize all nodes at different locations in parallel?


Thanks in advance.

Jing

Hi Utkarsh,

I am trying to get this to work.  I am trying it on 4.1 currently, as I have not yet compiled against 4.2.

When I try the code you gave me I get a segfault.

I wasn't expecting it to work first try (as all I did was copy/paste and change the variable name to one in the table), but I didn't expect the segfault.

The failure may be related to the fact that my table is a member of a multi-block... how do I address the specific block from the programmable filter? 

if you can advise, that would be great.

-Josh

For now, with 4.2 RC1, stick to using "Programmable Filter" with
"Script" as follows:

expr = inputs[0].RowData["RTData"] * 2.0
output.RowData.append(expr, "result")

If you can add a bug to the bug tracker for this, that'd be great too.

Thanks

Subject: [Paraview] question about geometry caching
Message-ID: <CAHrmR1WtvU9xTiz1vxz_SJeo97P20neSgYk0cHb72_UhNR2QFA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all:

       I have found a problem with geometry caching starting from version
higher than the Paraview 4.1.

In Paraview 4.1, this function work well.  What I am trying to do is like
this:
1. To display the deformation of a sequence of mesh model (*vtk files)
under 20 time points.
2. In version 4.1, when the mesh sequence is opened, I can select
 edit->setting->animation->Cache Limit (in KBs) and set the value to be
very big, e.g. 51024000.
    Then when I click the play and loop toolbar button, after 1 or 2
cycles, the mesh will be displayed very smoothly.

However, in the Paraview4.1+ version,
1. In the setting menu, I can not find the animation directly.  In the
General tab, I tried to search "cache" in the blank,
and I can see the animation again.
2.  But when I still set it to the large value like mentioned above,  the
cache does not work.

I would like to know if there is a solution for this?  and did I set it
correct to use cache function?
Hope anybody can give me a quick solution.
Thank you very much.

regards,
Alex

Message-ID: <8D5C1B82EA40014E8B222E92B9076325021358774369@MAILBOX.LASP.colorado.edu>

Hi all,

I am adding features to my custom reader, and I need some help.

My reader does the following:
1) Reads the main time-dependent model data
2) Reads 0 or more non model-time dependent files that provide time series information specific points at high temporal resolution.

Currently, I am reading the main model data as a structured grid on Port 0 and the time series files into a multi-block table on port 1.

This works great, as far as it goes, but I cannot figure out how to access any of the port 1 information from within Python.  Everytime I try to fetch data for the source, I get a vtkStructuredGrid structure, with no sign of the multi-block tables.

Can someone give me some advice on how to go about accessing the port1 data from within python?

Thanks,
Josh

Subject: [Paraview] 3d scatterplot
Message-ID: <1411683955.18053.YahooMailNeo@web120003.mail.ne1.yahoo.com>

Hi everyone.
I am trying to make a 3D Scatterplot from a principal component analysis data.
Above I present the general format of my cvs table:

type,PC 1,PC 2,PC 3
s35,-1.1678,-0.81478,0.61832
s35,-0.54306,-0.52355,0.4743
s35,-1.4862,-0.67112,0.24996
s35,-1.5646,-0.43992,0.37869
s35,-3.6895,-0.3267,-0.90597
s35,-3.2705,-0.34452,-0.47978
s35,1.5185,-0.53932,0.57408
Bacillus,0.5931,0.25691,-0.47788
Bacillus,0.67359,-0.012615,-0.29663
Bacillus,0.80718,0.13031,-0.34567
Bacillus,1.0766,-0.052194,-0.36311
Bacillus,1.6975,-0.11165,-0.15835
Bacillus,0.44962,0.2936,-0.42939
Bacillus,1.3748,-0.0011358,-0.36139

Here is what I tried so far:
I loaded the table and activated the filter "Table to points". For each axis (XYZ), I attributed a PC column ( X=PC1, Y=PC2 and Z=PC3). After clicking in "Split horizontal" and "3D view", I got a 3D scatterplot.
The problem is that I can't color the points based on the variable "type". In properties,  In the color scale editor I attributed each value ("type") to a color, but it is not dysplayed in the scatterplot.
Do you know what can I do?

Thanks in advance.

Josh,

I had a similar issue a while back, where I had a custom reader with multiple outputs.  In order to get access to output port 1 I ended up doing something along the lines of:

fooFilter = servermanager.OutputPort(my_reader, 1)
SetActiveSource(fooFilter)
fooFilter.UpdatePipeline()  # may not be required

# to see the names of the point data arrays on this output port
dataInfo = fooFilter.GetDataInformation()
pointDataInfo = dataInfo.getPointDataInformation()
numArrays = pointDataInfo.GetNumberOfArrays()
for foo in range(numArrays):
    aName = pointDataInfo.GetArrayInformation(foo)
    print "name (", foo, "): ", aName


(thanks to Utkarsh, who pointed me in the right direction when I was originally trying to do this)

Hope this helps,
joe

Dear group,

I hope I will be able to find an answer to my problem here.

I am not sure I understand how the interpolation works. I have generated a
VTK file (attached) and I am trying to visualizing it in Paraview. The data
represent the solar radiation on the ground around various buildings.

My algorithm calculates the radiation in each node of a constrained
delauney triangulation. The plan is to visualize this in paraview to have a
nice smooth fillled contour.

The image I get though, does not make sense to me; it seems that paraview
is interpolating only within the triangles and not in the x,y directions.
Am I missing something?

Thanks a lot for any help
Ruggiero

thank you, ok. try to understand. I put the stable version and not the
release candidate.

But there are a few more questions.
Do files are responsible for localization? I need to replace the language in
the design parawiewweb.
And the second. Is there a possibility of the file from which the object is
loaded into the web, continuously read the data? That is to update the
image in the browser loading new data, but this is not in the manual and
automatic.

Sincerely,
Sukhachev Ilya!

ParaView currently only supports coloring with numerical values. I'd
suggest adding another row to the CSV to map the "type" to integers
and then use categorical colors [1] to label the colors appropriately.

ParaView 4.2 has been released, so that would be the latest stable version
available.
There is no localization per say but the filter names could be customized
the way you want.

For continuous live visualization it is possible but that will be a custom
development. And for that you can contact Kitware for either a support
contract (http://www.kitware.com/products/support.html) or an end-product
development (http://www.kitware.com/products/consulting.html).

Hi Paraview Users, developers or wiki-maintainers (whoever that is),

not sure, who's editing the paraview-wiki, but I think, I came across a 
problematic statement on the OSMesa-page:

here
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/ParaView_And_Mesa_3D
in chapter "Configuring ParaView for use with OSMesa" it says:
...
-DOPENGL_gl_LIBRARY=\"\" \
...
but here
http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2013-November/029961.html
it says, that you should avoid empty quotes in this variable. I 
experienced similar problems and i think
...
-DOPENGL_gl_LIBRARY= \
...
finally fixed it. You might want to correct or mention this issue in the 
wiki.

Regards!

Message-ID: <D04AD9EB.1C124%kmorel@sandia.gov>

Yes, ParaView will use the triangles to interpolate values between points. The interpolation you are getting is exactly as I would expect based on your data and topology. I'm not sure what you mean by "not [interpolating] in the x,y directions". The triangles are in the x-y plane and interpolation is happening in this x-y plane.

Moving into guesswork, I am imagining that you are expecting a smooth  and fairly straight contour at some distance from the buildings. The reason you don't see this is due to the representation in your data. I notice that your data contains only two values for "RadiationOnPerson." The value is either 0 or 205.7. Presumably there is some contour in space where this field discontinuously transitions from 0 to 205.7, but there is no way to accurately predict where that is from the data you are providing. Instead, ParaView is just linearly interpolating between these values, which is wrong but probably the best you can do with the data provided. The problem is made even worse by the irregular sampling of the field.

Dear group,

I hope I will be able to find an answer to my problem here.

I am not sure I understand how the interpolation works. I have generated a VTK file (attached) and I am trying to visualizing it in Paraview. The data represent the solar radiation on the ground around various buildings.

My algorithm calculates the radiation in each node of a constrained delauney triangulation. The plan is to visualize this in paraview to have a nice smooth fillled contour.

The image I get though, does not make sense to me; it seems that paraview is interpolating only within the triangles and not in the x,y directions. Am I missing something?

Thanks a lot for any help
Ruggiero

Dear All

I am trying to visualise a series of VTK files using pvbatch and I get an error.

I write VTK files with a header as ascii, and then data as a 32 bit int binary. I can visualise individual files. As there are many files, I would like to automate this process. To do so, I produce a pvsm file using ParaView interactively. To loop over the pvsm, I have constructed the following python script:

from paraview.simple import *
servermanager.LoadState("kuntest.pvsm")
SetActiveView(GetRenderView())
for i in range(1,40, 3):
    print 'h%04d.vtk' % (i)
    FindSource("h0001.vtk").FileNames ='h%04d.vtk' % (i)
    WriteImage('h_%06d.png' % (i))

When I try to run the visualisation simulation by the command, I get an error that I do not understand:

h0001.vtk
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "crn3d_color_sync_frames.py", line 7, in <module>
    FindSource("h0001.vtk").FileNames ='h%04d.vtk' % (i)
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'FileNames'

Can you comment?

thanks
Sanjay

Means that FindSource("h0001.vtk") returned none.

Do a print GetSources() to see what it might be instead of "h0001.vtk".

Hi Gerrit,

The code on the Wiki has been tested with PV 4.0.0, but it sounds like 
it no longer works. The issue is that if you do not put *something in 
the GL library then CMake will fill it in with the system libGL. That is 
the wrong thing to do when using OSMesa and can lead to run time issues 
if you don't set LD_LIBRARY_PATH. In recent builds I've been putting 
libOSMesa in place of the empty string and that has worked. We can 
update the Wiki, however the real solution will be to remove linking of 
libGL and X11 libraries when using OSMesa.

Hi

I just worked out what the problem was.

One file should be used to set up the pvsm and not the complete data set.

cheers

Message-ID: <B7454A56-0253-4C76-8D42-C9A325BBE64A@nvidia.com>

Greetings

There are two points that I would like to bring up.

1) Firstly, in Paraview 4/4.1, the accessing the attribute (servermanager.)fromGUI causing problems for me.

https://github.com/Kitware/ParaView/blob/master/Wrapping/Python/paraview/benchmark.py

In def __render(?), the attribute fromGUI is not part of server manager (replace with paraview.fromGUI to make it work).

>>> from paraview import benchmark

  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/paraview/benchmark.py", line 592, in __render
    if not servermanager.fromGUI:
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'fromGUI'


2) Secondly, the number of polygons maxes out to 2 million taking about 90 MB. Is there a flag to change the max buffer size? 

I would like to run a bigger problem running more number of polygons. I am running on an NVIDIA GTX Titan. 

Thanks
Praveen

Thanks Ken.

Got it. It makes sense. It seems that the only way to improve the quality
is to have a finer grid and a more detailed calculation of the amount of
radiation (the previous image included only the direct). New images are at
this link

https://www.dropbox.com/s/z9m2nr7ybj5mqqp/finermesh.zip?dl=0

I was wondering whether there was a way to at least smooth the results (see
other attached image). I have looked at the filters available, but there is
no such thing. When I import these results onto StarCCM I definitely see a
smoother interpolation.

Thanks
Ruggiero

	 print self.GetInputDataObject(0,i).GetNumberOfPoints()
##

I am able to use the xml format to define multiple inputs in a cleaner way, but can not access the input data (example below). 
Changing "command" value does not help. 
How should I be accessing the inputs available from the xml setup? 

Thanks for the help,
Fraser

Subject: [Paraview] HOWto create / extend sources?
Message-ID: <5426BC2D.7000505@xs4all.nl>

Hello,

I just can;'t figure out how how to do the following in Paraview
(programmatically, that is. I'm writing a new C++plugin). I found
description/examples of how to create youre own reader, writer, filter.
But what about a new Source?  In particular:
a) How to create a new source ("MyNewSource")
b) How can I extend an existing source (box, sphere, etc.) with new
properties and methods ("MyBox, "MySphere").

Any help or suggestions are greatly appreciated.

Kind Regards,
Bertwim

Subject: [Paraview] Failure plotting cell labels
Message-ID: <CABUrC_Z-0E1r_PQi_=Cv5Yw8W=EKXN9w4=8fNvhNOpsN6YLdrA@mail.gmail.com>

I'm trying to plot Cell labels in Paraview 4.1.0
by defining a string array of cell data. However,
I get an error in Find Data dialog when I try to select
the cells. This very simple vtu file demonstrates the
problem.

Interestingly, when I attach a string array as point data
in essentially the same way as I add the cell data, I don't
have any problems plotting Point labels.

If someone can tell me what I'm doing wrong, I would
be most appreciative.

Bill

Good day.
Thank you.

You may be able to explain. What kind of filter is it?

And there is another question.
Deployed software. I go to http://localhost/apps/Visualizer /. As a result, I
see only the inscription ParaViewWeb and flailing wheel. And he gave me a
list of errors in the console:

Subject: [Paraview] HOWto create / extend sources?

> a) How to create a new source ("MyNewSource")

You define the 'proxy' under the "sources" group, rather than filters.
It will automatically show up in the Menu. Look at sources.xml under
[1] to see other source proxy definitions.

> b) How can I extend an existing source (box, sphere, etc.) with new
> properties and methods ("MyBox, "MySphere").

Similar to the filters, you basically need to write a new VTK
algorithm with these new methods. You can subclass the existing VTK
source. Looking at sources.xml, you can find out which proxy using
which VTK algorithm, e.g. "SphereSource" (labelled as "Sphere") uses
"vtkSphereSource". After adding the methods on the VTK algorithm, next
part is exposing those methods as properties using the XML.

Subject: [Paraview] python programmable filter via xml with multiple
	input
In-Reply-To: <220BE31773B69D4C985CA5660D992DB16D5BF8CB@ex-mbx-pro-03>
References: <220BE31773B69D4C985CA5660D992DB16D5BF8CB@ex-mbx-pro-03>
Message-ID: <CADHSJjACHLxBuztW9jmcCp6ctPhYVSL-L1f9nZoaSF6=2xWJgQ@mail.gmail.com>

In your example, your XML is setup to provide the inputs on multiple
"ports", while you're code is expecting multiple "connections" on same
port. Use the following script, instead.

    print self.GetInputDataObject(0, 0).GetNumberOfPoints()
    print self.GetInputDataObject(1, 0).GetNumberOfPoints()

Thanks, I can patch that if you don't have the patience.

Can you share your launcher configuration file?  It appears you may have no
"visualizer" application command line configured.

I think this is a very very old bug.

For some reason, *RECTMesh (vtkRectilinearGrid) has been ijk instead of kji
for as long as I can remember.

*SMesh (vtkStructuredGrid) and *CoRectMesh (vtkImageData) are normal on the
other hand.

Message-ID: <D04EDFBB.1C1FC%kmorel@sandia.gov>

In the new release of ParaView 4.2, I notice that the behavior of the Scale Mode property has changed a bit. The default used to be "vector" but now the default is "off." Is there a reason for the change?

Also, the "Scalars" and "Vectors" attributes used to get disabled when they have no effect on the output. Now they never get grayed out.

Message-ID: <D04EE52F.1C21B%kmorel@sandia.gov>

I couldn't see the files you posted to dropbox because they were deleted before I got a chance to see them. I also cannot even guess what Star-CCM is doing since I haven't seen that either.

One thing you can try is to apply the loop subdivision filter. That filter subdivides triangles in a polygonal mesh and applies some nonlinear smoothing to the data. To use this filter, first apply the "Extract Surface" filter to your data (to convert it to polygons), and then apply "Loop Subdivision."

Thanks Ken.

Got it. It makes sense. It seems that the only way to improve the quality is to have a finer grid and a more detailed calculation of the amount of radiation (the previous image included only the direct). New images are at this link

https://www.dropbox.com/s/z9m2nr7ybj5mqqp/finermesh.zip?dl=0

I was wondering whether there was a way to at least smooth the results (see other attached image). I have looked at the filters available, but there is no such thing. When I import these results onto StarCCM I definitely see a smoother interpolation.

Thanks

Yes, ParaView will use the triangles to interpolate values between points. The interpolation you are getting is exactly as I would expect based on your data and topology. I'm not sure what you mean by "not [interpolating] in the x,y directions". The triangles are in the x-y plane and interpolation is happening in this x-y plane.

Moving into guesswork, I am imagining that you are expecting a smooth  and fairly straight contour at some distance from the buildings. The reason you don't see this is due to the representation in your data. I notice that your data contains only two values for "RadiationOnPerson." The value is either 0 or 205.7. Presumably there is some contour in space where this field discontinuously transitions from 0 to 205.7, but there is no way to accurately predict where that is from the data you are providing. Instead, ParaView is just linearly interpolating between these values, which is wrong but probably the best you can do with the data provided. The problem is made even worse by the irregular sampling of the field.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [Paraview] Fwd: VTK interpolation help

Dear group,

I hope I will be able to find an answer to my problem here.

I am not sure I understand how the interpolation works. I have generated a VTK file (attached) and I am trying to visualizing it in Paraview. The data represent the solar radiation on the ground around various buildings.

My algorithm calculates the radiation in each node of a constrained delauney triangulation. The plan is to visualize this in paraview to have a nice smooth fillled contour.

The image I get though, does not make sense to me; it seems that paraview is interpolating only within the triangles and not in the x,y directions. Am I missing something?

Thanks a lot for any help
Ruggiero

Thanks for your reply!

I'm not quite sure if that is really the problem, but it could be related.
I still think there is something wrong in the XDMF class itself.

I did some quick conversion tests for the the different mesh types using
the example data from vtk.org/VTKData.git <http://vtk.org/VTKData.git>:

VTKData/Data/SampleStructGrid.vtk:
      DATASET STRUCTURED_GRID
      DIMENSIONS 20 30 40
=>  <Topology TopologyType="3DSMesh" Dimensions="40 30 20"/>


VTKData/Data/RectGrid2.vtk:
      DATASET RECTILINEAR_GRID
      DIMENSIONS 47 33 11
=>  <Topology TopologyType="3DRECTMesh" Dimensions="11 33 47"/>


VTKData/Data/matrix.vtk
      DATASET STRUCTURED_POINTS
      DIMENSIONS 10 5 1
=>  <Topology TopologyType="3DCORECTMesh" Dimensions="1 5 10"/>


In all cases, the XDMF class reads and writes the dimensions in the
"wrong" way, i.e. ZYX instead of XYZ. Also the data arrays are
read/written in ZYX order.

The most important part for me to notice was that "ORIGIN_DXDYDZ"
(*CoRectMesh) actually specifies the spacing in ZYX and not as the
name suggests in XYZ.
Whereas the data items in "VXVYVZ" ( *RectMesh) specify the XYZ
data.
In my opinion this is kind of a bit messy, but probably not really a bug.

In my specific case, I have HDF5 files with data-arrays in XYZ order, 
i.e. z is
iterated over the fastest, then y, and x is iterated over the slowest.
After some trial and error I managed to create a valid .xmf file and read
my data correctly into paraview, though the coordinate axes are still kind
of wrong (ZYX instead of XYZ).
Important to notice here was that the "Dimensions" in the Topology section
need to match the data-structure in the HDF5 file.

Thanks for your help!

Hi all,

This is fairly urgent, so any good pointers would be greatly appreciated!

I am trying to (still) access the multi-block table in port 1 of my reader from python.  Everything I have tried has returned the vtkSructuredGrid of port 0...

Can someone in the know let me know how I can get at the data in port 1?

I have tried:

port1 = servermanager.OutputPort(reader,1)
mb = servermanager.Fetch(port1)

I have even tried doing this interactively:
1) select port 1 in the gui
2) port1 = GetActiveSource()
3) mb = servermanager.Fetch(port1)

But It is returning a vtkStructuredGrid object that appears to be the data on Port 0.  Port 1 should be a multiblock dataset with multiple vtkTables within.

again, help would be greatly appreciated!

Josh,

Refer to [1]. You can pass an optional "idx" argument to Fetch to say
which port to fetch from.

>>> data = servermanager.Fetch(reader, idx=1)

Ken, the reason for this change was that if the "scale factor" was not
setup properly, the glyphs would end up going crazy. e.g.
+ Open can.ex2, all variables, apply
+ Apply "Glyph" with everything default, except "Scale Mode" changed
to "vector".

That's oversight. I updated the panel to not be a custom panel and
forgot missed this enable/disable aspect. Mind adding a bug for that?
Should be easy to fix.

BTW, this version has new modes for seeding glyphs. The old version is
still accessible as "Legacy Glyph", in case you want to do a
comparison between the two.

I guess that makes sense. I'll just need to go back and modify the
exercises in the tutorial to introduce the couple of steps to scale and
rescale.

When selecting which labels to use, there's a "gear" icon towards the
right of the dialog for settings. In there, it has entries for the
format string to use for the labels. Currently, the default is:

    %-#6.3g

which isn't that useful for string or integer arrays. Instead, if you
use:

    %s

it appears to work here. What we should do is change the default format
string based on the array being used rather than just assuming
everything is floating point data. I'll file a bug for it.

It also appears that using an improper format string is an easy way to
make ParaView crash; I'll track that down now.

Subject: [Paraview] Question about surfaces
Message-ID: <CAE=GJraqnZ8K3s4uCO+AEFHw7PeeYZ3T_9o3hBWY3DoS-7kW5Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have a CSV file with the collums x,y,z and temperature - the points are
not equally spaced

When i open this file and apply the table to points filter, i get the image
"surface" attached, the points does not form a surface

When i load a csv file with equally spaced points, i get the complete image
represented as a surface like in the "surfacecorrect" file.

I`ve tried the extract surface filter and it didn`t help me

Can someone help me?

Att,
Leonardo Pessanha

Subject: [Paraview] python programmable filter via xml with multiple

Message-ID: <220BE31773B69D4C985CA5660D992DB16D5BFAE6@ex-mbx-pro-03>

Thanks for the clarification. I had tried this with the following error:
vtkPythonProgrammableFilter (0x5458a60): Attempt to connect input port
index 1 for an algorithm with 1 input ports.

I gather that 'SetNumberOfInputPorts()' should be called in the
constructor of the filter, which I gather is governed by the xml file?

If so, how can I expose editing of the algorithm constructor via the xml
file? 

Thanks,
Fraser

Utkarsh,


Thanks for the pointers. I'll follow-up according your suggestions.

I'm only recently doing stuff with ParaView (i.e. plugin-development).
Please accept my compliments for the way you answer questions in this
forum. The few answers you gave me + link to appropriate documentation
have been very iseful!

Regards,
Bertwim

Good day!

Yes, of course
Attached.
Also put the configuration file Apache.

Good day to all!

Please tell me how to do.
I need to create a simple shape of the lines in ParaView. Further save the
file and open it in ParaViewWeb. But there is a condition necessary to keep in
the text file, for example, in the format type * .xmf. It is necessary
that manually
edit the file. And to boot again in ParaViewWeb.
And also. Why when I try to "File -> Save Data", retained only one line, rather
than the entire set of lines?

Sincerely, Ilya

Hi

I have canopy installed on my Mac
I would like to have paraview as a module to canopy my default python
installation
I have installed paraview using the dmg file
I have added almost all the folders from the contents folder to my path
When I am trying to
>From paraview.simple import *

I get the know error of
dlopen(/Applications/paraview.app/Contents/Python/vtk/vtkCommonCorePython.so
, 2): Library not loaded:
@executable_path/../Libraries/libvtkCommonCorePython26D-pv4.1.1.dylib

  Referenced from: 
/Applications/paraview.app/Contents/Python/vtk/vtkCommonCorePython.so

  Reason: image not found



Could someone help?



Thanks



Cheers

Yannis

Thanks, I can patch that if you don't have the patience.
See: http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Git/Develop for instructions.

I can handle that.


2) Secondly, the number of polygons maxes out to 2 million taking about 90 MB. Is there a flag to change the max buffer size?

I would like to run a bigger problem running more number of polygons. I am running on an NVIDIA GTX Titan.




I don't understand. What buffer do are you talking about?


With (thetares, phires)=(1000,1000) it gives the number of cells as 1996000 and memory of 86 MB with a geometry of 130 MB. See http://imgur.com/f8vIsHR for the screenshot.

The number of polygons does not increase when the resolution is changed - (thetares,phires)=(1000,4000) gives 2044000 cells, with the memory used 87.82 MB and 135.73 MB for geometry. Screenshot at http://i.imgur.com/zF8vMHu.png

I would like to use an image with let us say, 100 M cells in Shpere().




cheers,

Thanks

Subject: [Paraview]  PV 420 unable to read state file from PV 410
Message-ID: <542A9896.7020201@onera.fr>

Hello.

I am trying the new PV 420 release using the Linux 64 bits binaries from 
PV download page.

I am trying to load a state file that was created by PV 410 and that 
reads 13 Tecplot files. The expected plot should show LIC surfaces 
colored by aerodynamic parameters (pressure or skin friction) and some 
streamlines.

When loading this state file with PV 420, I get many errors (see below), 
all surfaces are white, and some surfaces are missing.

I can't share the data, but I send also the state file in a tar.gz archive.

Best regards.

Richard

Ah, I see. There is a constant in vtkSphereSource.h that defines a max
resolution of 1000. You can change that locally, or simply make more
spheres or otherwise make a more complicated scene.

Plugins/Manta/vtkMantaTestSource.h was written for the sole purpose of
making lots and lots of polygons (reproducibly and in parallel) in order to
benchmark rendering with.

Subject: [Paraview] PV 420 unable to read state file from PV 410
In-Reply-To: <542A9896.7020201@onera.fr>

Hello,

The problem in PV 420 seems to be related with the "MergeBlocks" filter: 
when I open two Tecplot files, I first make a group with these two 
datasets, then I apply MergeBlocks on the group, and I see that there is 
a missing part on the result of MergeBlocks between the two datasets. I 
attach two pictures, one obtained with a pipeline built in PV 410 (Merge 
is OK) and the other obtained with the same pipeline built in PV 420 
(Merge is not OK).

I would like to use an image with let us say, 100 M cells in Shpere().

Your client side request to the launcher is asking for the "visualizer"
application, while the launcher (according to your launcher config) doesn't

"pipeline" key under the "apps" section to "visualizer".

Cheers,
Scott

Seems that the fact that ParaView's superbuild only builds the paraview
executable (which is tied to the appdata files) is controlled by whether
Qt is enabled in the superbuild and this wasn't used to expect the
appdata directory properly:

Utkash,

I followed-up on your suggestions, but apparently I am doing something
wrong. I hope you or somebody else can point me to the solution.

This is what I did.

1) new class: sphBoxSource.  I extended class vtkCubeSource with one
data member, with corresponding get/set method. (Code below)
2) I added an xml-file, with the source description taken from
source.xml (CubeSource). (Below)
3) I modified the CMakeList.txt accordingly.  (Below)

Magically, the new source appeared in the menu. But when clicking it,
the program crashed.
 The error message I get is:

ERROR: In
/usr/local/git/ParaView/ParaViewCore/ServerImplementation/Core/vtkSIProxy.cxx,
line 307
vtkSISourceProxy (0x30289e0): Failed to create sphBoxSource. Aborting
for debugging purposes.


I noticed that several people running into similar problems, but so far
I haven't been able to find the clue to the solution.


Before showing the code, I give the result of the compilation.

Hi. I'd like to use Paraview 4.2 to overlay a dataset of air species

(range -7700 to 7700). Is there a way to view both, e.g., with different

                        To whom it may concern,





Hello... my name is Andres Bernal and I am a London South Bank 
University student carrying out a thesis about the influence of the 
buildings shape onto the atmospheric pollutants concentration due to the
 innovative forms of them nowadays. I am working on a building known as 
"The Walkie-Talkie Building" and the third stage of the project was to read the simulations (coming from Fluidity) . In order to move along with the project we need
 to see/read the dispersion of pollutants (tracers) around the building (coming from some sources that I set up, in this case/file, 7 sources which means 7 Tracers ) with Paraview. When I set up a "Slice" in order to see such dispersion at a certain height I cannot see anything and it seems to be this could be worked out in the "Edit Color Map". I 
would like you to help me in this issue as I have been trying to figure 
out the problem but I have not been able to and I got stuck for this 
matter. I would be really grateful, thanks.

The heights of the tracers are:

Tracer 1 = 0.3
Tracer 2 = 0.5
Tracer 3 = 0.7
Tracer 4 = 0.3
Tracer 5 = 0.8
Tracer 6 = 0.5 
Tracer 7 = 0.762

The file attached below is a very simple scenario as I am working on several more complex scenarios even with more buildings. I would just like you to help me to sort out the colours issue to see the tracers, please.





Any advice would be much appreciated.





Kind Regards,





Andres Bernal

Ben,

can I safely ignore the error? Can we assume the binary installation is complete? or are there additional installation steps after appdata step that is needed for a proper ParaView binary installation? If so, how do I get around it?

thanks

Seems that the fact that ParaView's superbuild only builds the paraview
executable (which is tied to the appdata files) is controlled by whether
Qt is enabled in the superbuild and this wasn't used to expect the
appdata directory properly:

Jeff,

Try applying the "Calculator" filter with an empty "Function" to
create a second dataset which is simply pass through of the original
dataset. Now, you can show both the original dataset and the output of
the Calculator in the same view. Select different coloring arrays and
ranges and you'd be all set.

This is a little less surprising since this release does include some
major refactors to VTK when relating to structured extents. Is it
possible to get some other dummy dataset that would help reproduce
this issue? That'll make the tracking down easier.

Thanks

There are probably more files which need installed after the appdata,
but making the changes in the changeset should allow your "make install"
from the superbuild to complete fully. Once that happens, the install
should be fine.

Simon,

Attached is a patch. It basically disables the "install" failing
components with the Qt components are not being built. Let me know if
that works and I can have these changes merged into the repository.

Bert,

The problem is the CMakeLists.txt. The sphBoxSource needs to be added
as SERVER_MANAGER_SOURCES, not SOURCES. A a rule of thumb, if it's a
vtkObject subclass and not a Qt class, you generally want to put that
under SERVER_MANAGER_SOURCES. This ensure that it will get wrapped so
that ParaView can instantiate classes through their names defined in
the XML.

Ah, sorry I missed that. Yea, if you want to simply use the
vtkPythonProgrammableFilter, I'm afraid you'll have to stick with 1
input port accepting multiple connections, rather than separate input
ports. Thus, you'll need to change your XML to just have 1
<InputProperty>, however you can set the "multiple_input" attribute to
make to accept multiple input connections on the same port.

  <InputProperty clean_command="RemoveAllInputs"
                     command="AddInputConnection"
                     multiple_input="1"
                     name="Input">
     ...
  </InputProperty>

Hope that helps.

Andres,

Edit Color Map is not really the thing you're looking for, I think.
Once you've set up a slice to a specific Z value for a tracer, you
need to ensure that you're coloring with the appropriate array,
"Tracer1", "Tracer2" and so on. Attached is state generated using
ParaView 4.2. That renders 2 slices showing tracer 1 and 2 in separate
views.

Is that what you're looking for?

There are two OsX binaries available on the download page. Pick the
2'nd binary, suffixed with "Snow Leopard" for 10.6.

Assuming Canopy is built with the same Python  2.7.1 version that we
build our binaries against, you'll need to setup several environment
variables. Attached is an old script I used for ParaView 4.1 (which
was build with Python 2.6), but that'll give you hints for the
variables and the paths in the app bundle that you'd need to point to.
