These are most likely caused by a known bug in 5.4.0 with some graphics
hardware that we are trying to fix in 5.4.1. Can you let us know what your
gpu is? Also try 5.3 and let us know if both problems work there.

Thanks

Hi,

I have followed these instructions. I am trying to install it where I am
not a root user.
Can someone help to fix this issue.

 git clone --recursive
https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview-superbuild.git
 cd paraview-superbuild
 git fetch origin # ensure you have the latest state from the main repo
 git checkout v5.2.0 # replace `v5.2.0` with tag name of your choice
 git submodule update

 cd ..
 mkdir build
 cd build
 ccmake ../paraview-superbuild

Kind regards,
Mathi

Like you, I got this error some months ago when trying to build paraview 
superbuild:

/error: unknown option `is-ancestor'//
/
It was my git version wich was too old. May be try to compile a more up 
to date version of git in your home and set the path to access it.

I have installed git from 
https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/git-2.12.2.tar.xz

Hi,

I have almost build it, but getting this error:

 CMake Warning (dev) at
/pdc/vol/anaconda/4.3/py36/lib/cmake/Qt5Core/Qt5CoreConfig.cmake:115
(add_library):
   ADD_LIBRARY called with SHARED option but the target platform does not
   support dynamic linking.  Building a STATIC library instead.  This may
lead
   to problems.
 Call Stack (most recent call first):
   /pdc/vol/anaconda/4.3/py36/lib/cmake/Qt5/Qt5Config.cmake:26
(find_package)
   superbuild/projects/qt5.system.cmake:1 (find_package)
   superbuild/cmake/SuperbuildMacros.cmake:640 (include)
   superbuild/CMakeLists.txt:115 (superbuild_process_dependencies)
 This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.

Hi,

I am still having some problem with enabling the
build shared libs. I am trying to install it on a Cray machine.
I have already locally installed cmake and anaconda on their latest version.

I am attaching here the image.
Could any one tell me how to fix this issue

Kind regards,
Mathi

Subject: [Paraview] Trouble compilng Paraview
Message-ID: <CAGfE9+M-yrYaTHFchzfrSPmYdJS3UdH=O0R6Z3UGiO5FAe8Lcg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I have managed to compile Paraview with ffmpeg and Qt5. However, when I
tried running the program the following error appears:

ibprotobuf FATAL /home/qth20/Utils/paraview/ThirdParty/protobuf/
vtkprotobuf/src/google/protobuf/stubs/common.cc:62] This program requires
version 2.6.0 of the Protocol Buffer runtime library, but the installed
version is 2.3.0.  Please update your library.  If you compiled the program
yourself, make sure that your headers are from the same version of Protocol
Buffers as your link-time library.  (Version verification failed in
"/build/mir-ui6vjS/mir-0.26.3+16.04.20170605/obj-x86_64-
linux-gnu/src/protobuf/mir_protobuf.pb.cc".)
[1]    29939 abort (core dumped)  paraview

Since I have libprotoc-dev version 2.6.1 on Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS, I don't
know where the installed version of 2.3.0 comes from. Is this something I
need to configure with Paraview?

Thanks,
Quang

Thanks very much for your reply. My computer has two graphic cards: Intel HD Graphics 4000 and NVIDA NVS 5400M, respectively. I switch to 5.3 and no longer have those two problems.

These are most likely caused by a known bug in 5.4.0 with some graphics hardware that we are trying to fix in 5.4.1. Can you let us know what your gpu is? Also try 5.3 and let us know if both problems work there.

 

Thanks

Hi,

 

I downloaded the ParaView Binary Installers (ParaView-5.4.0-Qt5-OpenGL2-Windows-64bit.exe) from https://www.paraview.org/download/ and installed it on my Thinkpad T430 which is running Windows 10. I was using ParaView for the first time and found two things puzzling:

1.       When I open ParaView, the default window looks like the following. There is a small black square on the bottom left corner in RenderView1 (circled in red). I couldn?t figure out why it showed up there.

I tried other examples, and similar things happened. I couldn?t figure out why.

 

Does anybody know what might be going on and how I can fix it?

 

Thanks,

Yu

Hi all,

I've noticed that the black box problem can come from the FXAA enabled 
in the render settings (I have the same problem with my computer & 5.4) 
but it does not explain the problem with opacity. (my graphics card is a 
GeForce GTX770M)

Yu and Yves,

Clearly we need to fix the issue with Intel graphics, but are you sure your
NVIDIA card is being used for rendering? You can check in ParaView by going
to Help -> About and see which OpenGL Vendor is listed. It should say
"NVIDIA Corporation."

If it is not being used for ParaView, you can go to the NVIDIA Control
Panel and under Manage 3D Settings, set your "Preferred graphics processor"
to "High-performance NVIDIA processor".

HTH,
Cory

Yes, that's true unfortunately. By the way, if you need X, Y, and Z, you
can use one Calculator filter to produce all three with the expression

iHat*coordsX + jHat*coordsY + kHat*coordsZ

This produces a 3-component array - you can then color your isosurface by
just one of the components or by the magnitude.

I have to use the Calculator filter to expose all 3 coordinates before

You could instead use a Clip filter with Clip Type set to Box. You have to
do a little math to convert from your threshold values to the box Scale and
Position properties, but it shouldn't be too bad, and will make your
pipeline simpler and faster.

Hi Cory,

thanks for your answer, indeed that solved the problem. That's weird 
that the graphics processor was the wrong one. As far as I remembered 
the graphics processor was the good one before. It solved the FXAA 
(black box) and opacity issues.

Cheers,

Yves

Subject: [Paraview] pvbatch rendering issue
Message-ID: <CAHXhkntoT2SUYbWQbpt8g3rHWHues0afG_VV=RTtLEJMCBZgDw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I need to load a heavy pvsm state with pvbatch and render multiple
output views for my regression tests. The python script which I use is
quite straightforward:

import paraview.simple as ParaViewSimple
import os
...
ParaViewSimple.servermanager.LoadState(pvsm_file)
for view in ParaViewSimple.GetRenderViews():
  pxm = ParaViewSimple.servermanager.ProxyManager()
  view_name = pxm.GetProxyName("views", view)
  ParaViewSimple.SaveScreenshot(os.path.join(baseline_path, "%s.png" %
view_name), view)

If I launch it with pvbatch it returns multiple warnings "Warning: In
/home/kriolog/projects/caboma/SpecifX/VTK/Rendering/OpenGL2/vtkXOpenGLRenderWindow.cxx,
line 1080
vtkXOpenGLRenderWindow (0x556adac32720): warning window did not resize in
the allotted time" and generates wrong images (10 identical images of one
of the views and one different instead 11 different images). However, when
I launch the same script from ParaView it generates correct images. When I
launch pvbatch  in my docker container (osmesa, no Qt) it silently
generates the same wrong images. Could you please me give me some advice
about how to debug it?

The version of VTK which I use is 7.1.1 (slightly modified).

Thanks,
Maxim

Maxim,

Can you try passing `--use-offscreen-rendering` flag to pvbatch. Does
that help? I am not sure how you're getting incorrect sizes with
osmesa too, but let's focus of the X error to begin with.

Hi Cory,

 

My NVIDIA card was indeed not being used for rendering. Switching to NVIDIA perfectly solved my problems on ParaView v5.4. Thanks very much for your answer!

Yu and Yves,

 

Clearly we need to fix the issue with Intel graphics, but are you sure your NVIDIA card is being used for rendering? You can check in ParaView by going to Help -> About and see which OpenGL Vendor is listed. It should say "NVIDIA Corporation."

 

If it is not being used for ParaView, you can go to the NVIDIA Control Panel and under Manage 3D Settings, set your "Preferred graphics processor" to "High-performance NVIDIA processor".

 

HTH,

Cory

These are most likely caused by a known bug in 5.4.0 with some graphics hardware that we are trying to fix in 5.4.1. Can you let us know what your gpu is? Also try 5.3 and let us know if both problems work there.

Ok, I've found the source of the problem. The state has links between views
'<CameraLink name=' which somehow cause rendering of everything when I
touch a view and the view image I want to write is almost never the right
one. I removed these links and now everything works fine. Thank you for
your help!

Ps. The python script is that I've posted above (just with two hardcoded
pathes 'pvsm_file' and 'baseline_path'). The pvsm state won't be
reproducible with paraview since it uses many custom plugins.

Subject: [Paraview] Using Value of Variable At Point in Calculator Filter
Message-ID: <8cb746b3-e456-a1eb-1194-038f51269a48@ucmerced.edu>

Hi, I've been trying to figure out, in Paraview, how to use the value of 
a variable at a point in the calculator filter over a geometry. So, for 
example, I have 3 vtk files of a cube geometry with a scalar and vector 
field (x,y,z components) as data sets. I create a gradient filter for 
each one of the vector components, then use the append attributes filter 
to combine the gradients into one object, then use the calculator filter 
to compute some quantity using the gradients as well as {the value of a 
vector field component of each vtk in the middle of the cube} and plot 
the result over the cubic geometry, maybe take a slice of that cube at 
the end. I have some roadblocks that prevent me from doing this in a 
less manual, straightforward fashion:

1. I do not see a command in the calculator filter like 
EvaluateAtPoint(myvectorfieldxcomponentvtk1,(x=0,y=0,z=0.5)) to grab the 
value of the x component of the vector field from vtk1 at point 
(0,0,0.5) in Cartesian coordinates and use it in some quantity like 
gradientx*5*EvaluateAtPoint(...) which would be evaluated over the 
entire cubic geometry, but always use the value of that point in the 
middle. I have used this sort of thing before in a program called 
COMSOL, which possesses such a feature in the Scoped Evaluation list 
called at3_geometry, among many other variations.

2. Even if there was a command like in #1, the append attributes command 
doesn't seem to respect the different sources of the vector field, so I 
see only one vector field in the resulting array (by contrast, I can 
name the gradients of the vector field components uniquely in each of 
the filters that outputs them, and the append attributes filter shows 
three distinct batches of gradients from each filter I applied to each vtk).

3. I tried to create a probe at the location I need, but the geometry it 
produces is a single point and thus using it either {directly with 
append attributes to the other gradient results} or {with a calculator 
filter first to get only the quantity I want instead of the scalar field 
and the vector fields evaluated at that point and then use the append 
attributes command} doesn't work because the append attributes 
apparently uses only the overlapping geometry, which of course is only 
the one point.

4. I tried to use group datasets instead, thinking maybe it would just 
take the value I make in the calculator filter from the probe location 
filter and use it in the final calculator filter, but it just throws a 
bunch of errors which I assume again stem from the mismatch of geometry.

5. I had an idea to maybe just clone each of the original vtks to get 
the geometry I need in a new array, and then somehow set all the 
datapoints in each one to the value I get from the probe location 
filter, but this would not only again encounter the problem in #2 with 
the nonunique naming, but I also do not know how to edit the individual 
data points in the file (I see an inkling of this idea in the blog post 
here: https://blog.kitware.com/zero-copy-arrays/ but it's quite beyond 
my current level of understanding of Paraview).

The current alternative (that definitely works) is to just manually copy 
the value I get from {the probe location filter or plot over line filter 
or something like that } into the final calculator filter, but I'd have 
to do that for every one of the batches of 3 vtk files I get, which is 
going to get very large when I start varying my more complicated 
geometry with parametric sweeps (I also need to figure out how to 
automate the process of outputting the slice I take at the end, but one 
problem at a time! I welcome any suggestions on this front).

Yes, but you will need to build ParaView with either OSMesa or EGL (if you
have a compatible NVidia GPU).

When you do so, you won't need to build the Qt UI.

This is strange, it seems that you have the Web code of ParaView 4.

How did you get/build ParaView? Are you sure it is ParaView 5.2?

Hi Andy,

I tested you suggestion about using multiple script in co-processing. In 
this case, i used following code in the adaptor side to add multiple 
pipeline

       for (int i = 0; i < *nscript; i++) {
         pipeline->Initialize(pythonScriptNames[i]);
         g_coprocessor->AddPipeline(pipeline);
       }

When i run the simulation, i am getting following warning

Warning: In 
/okyanus/users/uturuncoglu/progs/paraview-5.3.0/src/ParaViewCore/VTKExtensions/Core/vtkPVTrivialProducer.cxx, 
line 66
vtkPVTrivialProducer (0x13816760): New time step is not after last time 
step.

the output seems not correct and it is zoom out version of second 
pipeline (png file). The first pipeline is not even triggered. Do i 
missing something in here? BTW, i am using PV 5.3.

Thanks,

--ufuk

dear experts
I am trying to compile Paraview with the latest superbuild using gcc 4.8.5
the compilation fails with the error message that C++14 is needed...
*configure: error swr requires C++14 support*

This raises two questions:
1/ Can one switch to c++11  and if yes, how ?
2/ what is the minimal configuration for gcc one needs to setup in order to
be able to compile Paraview with superbuild.
thanks

Hi Nabil,

That was a regression that snuck in just before the 5.4.0 tag. Apologies.

One commit beyond the tag fixes it by patching mesa 17.1.1 to remove the
c++14 dependency.
https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview-superbuild/commit/aa8a66b270fb481e39b9919f9ea68017a3a1543b

The patch is also now in mesa 17.1.3. ParaView 5.4.1 will address this by
bumping mesa and removing the patch.

Many thanks for that Cory.

Another related question if I may.
Does the Linux version have self-contained MPI support or do I need to install that too?
It runs without complaining about it.

1  Is the zip version essentially a standalone app that can be installed simply by extracting and a shortcut to the exe?

 Yes, the paraview.exe will work right out of the unzipped directory.

2  What is the difference between the MPI-windows and -windows versions of the app?

I appreciate MPI is for parallel working, but does one version (which?) come with self contained MPI support, while the other requires MPI support to be independently installed.

Neither version comes with self-contained MPI support. The MPI version on Windows requires that you install Microsoft's MPI, which you can obtain here: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb524831(v=vs.85).aspx. The non-MPI version simply does not make use of MPI, even if you have Microsoft's MPI installed.

Message-ID: <HE1P194MB02340F861DEA0FC3B90DEF7D97D40@HE1P194MB0234.EURP194.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

Dear members,


I would like to have Catalyst precompiled and ready for use for developers that want to work on my project. In this way they don't need to go through the procedure of installing dependencies and building Catalyst themselves (which currently takes longer than building my project...).


The problem is the absolute paths that are used in all the .cmake files, such as ParaViewConfig.cmake and UseParaView.cmake (and all .cmake files they call on).


I thought a "make install" would do the trick as normally it will copy all the essential files (system independent) to the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX directory. But I cannot use the contents of the installation folder as the directory to point to when linking to Catalyst in my project (since there are no configuration files copied).


I was doubtful to ask this question, because if it were possible, I would expect a precompiled Catalyst to be hosted on the ParaView download page. But out of curiosity I ask nonetheless; is it possible?


Best,

Jimmy

Subject: [Paraview] Force Programmable Filter to Run in Serial
Message-ID: <CAOO6v06RDdU34Y3ykcB=tf6-ou77HVJJJ0hz7oGGtvok3eEEdg@mail.gmail.com>

All,

I currently have a python script that uses a programmable filter to pull
values (scalars) from one block of a data set and add them to a different
block:

output = self.GetOutputDataObject(0)

output.DeepCopy(grids)


numofcells = grids.GetNumberOfCells()

Pinf = farfield.GetCellData().GetArray('Pinf').GetValue(0)

Minf = farfield.GetCellData().GetArray('Minf').GetValue(0)

Vinf = farfield.GetCellData().GetArray('Vinf').GetValue(0)


PinfArray = vtk.vtkDoubleArray()

PinfArray.SetName('Pinf')

MinfArray = vtk.vtkDoubleArray()

MinfArray.SetName('Minf')

VinfArray = vtk.vtkDoubleArray()

VinfArray.SetName('Vinf')\


for i in range(numofcells):

    PinfArray.InsertNextValue(Pinf)

    MinfArray.InsertNextValue(Minf)

    VinfArray.InsertNextValue(Vinf)


output.GetCellData().AddArray(PinfArray)

output.GetCellData().AddArray(MinfArray)

output.GetCellData().AddArray(VinfArray)


I wrote the script using a small data set, employing only one processor.
With much larger data sets the other parts of the script benefit from
parallel execution, but my programmable filter is no longer working well.
The programmable script appears to execute on each processor, and each
processor is holding a portion of the data. The programmable filter output
shows partial Pinf, Minf, and Vinf arrays.

So, I have two options. I can either add the necessary commands to this
programmable filter script to allow it to correctly run across multiple
processors, or I can possibly force all the data back onto one processor
for this step, and run this programmable filter on only one node.

Which is easier, and how would I go about doing it?

Please note, both my Request Information and Request Update Extent scripts
are currently blank, and both input data types are unstructured grids.

Any help will be much appreciated!

Thanks,
Mike Tree

Subject: [Paraview] C++ Catalyst vtkSocket::Receive stuck in loop on Windows
Message-ID: <00ba01d2f598$a5554a30$efffde90$@mechanik.tu-darmstadt.de>

Dear Members,

 

I wanted to get rid of the dependency on Python. The connection by pure C++
works just fine.

 

The problem occurs when establishing the live connection to Paraview,
closing Paraview and then try to send some data again.

I tracked it down to the vtkSocket class inside the method Receive. After
the connection is terminated on the Paraview side, e.g. by closing Paraview,
the call of vtkLiveInsituLink::InsituUpdate gets stuck in the
vtkSocket::Receive method. Even though I get a message that the connection
was terminated.

 

A temporary fix for my case was to replace in Line 609 of the vtkSocket.cxx
if (nRecvd == 0) with if (nRecvd <= 0), because on disconnection the return
value of nRecvd is -1. Then everything works well.

 

I only used the following methods in the given order to transfer the data:

 

vtkLiveInsituLink::InsituUpdate

vtkSMSourceProxy::UpdatePipeline

vtkLiveInsituLink::InsituPostProcess

 

 

Are there further steps to perform or is there a way to check if the
connection is still alive?

 

 

Operating System: Windows 7, Visual Studio 2017

 

Thanks,

Simon

Dear All,

I have a very low resolution netCDF that I would like to visualize as 
cell data using lon/lat projection. Reading the data using lon/lat 
projection, the variables are represented as point data (image1). If the 
data is read in spherical, the variables are represented as cell data 
(image2). Comparing both, shows that some features are missing in the 
lon/lat projection, see for example central America and Spain. Applying 
a PointDataToCellData filter to the point data in lon/lat smoothes these 
features away completely (image3).
Is there a possibility to visualize the data correctly, as shown with 
spherical projection, but in lon/lat? Or can the point data somehow be 
dilated so that central America and half of Europe are not "filtered" out?

Thanks for any help!
Cheers, Niklas

I'm starting again this thread as I still have a problem with mesa (and so all 
mesa advices will be in the same discussion).

Now it is on a server with an AMD Firepro GPU. The Centos6.9 mesa version is too 
old (mesa-libGL-10.4.3-1.el6.x86_64). Installing a new el6 mesa rpm 
(mesa-libGL-11.0.7-4.el6.x86_64) breaks other software so I had to compile mesa 
in paraview tree. All run fine (no error when building mesa or paraview 5.4 or 
5.3) but I discover that glyph are not working. No message output in the 
terminal to provide any help.

I've several setup of paraview 5.4 (with osmesa on cluster nodes, with nvidia 
libraries on workstations... ) and glyph is running fine so it is not a paraview 
5.4 internal problem.

On the server with the AMD Firepro GPU I use mesa-17.0.4.tar.gz with the 
following prerequisites:
- llvm-4.0.0.src.tar.xz
- libdrm-2.4.70.tar.gz
- xcb-proto-1.12.tar.gz
-  pthread-stubs-0.3.tar.gz
- libXau-1.0.8.tar.gz
- libxcb-1.12.tar.gz
- libxshmfence-1.2.tar.gz

all builded basicaly with
PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/opt/paraview-5.4.0/lib/pkgconfig  ./configure 
--prefix=/opt/paraview-5.4.0
make
make install

To build mesa-17.0.4 I use:
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/paraview-5.4.0/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export PATH=/opt/paraview-5.4.0/bin:$PATH
./configure \
PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/opt/paraview-5.4.0/lib/pkgconfig \
--prefix=/opt/paraview-5.4.0 \
--enable-texture-float \
--with-llvm-prefix=/opt/paraview-5.4.0

Of course I set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to load mesa in the Paraview tree and I check 
with strace it is used.

Any idea of what could be wrong ?

The Linux binary does indeed include a self-contained MPI implementation

I'm sure that the following is a simple question, and I found it a few
times, but didn't see any solution anywhere.

I'm plotting a 3D model loaded from a file, e.g., the cube in the following
file:

====
# vtk DataFile Version 3.0
vtk output
ASCII
DATASET STRUCTURED_GRID
DIMENSIONS 2 2 2
POINTS 8 float
0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 1 1

CELL_DATA 1
====

Next I want to add an arrow that starts at (x1,y1,z1) and ends at
(x2,y2,z2). How can I add this arrow?

I can add an arrow using Sources > Arrow. In Display I can then specify
translation, scale, orientation and origin, but it's not clear to me which
values I need to enter to get the arrow I want.

I'm using ParaView 5.4.0.

Cheers
Nico

Niklas,

My first question is, are the data actually being read in as a point data field or a cell data field? If you go to the Information panel, what does it say the data are?

I'm not at my computer to check this, but I believe that if you read data as a lon/lat projection, the mesh is most likely read as a 2D "image", and if so, that is rendered with the "slice" representation. If that's the case, can you try changing the representation to "surface"?

Hi Ken,

thanks for the reply. From your suggestion, I was playing more with the 
different output types available, and I am not sure why, but it works 
now. If I read the data using spherical coordinates checked and the 
output type set to image, the data is actually read in as 2D lon/lat 
representation, but with the data represented as cells and not as 
points. I always believed that with the spherical coordinate settings 
checked, the output would be represented on a sphere, but its obviously 
not. Good for me. Thanks again.

Cheers,
Niklas

Just to give an update, while I couldn't reproduce the issue with Giles
example, I was able to do it with another customer. It's quite a curious
thing indeed! Still figuring out where to begin to debug this -- the fact
that it's a Windows only thing makes it even more tedious -- but will keep
you posted.

Hi,

Currently you will need to save the images in the PV GUI during the Live
connection. If you need images at specific time steps you will need to set
Live breakpoints. I hope to be able to modify Catalyst image output through
the Live connection but there are a lot of options that aren't always easy
to capture so it will take quite a bit of design work to get right.

Cheers,
Andy

Hi Ufuk,

I'm guessing the issue is that the calls to Catalyst are not consistent.
Could you share your Python scripts? Also, did you modify them manually?

I tried with PV 5.3. with
the ../ParaView-v5.3.0/Examples/Catalyst/CxxFullExample/ example with the
attached scripts simultaneously by running with "./CxxFullExample
doubleoutputs.py output3.py image11.py" and got the correct output and no
warnings.

Cheers,
Andy

Hi Simon,

Is the Python dependency that you're trying to get rid of on the Catalyst
side or on the pvserver/GUI side? If I remember correctly on the Catalyst
side Python was required for the Live connection.

Andy

Subject: [Paraview] Integrating precompiled Catalyst into external

Hi Jimmy,

If you're building Catalyst and want to install for others to link against
you will want to enable the PARAVIEW_INSTALL_DEVELOPMENT_FILES CMake option
when configuring.

It may be possible to have precompiled Catalyst installs with development
files available but there hasn't been a strong call for that to be done.

Cheers,
Andy

Indeed, ParaView does not have such a command in the Calculator filter.

If I understand you correctly, you are describing how only one of the
data arrays from the inputs with the same name is copied to the
output. That is unfortunately the behavior in ParaView 5.4 and prior.
The good news is that the next version of ParaView should instead copy
all the data arrays and mangle the names of the vector field so that
you can have all three distinct vector arrays in the output of the
Append Attribute filter when you do this. See

https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/merge_requests/1639

which added this feature.

Good thinking using the Probe filter (see below), but yep, this won't
quite work.

The Group datasets filter will create a multi block data set, which
won't exactly help you.

This would also be wasteful in terms of memory usage.

I would look at using the Python scripting capabilities within
ParaView for this. You can write a Python script and run it with
pvpython - this is especially useful for running an analysis in a
batch fashion. Within your script you use the Probe filter to get the
data value at a particular location and add that value to some
Calculator expression as needed. Here's a quick example:

from paraview.simple import *

data = FindSource('MyDataSource')
probe = ProbeLocation(Input=data, ProbeType='Fixed Radius Point Source')
probe.ProbeType.Center = [1.0, 0.0, 0.0]
probe.UpdatePipeline()
probePoint = paraview.servermanager.Fetch(probe)
value_at_probe = probePoint.GetPointData().GetArray('my array name').GetValue(0)

calculator_expression = #... value_at_probe + other expression
c1 = Calculator(Input=appendedData)
c1.Function = calculator_expression
...


I hope that helps get you started. Let us know if you have other
questions about the scripting.

Thanks,
Cory

Can you just set the upper end of the TIME_RANGE to one timestep
before what you have now? In other words, instead of having the first
and last timesteps provide the same data, end the TIME_RANGE earlier
by one timestep. That will prevent the doubling of the timestep when
the animation resets.

I'm not sure about this one. Maybe someone else can chime in.

First thing first: you'll want to split your points up into several
CSV files, one for each time step. In each of the CSV files, you will
list the point positions and the ID, e.g.

path1.csv contains the first time step:

"ID","X","Y","Z"
1,0.0,1.0,0.0
2,1.0,1.1,1.2


path2.csv contains the second time step:

"ID","X","Y","Z"
1,0.0,1.0,0.0
2,1.0,1.2,1.3

and so one.

To animate these files, you will load the entire list of CSV files
through the Open File dialog by navigating to the location of these
files and selecting the group of files labeled "path..csv". Because
the data you are loading is tabular, it will open up a SpreadSheet
view showing you the raw tables. You can close this view as you won't
be needing it. Click back on the default 3D RenderView and then select
the path* source in the Pipeline Browser. To turn these into points,
use the TableToPoints filter, setting the "X Column" property to "X",
the "Y Column" to "Y", and the "Z Column" to "Z".

Now, you'll need to show the points, which aren't visible at this
point. You can add a Glyph filter to display the points with some
geometry. The "Glyph Type" will default to "Arrow", but you can change
that to "Sphere" or whatever your favorite shape is.

Coloring by ID is pretty easy. In the tool bar, color the glyphs by
the "ID" array. Open up the "Color Map Editor" and check the
"Interpret Values As Categories" box. Under "Annotations", click on
the icon with the folder and heart ("Choose preset"). Pick one of the
color map presets for categorical data. Next, click on the toolbutton
just above that with the red, yellow, and blue rectangles ("Add active
values from selected source"). This will assign the ID values to the
colors in the color map.

I hope that gets you going,
Cory

I could not reproduce either the "Slice View" crash or "Orthographic
Slice View" crash you report in ParaView 5.4 on macOS.

Judging by the stack traces you included (very helpful, by the way)
this looks more like a memory access problem within ParaView. That
problem seems to have been fixed in ParaView 5.4, though.

Thanks Cory for your idea. The problem is, that I would have to set the end of the TIME_RANGE dependently on the timesteps requested by ParaView. Otherwise the delta t between timesteps will not be equal. I could modify my filter so that the user has to select the number of timesteps in it. But I was hoping to use the already present functionalities of ParaView.

Can you just set the upper end of the TIME_RANGE to one timestep
before what you have now? In other words, instead of having the first
and last timesteps provide the same data, end the TIME_RANGE earlier
by one timestep. That will prevent the doubling of the timestep when
the animation resets.

I'm not sure about this one. Maybe someone else can chime in.

Hello Cory,

Thanks for the follow-up.



Unfortunately I do still experience this issue, I gathered a bit more information on the behavior of the issue:

Still using a 1x1x1 @(0,0,0) box:

-open second layout as tab

-open orthographic sliceview

-I can scroll on all slice views but ONLY in one direction. As soon as I scroll in the other direction on any of the views, Paraview crashes.



==> this only appends on Polygonal Meshes: If I apply the AppendDatasets filter (outputting an Unstructured Grid) to the same box, everything seems to work as expected.

This is pretty much the Hack I used for my data, convert all the object that I wanted to slice to unstructured grid. While not optimal it does the job.



Best,

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview python - loop to run through multiple files
Message-ID: <CA+h7E46rD6xXFCM6JgN_ydrdnrM_w2421UGbpwHY8WLP_jYPXQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hey :)
I'm trying to script some code so that I can load a file in and then
WriteImage and then I want this to loop through multiple files so I don't
have to change the code each time for the new path. My problem is that
paraview won't recognise a path unless it is the exact path, so I can't get
it to change automatically. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Here is
my current code:

sso2_load_python
from paraview.simple import *
fname = '/home/sophy/Desktop'
#I put the files on the desktop so the path was shorter
filenames = ["c1", "c2"]
for x in filenames:
             Loadstate("/home/sophy/Desktop/x.pvsm")
      WriteImage("/home/sophy/Desktop/image.png")

#the previous two lines have the four space indent but my phone won't let
me type it like that



Thanks - Rebekah

Hi Andy,

Strange! To test the idea and eliminate other problems i am using same 
script twice with little mods (i just changed the name of the output png 
file). So, if i pass script_1.py and script_2.py to the model, it gives 
warning like before and creates output just for second script 
(script_2.py). If i pass only one of them then the code is working 
without any problem and produces desired output.

Thanks,
Regards,

--ufuk

Dorian,

Thanks for the followup and workaround. If you could share the data
set with me or tell me how to create it with a ParaView source, I can
take a closer look.

Thanks,

Is there a equivalent of "Return 1" in the python programmable filter ?

We would like to block the updating of the pipeline upon an error in the programmable filter (just like a C++ filter).

Hi Cory,



I am actually using the "Box" source, and just let the default settings for it: X/Y/Z length = 1, center = (0,0,0).

Btw: It still occurs on a freshly compiled Paraview v5.4.0 with up-to-date mesa.



Best,

Rebekah,

I think you want to write

LoadState("/home/sophy/Desktop/%s.pvsm" % x)

to properly substitute your filename held in x into the path.

Also, you may want to clear out the loaded state after saving the
image, which you can do by calling

Disconnect()
Connect()

HTH,
Cory

Dorian,

Thanks for clarifying the source. Sorry I didn't understand from your
earlier email.

I just tried again with the official ParaView 5.4.0 binary and was
able to reproduce your crash.

I'll write up a bug report.

Thanks!
Cory

Hi Ufuk,

It's looking to me like the issue is in the adaptor some place. I tried
running your scripts (modified slightly) with the CxxFullExample
(./CxxFullExample script_1.py script_2.py) and was able to get image_s1*
and image_s2* files out of it and did not see the warning you mention. I
also modified that example to use atm_input2d instead of input for the
input/grid identifier to make sure that wasn't the case. I've attached this
example with the scripts modified to print out some debug information.

Some questions (these are pretty basic things that you've probably already
gotten working properly but maybe there's some small thing that was
forgotten):

   - Does your g_coprocessor only get created in your initialization
   routine and deleted in the finalization step? That should not be created
   and deleted during each in situ processing step.
   - Do the vtkCPPythonScriptPipelines only get added during
   initialization? They should not be added and removed from g_coprocessor
   every time step.

Also, could you try running with the scripts that I included in the cat.tgz
tarball? The print statements there will print out the time and time steps
during the simulation run to help me diagnose (both need to be increasing
between calls to Catalyst). Also, if you share your adaptor code with me I
can take a quick look.

Cheers,
Andy

Raising an exception in the Python script should a interupt your script,
however from the code I see that that wouln't exactly do what `return 0` in
RequestData for C++ filter would. Please feel to report a bug on the issue
tracker. Should be fairly easy to address in  a future release of ParaView.

We would like to block the updating of the pipeline upon an error in the programmable filter (just like a C++ filter).

Is there documentation on how the Box clip type work? I'm not quite sure 
how to do the math to convert the threshold values to the position/scale 
values.

Thanks,

Subject: [Paraview] Compute animation in parallel using pvbatch
Message-ID: <BLUPR15MB01451617DC5B06488849D3578CAA0@BLUPR15MB0145.namprd15.prod.outlook.com>

Hi all,

Currently I have a .pvsm being loaded on pvbacth with python.

Each time step of the animation is independant and generate a single file for that time step.

Now, my goal is to run multiple time steps of this state file in parallel with pvbatch.

Is it possible ?

I built Paraview 5.3 from sources on Windows 10.
I enabled some useful options that I think could help :
- PARAVIEW_ENABLE_PYTHON
- PARAVIEW_USE_MPI

Subject: [Paraview] [Camera Control] - Clipping Range
Message-ID: <8E720A6F-84A1-4646-8D77-2F3B1964DF77@gmail.com>

Hi,

I am trying to control the camera attributes from pvpython, I noticed that if I modified Clipping Range & Thickness then called Render() the values are reset to the original values. However, changes in camera position, focal point, view up and viewing angle take effect after Render().

 

Here is a snippet of the code:

from paraview.simple import *
paraview.simple._DisableFirstRenderCameraReset()

sphere = Sphere()
Show()
Render()

camera = GetActiveCamera()
camera.GetFocalPoint()
(0.0, 0.0, 0.0)

camera.GetPosition()
(0.0, 0.0, 6.69)

camera.GetClippingRange()
(5.628100000000001, 8.042850000000001)

camera.SetPosition(0,0,3)
Render()


camera.GetPosition()
(0.0, 0.0, 3.0)


camera.GetClippingRange()
(1.975, 4.2975)

camera.SetClippingRange(3,8)
camera.GetClippingRange()
(3.0, 8.0)

Render()

camera.GetClippingRange()
(1.975, 4.2975)

 

 

How can I force changes on Clipping Range & Thickness values?

 

Regards,

Currently, you can't. ParaView doesn't let user change ClippingRange. It
resets it internally before each render.

Try LockBounds.

For example:
view = GetActiveView()
view.MaxClipBounds = [x0,x1,y0,y1,z0,z1]
view.LockBounds = 1

Shuhao,

Unfortunately, the tooltips for the clip function parameters do not
appear to be working (I filed bug
https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/issues/17593 describing
the problem).

It turns out the properties for the Box clip type are defined in a way
that is a bit trickier than I thought. They are relative to the
bounding box of the input data:

* Position - center of the box function relative to the center of the
input dataset bounding box
* Rotation - Eulerian angles about the X, Y, and Z axes describing the
rotation of the bounding box
* Scale - non-uniform scale factor applied in x, y, and z relative to
the input dataset bounding box

Given how these items are defined, it will actually really be a pain
to compute the properties for an arbitrary x-, y-, and z-range.

The way you described earlier with a cascade of Calculator and
Threshold filters will work. Another way would be to use a single
Python Calculator with the expression

numpy.all((xmin <= inputs[0].Points[:,0], inputs[0].Points[:,0] <=
xmax, ymin <= inputs[0].Points[:,1], inputs[0].Points[:,1] <= ymax,
zmin <= inputs[0].Points[:,2], inputs[0].Points[:,2] <= zmax),
axis=0).astype('int')

and then Threshold by the result, which will be 0 outside [xmin, xmax,
ymin, ymax, zmin, zmax] and 1 inside it.

Thanks,
Cory

Hello Cory,

Thanks for the advice. I will give this a shot. Are there also 
documentations to create custom filters? Not just ProgrammableFilters, 
but full on filters in something like a .py file (or any other language) 
that can be easily reused?

This will allow me to perform the transformation, expose the 
coordinates, and perform the clipping operations all in one step, which 
in theory should reduce the computational time and memory required as 
there would not be excessive amount copying between each stage of the 
pipeline.

I am only asking this because my dataset consists of ~30million nodes 
each time step and paraview runs somewhat slowly on my computer, taking 
about 30-70s to process a single timestamp in order to generate an image.

Thanks,
Shuhao

Hi Andy,

Thanks for your help. I think i found the problem. In my case, the
initialization code was something like following,

...
      vtkSmartPointer<vtkCPPythonScriptPipeline> pipeline =
vtkSmartPointer<vtkCPPythonScriptPipeline>::New();
      for (int i = 0; i < *nscript; i++) {
        pipeline->Initialize(pythonScriptNames[i]);
        g_coprocessor->AddPipeline(pipeline);
      }
...

when i look at your test code i found that the pipeline variable is
created inside of the loop, which is the correct one. So, i change it like

...
      for (int i = 0; i < *nscript; i++) {
        vtkSmartPointer<vtkCPPythonScriptPipeline> pipeline =
vtkSmartPointer<vtkCPPythonScriptPipeline>::New();
        pipeline->Initialize(pythonScriptNames[i]);
        g_coprocessor->AddPipeline(pipeline);
      }
...

and now it works without any problem. So, it was wrong usage of the
pointer (my mistake). Anyway, thanks again. BTW, the output of your test
script as follows,

Subject: [Paraview]  Quadrature point data contours
In-Reply-To: <529F796D.6020400@lbl.gov>
Message-ID: <1499690423.29869.0.camel@ibnm.uni-hannover.de>

Hi,

Sorry if this has been covered before (I have attempted to read as much
as I can on this), but I am still having difficulties getting what I
want done.

I have a finite element model with data at the quadrature points, and I
wish to visualise these on a mesh (similar to nodal point values)
without having to extrapolate and average.????However the supplied
examples from other questions on this list do not seem to work properly
for my imagined use case.??There are no contours drawn for the
quadrature point data but the data is available in the spreadsheet
view.

The code to generate a file is attached.??My current method is to
import the data into Paraview and select 'Filters->Quadrature Points-
>Generate Quadrature Points.

Are there any restrictions to visualising quadrature point data???Will
there be contours shown if working correctly?

Suggestions on what is wrong here are appreciated.

Thanks in advance,
Darcy.

Shuhao,

If you don't want to use the Programmable Filter, which is actually
pretty powerful and gives you access to just about all filters in VTK
(at least those that are compiled for ParaView), then your second-best
bet for what you want to do is to create a custom VTK filter and
include that as a ParaView plugin. The documentation for ParaView
plugins [1] should get you pretty far. Note that it is usually
necessary to compile ParaView first and then build your plugin against
that local ParaView build so that the compiler and ParaView build
options match between your ParaView executable and your plugin.

As for writing a custom VTK filter, often the best guide for writing a
VTK filter is looking at other existing VTK filters, especially those
that do things similar to what you want to do. It may take some
digging and questions on the mailing list, but that's actually a
fairly reasonable way to proceed. Kitware also offers courses on
demand if you want to get up to speed in a day or so.

Hope that helps,
Cory

Subject: [Paraview] Clipping using a Surface
Message-ID: <1499695048.5139.64.camel@dzne.de>

Hi,

I have a surface surrounding a volume and I have polygonal mesh (.vtk
files).

Now I would like to cut off the part of the polygonal mesh that is
outside of this volume. I tried to play around a bit with the clipping
tools but I could not figure out how to do this.

Your help would be very much appreciated!

Thanks,

Manuel

Glad to hear it's working properly now! I figured it was something quite
subtle but not overly complex to fix once the issue was found.

Subject: [Paraview] C++ Catalyst vtkSocket::Receive stuck in loop on
	Windows
Message-ID: <01ad01d2f989$a120c1c0$e3624540$@mechanik.tu-darmstadt.de>

Sorry I think I have chosen the wrong reply method.

 

Hi Andy,

 

I already got rid of Python on both sides. CoProcessing with Live connection is working by directly using the vtkLiveInsituLink (pure C++ implementation).

 

Working with both Paraview 5.2  and 5.4.

 

My problem is closing the connection on the Live side (e.g. closing Paraview). Doing so, my Insitu side hangs (when trying again to send data, m_link->InsituUpdate, see below) in the receive method of the vtkSocket class until at some point an integer underflow happens.

 

Closing the connection from the Insitu side everything works as expected. 

 

Are there any methods to directly check if the connection is still alive?

Or is it a Windows specific problem?

 

 

 

Additionally the steps for the live connection in C++, for sure there may be more elegant ways:

 

// Initialization

 

vtkCPProcessor  *m_proc = vtkCPProcessor::New();

                m_proc->Initialize();

 

                vtkLiveInsituLink  *m_link = vtkLiveInsituLink::New();

                m_link->SetInsituPort(22222);

                m_link->SetHostname("localhost");

                m_link->SetProcessType(vtkLiveInsituLink::INSITU);

 

                vtkSMProxyManager  *m_spxm = vtkSMProxyManager::GetProxyManager()->GetActiveSessionProxyManager();

                vtkSMProxy *m_px = m_spxm->NewProxy("sources", "PVTrivialProducer");

                vtkSMSourceProxy *m_spx = vtkSMSourceProxy::SafeDownCast(m_px);

                m_spxm->RegisterProxy("sources", m_spx);

 

                vtkObjectBase *obase = m_spx->GetClientSideObject();

                vtkPVTrivialProducer *prod =

                               vtkPVTrivialProducer::SafeDownCast(obase);

                prod->SetOutput(m_toplot, m_time);    // m_toplot is a vtkMultiBlockDataSet

 

                m_link->Initialize(m_spxm);

 

                

                //Update the live side

                m_link->InsituUpdate(m_time, m_tstep);

m_spx->UpdatePipeline(m_time);

m_link->InsituPostProcess(m_time,m_tstep);

 

 

Thanks,

Simon

Hi Simon,

 

Is the Python dependency that you're trying to get rid of on the Catalyst side or on the pvserver/GUI side? If I remember correctly on the Catalyst side Python was required for the Live connection. 

 

Cheers,

Andy

Dear Members,

 

I wanted to get rid of the dependency on Python. The connection by pure C++ works just fine.

 

The problem occurs when establishing the live connection to Paraview, closing Paraview and then try to send some data again.

I tracked it down to the vtkSocket class inside the method Receive. After the connection is terminated on the Paraview side, e.g. by closing Paraview, the call of vtkLiveInsituLink::InsituUpdate gets stuck in the vtkSocket::Receive method. Even though I get a message that the connection was terminated.

 

A temporary fix for my case was to replace in Line 609 of the vtkSocket.cxx if (nRecvd == 0) with if (nRecvd <= 0), because on disconnection the return value of nRecvd is -1. Then everything works well.

 

I only used the following methods in the given order to transfer the data:

 

vtkLiveInsituLink::InsituUpdate

vtkSMSourceProxy::UpdatePipeline

vtkLiveInsituLink::InsituPostProcess

 

 

Are there further steps to perform or is there a way to check if the connection is still alive?

 

 

Operating System: Windows 7, Visual Studio 2017

 

Thanks,

Simon

Subject: [Paraview] How to properly visualize data in Paraview using HDF5?
Message-ID: <CAES0UenpTsJrajaenVnPhGB1z353_QQJ_OzYn4ysW=2Ja18SQQ@mail.gmail.com>

Good Morning,

I am trying to update the visualization portion of an HPC fluid model. Used
to use legacy VTK but its starting to reach its limits. I read that HDF5
was good for large data sets and that it could be viewed in Paraview with
XDMF. However, it seems there are so few examples online. I got a long
rectangular channel to show up but the pressure data in it is wrong.
Hopefully if I can solve this, then it will help me update my code along
with anybody else who might be struggling with the same problem.

Is the formatting for this XDMF file incorrect, or is there some other
problem I'm not considering?  I can attach the HDF5 file too if its
necessary.

<?xml version="1.0" ?><!DOCTYPE Xdmf SYSTEM "Xdmf.dtd" []><Xdmf>

cc'ing the list back in

xdmf has join for this purpose, but I typically use python filter in
paraview to join the scalars together into a vector instead. That route is
more widely traveled.

Hi,

Are you trying to close the connection from the in situ side? The design
was for the connection to be close through the GUI.

It's difficult to say what exactly is going on here without getting fairly
deep into the problem. Theoretically though it should be possible to do the
Live link in C++ as most of the Python routines call wrapped C++ routines.

There should be some way to figure out the status of the connection on the
PV server (the builtin server if you're not connected to a separate
pvserver process) either the NotifyClientDisconnected() method,
or vtkLiveInsituLink::OnConnectionClosedEvent()
or vtkLiveInsituLink::DropLiveInsituConnection() member functions.

Cheers,
Andy

	Windows
Message-ID: <020701d2fa3d$da1c6a10$8e553e30$@mechanik.tu-darmstadt.de>

Hi Andy,

 

I want to be able to close the connection from both sides. Closing the connection from the Insitu side works by calling vtkLiveInsituLink::DropLiveInsituConnection().

Closing the connection from the Live side, e.g. by closing the GUI, causes my application to hang in the vtkSocket::Receive() method.

 

After enabling the Debug mode I get the following Error on the Insitu side:

?ERROR: In D:\build\ParaView-v5.4.0\VTK\Common\System\vtkSocket.cxx, line 572

vtkClientSocket (0000000008BFFC00): Socket error in call to send. Eine bestehende Verbindung wurde softwaregesteuert durch den Hostcomputer abgebrochen.?

 

?Eine bestehende Verbindung wurde softwaregesteuert durch den Hostcomputer abgebrochen? 

This seems to be a windows specific message notifying about a software controlled termination of the connection. So the information of the termination of the connection is somewhere available. The method throwing this error is the vtkSocket::Send() method. 

 

This error shows up as soon as I close the connection from the Live side (GUI) and then perform an InsituUpdate on the Insitu side. Still after this message, my Insitu side runs into vtkSocket::Receive() and get stuck there, trying to receive data.

 

 

Additional Info: 

Performing the live visualization with the vtkCPPythonAdapter leads to the same error message and a crash of the Insitu application.

 

Attached is a minimalistic working example. In both cases the error happens.

 

Steps to reproduce:

1.       Start Paraview ->Catalyst->Connect

2.       Start the application, choose either 0 for python or 1 for cpp, then the PVTrivialproducer should show up in Paraview

3.       Close Paraview

4.       Continue the application ->crash

 

 

I hope this helps a little bit to get an insight on what I did.

 

Thanks,

Simon

Hi,

 

Are you trying to close the connection from the in situ side? The design was for the connection to be close through the GUI.

 

It's difficult to say what exactly is going on here without getting fairly deep into the problem. Theoretically though it should be possible to do the Live link in C++ as most of the Python routines call wrapped C++ routines. 

 

There should be some way to figure out the status of the connection on the PV server (the builtin server if you're not connected to a separate pvserver process) either the NotifyClientDisconnected() method, or vtkLiveInsituLink::OnConnectionClosedEvent() or vtkLiveInsituLink::DropLiveInsituConnection() member functions. 

 

Cheers,

Andy

Hi Andy,

 

I already got rid of Python on both sides. CoProcessing with Live connection is working by directly using the vtkLiveInsituLink (pure C++ implementation).

 

Working with both Paraview 5.2  and 5.4.

 

My problem is closing the connection on the Live side (e.g. closing Paraview). Doing so, my Insitu side hangs (when trying again to send data, m_link->InsituUpdate, see below) in the receive method of the vtkSocket class until at some point an integer underflow happens.

 

Closing the connection from the Insitu side everything works as expected. 

 

Are there any methods to directly check if the connection is still alive?

Or is it a Windows specific problem?

 

 

 

Additionally the steps for the live connection in C++, for sure there may be more elegant ways:

 

// Initialization

 

vtkCPProcessor  *m_proc = vtkCPProcessor::New();

                m_proc->Initialize();

 

                vtkLiveInsituLink  *m_link = vtkLiveInsituLink::New();

                m_link->SetInsituPort(22222);

                m_link->SetHostname("localhost");

                m_link->SetProcessType(vtkLiveInsituLink::INSITU);

 

                vtkSMProxyManager  *m_spxm = vtkSMProxyManager::GetProxyManager()->GetActiveSessionProxyManager();

                vtkSMProxy *m_px = m_spxm->NewProxy("sources", "PVTrivialProducer");

                vtkSMSourceProxy *m_spx = vtkSMSourceProxy::SafeDownCast(m_px);

                m_spxm->RegisterProxy("sources", m_spx);

 

                vtkObjectBase *obase = m_spx->GetClientSideObject();

                vtkPVTrivialProducer *prod =

                               vtkPVTrivialProducer::SafeDownCast(obase);

                prod->SetOutput(m_toplot, m_time);    // m_toplot is a vtkMultiBlockDataSet

 

                m_link->Initialize(m_spxm);

 

                

                //Update the live side

                m_link->InsituUpdate(m_time, m_tstep);

m_spx->UpdatePipeline(m_time);

m_link->InsituPostProcess(m_time,m_tstep);

 

 

Thanks,

Simon

Hi Simon,

 

Is the Python dependency that you're trying to get rid of on the Catalyst side or on the pvserver/GUI side? If I remember correctly on the Catalyst side Python was required for the Live connection. 

 

Cheers,

Andy

Dear Members,

 

I wanted to get rid of the dependency on Python. The connection by pure C++ works just fine.

 

The problem occurs when establishing the live connection to Paraview, closing Paraview and then try to send some data again.

I tracked it down to the vtkSocket class inside the method Receive. After the connection is terminated on the Paraview side, e.g. by closing Paraview, the call of vtkLiveInsituLink::InsituUpdate gets stuck in the vtkSocket::Receive method. Even though I get a message that the connection was terminated.

 

A temporary fix for my case was to replace in Line 609 of the vtkSocket.cxx if (nRecvd == 0) with if (nRecvd <= 0), because on disconnection the return value of nRecvd is -1. Then everything works well.

 

I only used the following methods in the given order to transfer the data:

 

vtkLiveInsituLink::InsituUpdate

vtkSMSourceProxy::UpdatePipeline

vtkLiveInsituLink::InsituPostProcess

 

 

Are there further steps to perform or is there a way to check if the connection is still alive?

So far, all indicators point to a driver bug. To confirm, is everyone
reporting this issue encountering it on NVIDIA GPUs with Windows?

Hi Simon,

I tried with PV master (84f6e514) and couldn't replicate the crash. I was
able to get the connection between the GUI and the CatalystTest executable
though since I saw the PVTrivialProducer come up in the GUI.

Maybe you could try PV master and see if it works for you. Beyond that I
think figuring out your issue would take a non-trivial amount of effort to
figure out.

Cheers,
Andy

Subject: [Paraview] Extracting actual time data
Message-ID: <CAJ80vbzhYGsRsVe51zCFR4cxx77mTVJS4F=D-qv1_VJ_P5ygOw@mail.gmail.com>

So when extracting data into a .csv file and including all time steps, is
it possible to get the actual time extracted to along with the time step?
In this particular "Plot over line" simulation that I am running, the time
steps are dynamic and not neccesarily the same length. Any help is greatly
appreciated.

Nathan,

When we export data over timesteps from an Exodus file, we run a time-plot filter first, such as Plot Global Variables Over Time.   This creates a variable which contains the length of each timestep.   If you then export to .csv, that time variable is  included.

I suppose Plot Selection Over Time would probably also work.

Hope this helps.

Hi Andy,

I just tried my example on arch linux and it works as expected. 
(ParaView 5.4.0-RC1)

Somehow I got the feeling it is an issue related to Windows. Just to be 
sure, which OS did you choose to test the example code?

Thank you very much for your time and support,
Simon

Subject: [Paraview] Running Paraview on an HPC machine with multiple
	processes?
Message-ID: <CAES0UekOE=xwwuijz58dDKQ6HVwfhH30YYXJOcLkwxdL8VnftA@mail.gmail.com>

Good Afternoon,

I have been moving to an HDF5/XDMF system for analyzing big data from a
computational fluid model. I finally got all the basic components working
on my local machine but have run into problems when trying to run on an HPC
system. Here is the XDMF file:

<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<!DOCTYPE Xdmf SYSTEM "Xdmf.dtd" []>
<Xdmf xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2003/XInclude" Version="2.1">
  <Domain>
    <Grid Name="my_Grid" GridType="Uniform">
      <Topology TopologyType="3DCoRectMesh" Dimensions="91 19 19">
      </Topology>
      <Geometry GeometryType="Origin_DxDyDz">
        <DataItem Dimensions="3" NumberType="Integer" Format="XML">
          0 0 0
        </DataItem>
        <DataItem Dimensions="3" NumberType="Integer" Format="XML">
          1 1 1
        </DataItem>
      </Geometry>
      <Attribute Name="pressure" AttributeType="Scalar" Center="Node">
        <DataItem Dimensions="91 19 19" NumberType="Float" Format="HDF">
          out.h5:/pres_group/presmag
        </DataItem>
      </Attribute>
      <Attribute Name="velocity" AttributeType="Vector" Center="Node">
        <DataItem ItemType="Function" Function="JOIN($0, $1, $2)"
Dimensions="91 19 19 3">
          <DataItem Dimensions="91 19 19" NumberType="Float" Format="HDF">
            out.h5:/velo_group/x_velo
          </DataItem>
          <DataItem Dimensions="91 19 19" NumberType="Float" Format="HDF">
            out.h5:/velo_group/y_velo
          </DataItem>
          <DataItem Dimensions="91 19 19" NumberType="Float" Format="HDF">
            out.h5:/velo_group/z_velo
          </DataItem>
        </DataItem>
      </Attribute>
    </Grid>
  </Domain>
</Xdmf>

This has worked properly on my machine. However, when I was getting an
error of failing to read the pressure data when I tried this on multiple
processes. The vector data for velocity was fine, but the pressure data
could not be read. I narrowed the problem down to something regarding the
number of processes because the pressure data worked fine on the HPC
machine if I only ran it on 1 process. Is there anything that sticks out
that could be causing this problem? For instance, is there a different
format for these files when they are run on multiple processes?

Respectfully,

Jacob Gerard

dear experts,
the superbuild currently supports mpich (
http://www.paraview.org/files/dependencies/mpich-3.2.tar.gz). Did someone
by chance try to use openmpi (which version can be used in this case?) and
if so, is there some feedback one could benefit from ?
thanks.

Nabil,

OpenMPI would work just fine too. Use can make the superbuild use an
externally built MPI implementation very easily. As documented here (
https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview-superbuild/), just set
the USE_SYSTEM_xxx (in this case, USE_SYSTEM_mpi) Cmake flag to ON and then
point to the MPI libs, if not in default path.

Hi,

I tested the PV master build now. Same thing happens as with PV 5.4 and 
5.2.
The example code works on linux but leads to a crash on windows.

In my opinion it is a bug in the vtkSocket regarding the windows 
specific code. I further investigated the problem and compared what 
happens. On linux an windows the method vtkSocket::Receive() gets called 
even after the connection is dropped by the Live side, so the call 
history should be the same.

The difference between linux and windows is that the function recv in 
line 606 of vtkSocket.cxx returns (if the connection is closed by the 
GUI) nRecvd=0 on linux and nRecvd=-1 (error code) on windows.

To fix the problem on windows I inserted the  following code at line 616 
of vtkSocket.cxx:

if ((nRecvd == vtkSocketErrorReturnMacro
	&& WSAGetLastError() == WSAECONNABORTED))
{
	return 0;
}


Maybe you can look into it.


Thanks,
Simon

Hi Jake,
     when you talk about running in multi-processing are you talking about
the solver that produces the data or about running Paraview in mpi-mode?
Which is the error you get?

Alessandro,

Paraview says that it failed to read the attribute data. I just mean that
when I connect Paraview to the machine, the pressure data does not load if
I select more than 1 node or process/node.

Jake,

If I start up the remote server in parallel using something like:
mpiexec.hydra -n 8 pvserver -sp=11111

and then connect from my workstation I am able to read an XDMF file like
the one you posted using ParaView 5.4.0.  Can you post how you are starting
your server and the exact error that you receive?

I've attached the .xmf file and a Python script to generate dummy data in a
.h5 file that corresponds to your data structure.

Note that I am using the xdmf2 reader for my testing.  The xdmf3 reader
fails to read the file (even locally in serial) with the following error:

Type not one of accepted values: INTEGER in XdmfArrayType::New
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'XdmfError'
  what():  Type not one of accepted values: INTEGER in XdmfArrayType::New
Aborted

I remember a thread from a few weeks ago that the current Linux distribution has built in MPI.  Is this correct?  Does this mean a user can use the Kitware binaries on a cluster, without rebuilding?

Thanks,

Alan

Andy,

I wasn't setting up the server or anything. I have just been connecting to
one of my preset configurations. The velocity data shows up fine but for
some reason when there is more than one processor working on the
visualization Paraview can't read it.

Here is the error:

ERROR: In
/p/home/angel/PV/4.3.1/Build_4.3.1_osmesa/paraview/src/paraview/VTK/IO/Xdmf2/vtkXdmfHeavyData.cxx,
line 1128

vtkXdmfReader (0x104ae20): Failed to read attribute data


The setup has just been clicking the connect icon, the system, and choosing
the number of nodes and processors per node. If it helps I'm on Paraview
4.3.1 64-bit. Sorry I am pretty new to all of this stuff. Slowly getting
the hang of things.

How many processors are you attempting to run on?
Is it possible to try a newer version of ParaView?  The oldest that I have
on my system is 4.4.0.

Subject: [Paraview] COMPILE AND RUN pvBatch with h5py support errors
Message-ID: <CAPd7EPrgS9rf8qKQTK+e5NozdA39Nnq_kNxtZP2wHzc+fbaoGw@mail.gmail.com>

dear experts,
on a CentOS6.8 x86_64 node, I used the Superbuild to compile Paraview
5.3.0-1 with dev tool 4 (which provides gcc 5.3 )

As shown on the attached screen captures, In the CCMAKE configuration, I
enabled Python with Matplot, Scipy, Numpy.

Once the compilation finished, I successfully added the h5py package
but if I start pvBatch or pvpython, i can see some error messages about the
hashlib module.


*ValueError: unsupported hash type sha384ERROR   : code for hash sha512 was
not found.*

This issue seems to be more a Python bug, than a Paraview issue. But maybe
someone on this mailing list did experience the issue. In case, I will be
grateful, if he or she could share his experience on how he/she solved this
issue.
thanks

I think this is usually an issue with openssl headers not being
available when compiling Python. Does installing openssl-devel and
forcing a rebuild of Python (cd $builddir; rm -rf superbuild/python) fix
the issue?

I will download a newer version and try again this morning.  Will let you
know how it goes.

I remember a thread from a few weeks ago that the current Linux distribution has built in MPI.  Is this correct?  Does this mean a user can use the Kitware binaries on a cluster, without rebuilding?

Thanks,

Theoretically, yes? Though I'd expect most clusters to have their own,
better-tuned MPI builds you'd want to prefer to a stock mpich build.

I tried a newer version of Paraview (5.2.0) and still had the same problem.
Why would this be able to run on one process but not on multiple? The
velocity still shows up and can be split based on process id. Should I put
the scalar data into the xmf in a different format?

Message-ID: <alpine.LRH.2.20.1707131437380.29075@marastik.chpc.utah.edu>

I have been having trouble running the release binary of Paraview on 
relatively stock CentOS 7.2 using
the OpenGL. It segfaults before it loads up the GUI window.. If I start 
Paraview with the --mesa option,
it works fine.

This happens with the 2.3 and 2.4 Paraview binaries, i.e. 
ParaView-5.3.0-Qt5-OpenGL2-MPI-Linux-64bit and
ParaView-5.4.0-Qt5-OpenGL2-MPI-Linux-64bit, as well as the latest build,
ParaView-5.4.0-233-g9952b9f-Qt5-MPI-Linux-64bit.

The same executables start fine both in CentOS6, and in an Ubuntu 16.10 
Singularity container that runs
on the CentOS7 host.

Before I dig further, I am wondering what is the experience on running 
Paraview on CentOS7.

Thanks,

Message-ID: <8C62AF5C-43CA-43EF-8018-110C1AA19BF1@aggies.ncat.edu>

Dear Community; 
 
I am trying to visualize my data, which is quite big. Nonetheless, I have enough RAM memory. By looking at the task manager I see that Paraview is using close to 20 GB of RAM, I have 60 GB Ram. 
In order to see the data I need to click the right button and move the mouse. When I release the mouse I only see the background. AS you can imagine I can do nothing since I cannot apply filters and so forth. 
Any suggestions? 

Thanks before Hand
Julio

Thank you very much for your help, that helped a lot! Some notes for 
anyone else finding this and needing some help: Using the Trace feature 
is extremely useful for getting the majority of a script written, and 
then the above code can be inserted. However, two changes had to be made 
in at least my case:

 1. probePoint.GetPointData().GetArray('my array name').GetValue(0) had
    to be changed to probePoint.GetPointData().GetVectors('my vector
    name').GetValue(0) as the data type being probed was a vector.
 2. When using value_at_probe in my calculator_expression variable, it
    couldn't just be dropped in. Since my expression was a string like
    calcexp='(gradient_x*2/value_at_probe)^(1/2)', it needed to be
    changed to calcexp='(gradient_x*2/{})^(1/2)'.format(value_at_probe)
    so that the numerical value was passed in as a string, and then
    passed to the calculator filter.

Subject: [Paraview] CTest and offscreen rendering
Message-ID: <CAHXhknvdDQYRD7KzhVk9Qg3SOKB7BR8a6xgi-jtT4a+NMZQj6g@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am trying to run my paraview python regression tests with ctest on a
platform without X server. I've compiled paraview with osmesa and with
opengl (VTK_USE_X is ON; sounds strange but there is a reason for that :)
). When I run 'pvbatch --use-offscreen-rendering' my test passes. However,
ctest gives me the same error (bad X server connection. DISPLAY=) which I
have if I run pvbatch without use-offscreen-rendering. Is it possible to
forward this argument to the ctest command?

Regards,
Maxim

The binaries are built in a CentOS 6 container, but CentOS 7 should
still work. Is there any other output? Can you get a backtrace from
running paraview under gdb?

Hi,

If you're not memory constrained I suggest just doing a full ParaView build
with OSMesa and X11 disabled. There are quite a few discussions on the PV
mailing list on how to do that.

If you're memory constrained then I would suggest building with all of the
Catalyst editions enabled and see if that works for you.

Best,
Andy

Alas, there's no option to do that currently. It should be doable, but
would need some tweaking of the Cmake code. If you're interested, a good
starting point would be CMake/ParaViewTestingMacros.cmake.

Julio,

If your data is large enough, perhaps you are running out of RAM on
your GPU. Do you get any error messages? Also, can you visualize
something simple like a Sphere source or Wavelet source?

Thanks,
Cory

Thanks Utkarsh,

Ok, I'll just modify PARAVIEW_PVBATCH_ARGS in my test CMakeLists:

if(VTK_OPENGL_HAS_OSMESA AND PARAVIEW_BUILD_QT_GUI AND VTK_USE_X)
set(PARAVIEW_PVBATCH_ARGS --use-offscreen-rendering) endif()

Hi Ben, thanks for the reply.

I tried the backtrace but it does not show anything useful since there are 
no symbols in the binary. Do you have a binary build that includes symbols 
that I could download and try to run?

Thanks,
MC

Not on hand, sorry. The backtrace might help a bit since it would at
least show the libraries involved in the traceback.

So, as you can see, not much of use. We did do a source build of 5.3 as well which also crashes (though I was not the one who did it), so, let me see if I can do something with that and get back to you.

Run `bt` (short for `backtrace`) to get a trace. Though if this frame is
`NULL`, I suspect something went really badly somewhere :/ .

dear experts,
I recently moved a software from PV 4.3 to PV 5.2.0 and the software I am

Was it simply removed ?
thanks.

Help on function GetLookupTableForArray in module paraview.simple:

Nabil,

As the doc suggests, it's been replaced by `GetColorTransferFunction`.  The
params are quite comparable except that it does not  need the number of
components any more.

The more I think about this, I wonder if the answer is no?  After all, you would want the sbatch and srun to come from the same version of MPI that is linked into the application, would't you?

Giles et al.

We finally have fix for this. Together with Ben, we tracked it down to
being a MTime wrap-around issue. It's fixed here:
https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/merge_requests/1777

It will be included in upcoming 5.4.1.

Thanks for your help with reproducing this bug.

I am assuming the sbin and srun you mention come from Slurm. This
documentation [1] for MPICH2 with Slurm suggests that you really
should build it against your Slurm installation. Towards the end,
however, it includes an example that *may* work for launching the
current ParaView linux binaries with Slurm using:

salloc -N 2 mpiexec my_application

It could looks like it would be fast to try out if you want to give it
a shot. Just sub out "my_application" with "pvserver".

I tried to look for /lib/core/vtkweb-loader.js, but this location doesn?t exist in the current version. It seems to be existed in older versions such as 5.1, so I tried to install 5.1 as well but I got the same error.

Try LockBounds.

 

For example:

view = GetActiveView()

view.MaxClipBounds = [x0,x1,y0,y1,z0,z1]

view.LockBounds = 1

Hi,

I am trying to control the camera attributes from pvpython, I noticed that if I modified Clipping Range & Thickness then called Render() the values are reset to the original values. However, changes in camera position, focal point, view up and viewing angle take effect after Render().

 

Here is a snippet of the code:

from paraview.simple import *
paraview.simple._DisableFirstRenderCameraReset()

sphere = Sphere()
Show()
Render()

camera = GetActiveCamera()
camera.GetFocalPoint()
(0.0, 0.0, 0.0)

camera.GetPosition()
(0.0, 0.0, 6.69)

camera.GetClippingRange()
(5.628100000000001, 8.042850000000001)

camera.SetPosition(0,0,3)
Render()


camera.GetPosition()
(0.0, 0.0, 3.0)


camera.GetClippingRange()
(1.975, 4.2975)

camera.SetClippingRange(3,8)
camera.GetClippingRange()
(3.0, 8.0)

Render()

camera.GetClippingRange()
(1.975, 4.2975)

 

 

How can I force changes on Clipping Range & Thickness values?

 

Regards,

I am trying to use the LegacyVTKReader command in paraview.simple to create pipelines for vtk timeseries. The following command:

TEST_FEM_MeshData = LegacyVTKReader(FileNames = MeshDataList)

Works well but does results in pipelines with generic names like "LegacyVTKReader1" and "LegacyVTKReader2". How do I get this command to allow me to control the resulting pipeline name? I want the name to be "TEST_FEM_MeshData" for example.

Regards,

Amine

Hi Mathi,

The default build environment on Cray systems is to only build static
libraries.  Try setting the environment variable CRAYPE_LINK_TYPE=dynamic
and then starting from a clean build directory.  A word of caution when
using Anaconda python, be sure to remove anaconda's MPI package; it
conflicts with the cray-mpich module, which is what you need to use, since
they're both MPICH variants and end up getting mixed up by the runtime
linker and cause segfaults.  If you have the latest Cray programming
environment installed, a better Python option would be to use the newly
released cray-python module instead of anaconda.

- Chuck

Try the following:

TEST_FEM_MeshData = LegacyVTKReader(FileNames = MeshDataList,
registrationName="MyName")


You can also use `RenameSource` to rename it after the fact.

e.g.


RenameSource("NewName",  TEST_FEM_MeshData)

Subject: [Paraview] Referring to render views without creating a separate
 variable for each one
Message-ID: <DEA101B66315B941B487EAE03CFFF44346437B17@V-EXC-C02.DIRECTORY.INTRA>

Hello,
How do I select a render view within a layout without necessarily having to declare a new variable to hold it? In the python stack trace I am getting something like this:
SetActiveView(renderView1_2)
Where renderView1_2 is previously defined as:
renderView1_2 = CreateView('RenderView')
I am planning to develop something that can create multiple Render views and jump from one to another in a loopwise fashion. This would only be possible for a method where the views can be referred to by list number for example. It would be tedious or not possible for the above construct.
Any ideas most welcome. Thanks for your help.
Regards,

Amine

As Seb mentioned, it seems like you're still getting some older version of
the javascript code.  Perhaps it could help if you clear your browser cache
and reload the page?  Or maybe somehow you didn't get the version of
ParaView you intended?

Hope this helps,
Scott

You have access to a function called `GetViews` which will return a list of
all views currently present. If that what you're looking for?

Sorry for the spam, but ParaView/Catalyst users may be interested in this workshop.


Update: paper submission due date extended to 15 Aug 2017 23:59 AoE

ISAV 2017: In Situ Infrastructures for Enabling Extreme-Scale Analysis and Visualization

In cooperation with SIGHPC and held in conjunction with SC17: The International Conference on High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis, Denver, Colorado, U.S.A.

            ISAV 2017 - http://vis.lbl.gov/Events/ISAV-2017/

         Full-day 9:00 AM - 5:30 PM Sunday November 12th, 2017

Workshop Theme

The considerable interest in the HPC community regarding in situ analysis and visualization is  due to several factors. First is an I/O cost savings, where data is analyzed/visualized while  being generated, without first storing to a file system. Second is the potential for increased  accuracy, where fine temporal sampling of transient analysis might expose some complex behavior missed in coarse temporal sampling. Third is the ability to use all available resources, CPUs and accelerators, in the computation of analysis products.

The workshop brings together researchers, developers and practitioners from industry, academia, and government laboratories developing, applying, and deploying in situ methods in extreme-scale, high performance computing. The goal is to present research findings, lessons learned, and insights related to developing and applying in situ methods and infrastructure across a range of science and engineering applications in HPC environments; to discuss topics like opportunities presented by new architectures, existing infrastructure needs, requirements, and gaps, and experiences to foster and enable in situ analysis and visualization; to serve as a "center of gravity" for researchers, practitioners, and users/consumers of in situ methods and infrastructure in the HPC space.

Participation/Call for Papers and Oral Presentations

We invite two types of submissions to ISAV 2017: (1) short, 4-page papers that present research results, that identify opportunities or challenges, and that present case studies/best practices for in situ methods/infrastructure in the areas of data management, analysis and visualization; (2) lightning presentation submission, consisting of a 1- or 2-page submission, for a brief oral presentation at the workshop. 
Short papers will appear in the workshop proceedings and will be invited to give an oral presentation of 15 to 20 minutes; lightning round submissions that are invited to present at the workshop will have author names and titles included as part of the proceedings. Submissions of both types are welcome that fall within one or more areas of interest, as follows:

Areas of interest for ISAV, include, but are not limited to:

    In situ infrastructures

       * Current Systems: production quality, research prototypes
       * Opportunities
       * Gaps

    System resources, hardware, and emerging architectures

       * Enabling Hardware
       * Hardware and architectures that provide opportunities for in situ processing, such as burst buffers, staging computations on I/O nodes, sharing cores within a node for both simulation and in situ processing

    Methods/algorithms/applications/Case studies

       * Best practices
       * Analysis: feature detection, statistical methods, temporal methods, geometric methods
       * Visualization: information visualization, scientific visualization, time-varying methods
       * Data reduction/compression
       * Examples/case studies of solving a specific science challenge with in situ methods/infrastructure.

    Simulation

       * Integration: data modeling, software-engineering
       * Resilience: error detection, fault recovery
       * Workflows for supporting complex in situ processing pipelines

    Requirements

       * Preserve important elements
       * Significantly reduce the data size
       * Flexibility for post-processing exploration


Review Process

All submissions will undergo a peer-review process consisting of three reviews by experts in the field, and evaluated according to relevance to the workshop theme, technical soundness, creativity, originality, and impactfulness of method/results. Lightning round submissions will be evaluated primarily for relevance to the workshop.

Submission Process

Authors are invited to submit papers of at most 4 pages in PDF format, excluding references, and lightning presentations of at most 2 pages in PDF format, excluding references. Papers must be submitted in PDF format (readable by Adobe Acrobat Reader 5.0 and higher) and formatted for 8.5" x 11" (U.S. Letter). Submissions are required in the ACM format (http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates) using the sample-sigconf template and submitted via EasyChair (https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=isav17). No changes to the margins, spacing, or font sizes as specified by the style file are allowed.

Papers must be self-contained and provide the technical substance required for the program committee to evaluate their contributions. Submitted papers must be original work that has not appeared in and is not under consideration for another conference or a journal. See the ACM Prior Publication Policy for more details (http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/). Papers can be submitted at https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=isav17.

Publication in proceedings, presentation at the workshop

All paper submissions that receive favorable reviews will be included as part of the workshop proceedings, which will be published through SIGHPC along with other SC17 workshop proceedings in the ACM Digital Library and IEEE Xplore. Lightning round submissions will not be included as part of the proceedings.

Subject to the constraints of workshop length, some subset of the accepted publications will be invited to give a brief oral presentation at the workshop. The exact number of such presentations and their length will be determined after the review process has been completed.

Timeline/Important Dates

   15 August 2017      Paper submission deadline
   15 September 2017   Author notification
   30 September 2017   Camera ready copy due
   15 October 2017     Final program posted to ISAV web page
   12 November 2017    ISAV 2017 workshop at SC17

For a simulation I am running, I would like to visualize a bunch of spheres in ParaView (PV). At the moment I do that by sending point data to PV and creating a Glyph filter (Sphere type) on all the points, where the radius is determined by attribute data I pass along the point data.


Now for my project I would like the user to be able to select each sphere (i.e. Glyph object), such that it's attribute data can be displayed (like the Hover On functionality); and in the best case I would like to have this attribute data (such as radius) to be modifiable (for now I just a programmable filter in which the user manually fills in the ID of the sphere to change it's corresponding attribute data).


So my two questions are:

1) Can I select the Glyph as a whole? All the selection options will only select the cells of which the glyph is made of, not the actually sphere.

2) In the Python shell will I be able to see the selected (spheres /glyphs) in order to do some attribute data modifications?


Best,

Jimmy

Hello all


I have 2 sets of data, and I have a plot of x1 vs time and x2 vs time from the 2 data sets. Is there a way to average out the data and plot the average x vs time within paraview?


Thanks!

 data into ParaView
Message-ID: <2F8BA25CC0B82C4DB6756F8F663E6DB35BF3E570@CITESMBX3.ad.uillinois.edu>

Hi All,

I am doing some ALE multiphase fluid computations utilizing a moving mesh, and I am reading an Exodus database into ParaView. The database contains many time steps and multiple blocks.

The database contains a 3D mesh, and the usual quantities such as velocities and pressure, and mesh displacements.

Using my CFD code I compute an integral quantity at each time step. This quantity is not written to the Exodus file, it is available in a separate text file. I would like to read this quantity into ParaView for each time step, and use it in a computation together with point data.

Basically I am computing the centre of mass of an Exodus block, so that I could subtract that quantity from all the mesh displacements to get the mesh to be in the reference frame of a specific Exodus block. Because the centre of mass is a function of time only (not of space), I am guessing I would either import this as field data or as point data by setting the variable's value to be the same at every node in the mesh for a specific time step. I would like to use the ParaView calculator to subtract the time dependent data from the space and time dependent mesh displacements.

Any ideas?

Any advice would be very much appreciated!

Thanks very much,

Jairaj,

My first thought would be to use a Programmable Filter:

https://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Python_calculator_and_programmable_filter#Programmable_Filter

The examples are for PointData, but it also works for CellData.

I hope this helps.  Please contact me with any comments, questions, or
concerns.

Thank you,

Mark,

I have discussed the changes I made with my colleagues.
We do not want to harm your work with the Cave,
so we would be okay with backing out our changes.

We can scale our data to be of size greater than 1 
by using the transform data inside of ParaView
and our data will still work. My changes were only
necessary when working with data of size less than or 
a lot less than zero.

Please let me know what I can do to assist, my changes
are found in the ParaView 5.x versions, ParaView 4.4.0
still has your code in it without my changes for visualizing
small data in stereo with devices such as the zSpace.

Thanks,

Joe

Subject: RE: [Non-DoD Source] [Paraview] Eye separation has been wrong since
Immersive ParaView 5.2 - here's how to fix it

Hello,

I am the one who requested the changes,
they were made to correct the stereo separation with working with zSpace
hardware
for data that was small in size (floating point values of coordinates, >> 1,
for example data that ranged from 0.0000000 to  0.0000001
I checked its use with data across 13 orders of magnitude from data of size
1,000,000 to data of scale 1/1,000,000.
I admit my fix is an approximation, but I am attempting to get a reasonable
agreement of size with  the non stereo operation

  double eyeSeparationCorrectionFactor = 10.0;
  double shiftDistance = this->EyeSeparation / (2.0 *
eyeSeparationCorrectionFactor);
  if(this->Distance < 1.0)
  {
    shiftDistance *= this->Distance;
  }

  // Front (aka near)
  double F = E[2] - (this->Distance + this->Thickness);//E[2] -
10000.0;//this->ClippingRange[1];
  // Back (aka far)
  double nearDistanceCorrectionFactor  = 1000.0;
  double B = E[2] - (this->Distance / nearDistanceCorrectionFactor);//E[2]
- .1;//this->ClippingRange[0];

Without these changes with small data the stereo separation is incorrect,
(too large)
also small data will not even show up in the render window as the clipping
planes will be wrong.

This change

"  if (cameraParallel == 0 && dot(normalVCVSOutput,vertexVC.xyz) > 0.0) {
normalVCVSOutput = -1.0*normalVCVSOutput; }"

I did not make and do not know its purpose.

I think we  need a solution that works for both caves and planar display
hardware,
and I think the underlying issue is that there is different render code
being used,
that is a subset of the full normal rendering solution, which is creating
these issues.
I think the correct solution is to remove  the separate render code and use
the primary
code for both client and server rendering of mono and stereo. I do not have
a cave to
test with, but I do not see why we can not find a solution that works for
everyone.

Thanks,

Joe

Hello,

If you're an Immersive ParaView user, you may have noticed that 5.x versions
don't work as well in your CAVE. Specifically, I've noticed the following
differences when compared with ParaView 4.4.0:

1) I can place an object in space properly but it seems to move 10x as fast
when I move my head.
2) If I move the object just a little farther away from its initial
position, it clips out (vanishes).
3) When I am viewing a triangle mesh, some triangles seem to flip normals
(and get dark) when I move the object around.

The first two problems are caused by a change in the VTK source code from
March 2016 which arbitrarily multiples the eye separation distance by 10,
and also tightens the near and far clipping planes. The third can be
corrected by adding a single comment (which will help CAVE and Immersive
users, but probably nobody else). Both fixes will require you to build
ParaView from source - which you're probably doing anyway. I can't comment
on how these changes will affect HMD VR users.


The first and second problems are caused by a single commit to the VTK
repository that began to appear in ParaView with version 5.2.0. The problem
code is in VTK/Rendering/Core/vtkCamera.cxx starting at line 452 in versions
5.3 and 5.4. This problem can be fixed by replacing

  double eyeSeparationCorrectionFactor = 10.0;
  double shiftDistance = this->EyeSeparation / (2.0 *
eyeSeparationCorrectionFactor);
  if(this->Distance < 1.0)
  {
    shiftDistance *= this->Distance;
  }



with simply

  double shiftDistance = this->EyeSeparation;


The second problem (clipping planes) is just a few lines down. I fixed it by
replacing

  // Front (aka near)
  double F = E[2] - (this->Distance + this->Thickness);//E[2] -
10000.0;//this->ClippingRange[1];
  // Back (aka far)
  double nearDistanceCorrectionFactor  = 1000.0;
  double B = E[2] - (this->Distance / nearDistanceCorrectionFactor);//E[2]
- .1;//this->ClippingRange[0];



with

  // Front (aka near)
  double F = E[2] - 10000.0;//this->ClippingRange[1];
  // Back (aka far)
  double B = E[2] - .1;//this->ClippingRange[0];



The third problem can be fixed by commenting out this line in
VTK/Rendering/OpenGL2/vtkOpenGLPolyDataMapper.cxx (around line 1198 in 5.1,
1416 in 5.2 to 5.4):

"  if (cameraParallel == 0 && dot(normalVCVSOutput,vertexVC.xyz) > 0.0) {
normalVCVSOutput = -1.0*normalVCVSOutput; }"


I hope these fixes help some of you out there get your CAVE updated to the
latest ParaView.

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview crashes when using point gaussian
Message-ID: <CAN1ry7umgnD=+r9TmUzQZaGP4NuqpQMCC4iB=VQpvE60HkiThg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I am uploading 2 cases files to paraview that are correctly uploaded as far
as I can see. I can see the data and apply any filters I want, however when
I choose a Point Gaussian representation, paraview crashes and it closes.

Anyone has an idea what might cause it?

I send attached the case files, but I have already done simulations where
the exit case files are the same and no problem is seen.

Best regards,

Gabriel Nahas

Dear Gabriel

I can't access the files :
"
The page isn?t redirecting properly

Firefox has detected that the server is redirecting the request for this
address in a way that will never complete.

    This problem can sometimes be caused by disabling or refusing to accept
cookies.

Dear Mikhaylov

Could you share your dataset ?
In any case a finely tuned Cylindrical Clip could do the trick.

To: Sebastien Jourdain <sebastien.jourdain at kitware.com>


Dear Sebastien,

Thanks for you response.

I'm trying a different ways for configuring paraviewweb as a web service.

Now I have Ubuntu Desktop 16.04 and followed the tutorial link
https://kitware.github.io/paraviewweb/docs/ubuntu_14_04.html .

Following the steps I end up with error about WebSockets -> WebSocket
connect to 'ws://localhost/ws' failed.

I've used Paraview 5.2 and 5.4 versions.

After long hours research I didn't find any answer for me.

Could you please help to understand what cause this problem: Ubuntu
version, Paraview version or configurations.

Thanks in advance,
Hayk

Dear Gabril,

I can open the case file you sent but it looks like there are some missing
files to open the full dataset.
With the loaded data, the Point Gaussian representation works well on my
computer.
Does the representation crash only for this dataset? Does it crash with
another source?

Did you get any error or feedback in the various logs? Moreover, which URL
did you use to connect and what launcher and apache configuration did you
use?

No, there is not any error logs in log files, just one that I wrote I see
in the browser console. Please find in attachments the config files.

I'm using http://localhost/visualizer or http://localhost/lightviz. BTW
lightviz is showing a black page with 2 icons in the top left, and there is
not errors. The error appears on visualizer.

Thanks,
Hayk

Hello all,

short question: I have an unstructured grid where I want to extract
cells from. I know the IDs of the cells. Is there an easy way to do and
script that? Thanks.

Hi Ben,

I finally got all the dependencies in and built Paraview from the source 
with the debug options on our CentOS 7 machine. Paraview still segfaults, 
and, loading the core file in gdb, below is the backtrace. If you see 
anything of interest, I'd be keen to know it.

Program terminated with signal 11, Segmentation fault.

Hi bastil,

This can be achieved through running a query (Edit > Find Data) on
your data using the criteria "is one of" where you can specify
multiple separated cell ids by a comma(,). After selecting the cells
the Extract Selection filter will extract a set of them.

Thanks,
yoshimi

Hi Martin,

Do you know which graphics card and OpenGL driver you're using?  Given that
it works with the --mesa option I suspect ParaView is hitting an issue with
your OpenGL stack.  Some versions of the binary AMD/ATI driver on Linux
have known bugs in them that cause ParaView to segfault, for instance.

Subject: [Paraview] Using python IDLE 3.6 with VTK and paraview.simple
Message-ID: <DEA101B66315B941B487EAE03CFFF44346437FAE@V-EXC-C02.DIRECTORY.INTRA>


Dear all,

I would like to use paraview.simple with python 3.6 and IDLE. Currently when I import the library this is what I get:

>>> import paraview.simple
Error: Could not import vtkCommonComputationalGeometry
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\Program Files\ParaView 5.2.0-Qt4-OpenGL2-Windows-64bit\bin\Lib\site-packages\paraview\vtk\vtkCommonCore.py", line 5, in <module>
    from .vtkCommonCorePython import *
ImportError: dynamic module does not define module export function (PyInit_vtkCommonCorePython)

During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<pyshell#72>", line 1, in <module>
    import paraview.simple
  File "C:\Program Files\ParaView 5.2.0-Qt4-OpenGL2-Windows-64bit\bin\Lib\site-packages\paraview\simple.py", line 43, in <module>
    from paraview import servermanager

    from vtkCommonCorePython import *
ImportError: dynamic module does not define module export function (PyInit_vtkCommonCorePython)

It appears that the module is defined but it has trouble with some of the VTK submodules. I tried to import VTK on its own but since the modules inside make use of the old print statement (no parentheses) there is not a way to do this free from error. How do I get this stuff to import properly?

Thanks,

The ParaView binaries only support Python2. If you want Python3 support,
you'll need to compile ParaView yourself (unfortunately, the superbuild
is not set up to do this yet, so anything in there you need will need to
be managed manually). We do test ParaView with Python3 though, so it
should work once you have a Python3-compatible build.

Generally you want to scale objects appropriately - almost all of the
library I used / wrote do that (except paraview). If the object is too
small you will have very large eye separation and it is too big, very
small.

You want to scale object according to your screen size so that it can fit
there if placed at focal distance from the camera.

We talked about supporting auto-scaling in paraview but ran out of funding.

Let us know how should be proceed and I happy to help.

Subject: [Paraview] Reading files in Parallel with ParaView
Message-ID: <2F8BA25CC0B82C4DB6756F8F663E6DB35BF3F4AD@CITESMBX3.ad.uillinois.edu>

Hi All,

What is the best way to read a large dataset? I am performing parallel computations, so the mesh is broken into multiple smaller pieces, but it is also possible to re-assemble these pieces into one large piece in a post-processing step.

The results could also be stored in multiple files corresponding to different time steps, or in one big file containing all the time steps. So it is possible to decompose in space and/or time.

Does ParaView read data in parallel regardless of whether the file is decomposed in space and/or time? Would it be faster to read decomposed files vs. reading one large file?

Any ideas?

Thanks very much,

Message-ID: <DEA101B66315B941B487EAE03CFFF44346438164@V-EXC-C02.DIRECTORY.INTRA>

Dear all,

I would like to bring attention to the following thread (http://public.kitware.com/pipermail/paraview/2014-June/031517.html). I am experiencing the exact same problem. It seems like this error is recurrent whether the dll bin directory is included in PYTHONPATH and system PATH or not:

Python 2.7.3 (default, Apr 10 2012, 23:24:47) [MSC v.1500 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
Type "copyright", "credits" or "license()" for more information.
>>> import paraview.simple
Error: Could not import vtkCommonComputationalGeometryPython

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<pyshell#0>", line 1, in <module>
    import paraview.simple
  File "C:\Program Files\ParaView 5.0.1\lib\paraview-5.0\site-packages\paraview\simple.py", line 39, in <module>
    import servermanager
  File "C:\Program Files\ParaView 5.0.1\lib\paraview-5.0\site-packages\paraview\servermanager.py", line 48, in <module>

    from vtkCommonCorePython import *
ImportError: DLL load failed: The specified module could not be found.
>>>

The link provided shows a work-around which works for me. Namely:

>>> import os
>>> os.chdir(r'C:\Program Files\ParaView 5.0.1\bin')
>>> import paraview.simple

Although this works it would be good to determine the underlying reason why the regular method does not. Again I am including the bin directory in both pythonpath and system environment path as proven by the following:

>>> string = r'C:\Program Files\ParaView 5.0.1\bin'
>>> string in os.environ["PATH"]
True
>>> string in sys.path
True

I also tried to track down the user who was facing a similar problem back in 2014 (livia.barazzetti at istb.unibe.ch) to see if she ended up figuring out the solution. Unfortunately her name is not in the mailing list anymore which to me implies she is either not a user anymore or has become so proficient that she doesn't use the mailing list anymore.

Thanks for your consideration and look forward to hearing from you.

Subject: [Paraview] Opacity transfer function in pvpython
Message-ID: <73C93799-7CF6-4D39-84CD-B0E24B7EDB4B@ultrahaptics.com>

Hi,

I?m currently working on a tool that generates Python scripts which, in turn, save a ParaView state. The state can then be loaded in ParaView.

I am experiencing some issues with setting up the LUT for volume rendering of some data. (I?ve already reported one issue that I?m pretty sure is a bug at https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/issues/17616 )

I am able to set the color transfer function and opacity transfer function, and both appear in the UI. However, while the color transfer function works, the opacity transfer function seems to have no effect on rendering whatsoever. After loading the state in ParaView, I can set the entire opacity transfer function to zero and the renderered volume remains completely opaque.

Here?s an example of the Python code I am using:

soundfield = OpenDataFile('my_data.vti')
representation = Show(soundfield)
representation.ColorArrayName = 'ImageScalars'
representation.Representation = 'Volume'
representation.LookupTable = AssignLookupTable(soundfield.PointData['ImageScalars'], 'Cool to Warm')
representation.LookupTable.ScalarOpacityFunction = CreatePiecewiseFunction(Points=[0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.0])
SaveState('state.pvsm')

Is there anything special I have to do? I?ve looked over the documentation/mailing lists/ListProperties() and I can?t see anything obvious.

Thanks,
Ross

Message-ID: <DEA101B66315B941B487EAE03CFFF443464381BB@V-EXC-C02.DIRECTORY.INTRA>

Dear all,

I am trying to control Paraview application using an external python IDE (IDLE). The objective is to send commands using Paraview.simple modules from IDLE and see the changes take place in the Paraview GUI. I cannot use the python shell in Paraview because I seek to use other unrelated libraries so would prefer not to be bound to the shell in Paraview.

So far, I have succeeded in importing the Paraview modules (simple, servermanager...etc) from IDLE. I accomplished this thanks to a 2014 thread (http://public.kitware.com/pipermail/paraview/2014-June/031517.html) using the following commands in IDLE:

>>> import os
>>> os.chdir(r'C:\Program Files\ParaView 5.0.1\bin')
>>> import paraview.simple
>>> os.chdir(r'D:\TEMP\Myfolder')

I attempted some of the examples in the Paraview docs online. For instance:

>>> from paraview.simple import *
>>> cone = Cone()
>>> Show()
>>> Render()

Fortunately, this does indeed create a cone and output it to a new window (OpenGL). Unfortunately this is not what I am trying to do. I need to be able to render it in the Paraview program.

Beyond this simple example I will also eventually need to load in vtk legacy timeseries into Paraview, change some of their visualization parameters and then export several animations. It would be great if I could achieve this from a simple IDLE terminal.

Please let me know if this is even possible? If so am I on the right track? What are the options missing for me to be able to do this ?

Subject: [Paraview] time dependent temperature plot ??
Message-ID: <CAPca1TwyaW3JemWwnPWm6VHOcL-wtQ_52B1NGDbe0GFD1sn8=w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I am analysing heat transfer in solid bodies (walls). I used simscale for
modelling and running the simulation and I am using ParaView for the
post-processing.

I have applied a varying temperature on the surface of the wall and I used
plot over line filter to get the plot but in that, I am getting a plot of
temperature v/s distance, what I was expected was temperature v /s time. I
have tried plot global variable over time and plot selection over time I am
not getting any plots in that. I don?t know where I am going wrong with
ParaView

And if I want to see the node points number/temperature on the geometry and
to extract them where should I go ??

And when I open the ParaView application I am getting an output message
like UNABLE TO DISABLE THE ROTATION, (:0,)

So Can any one please help me with this


I have attached the case.pvd files below


thanks in advance

Just focusing on this question to begin with, when you say you want to plot
temperature over time. Temperature of what? Each of the case.pvd seems to
have multiple blocks of data. Do you want to plot the average temperature
of the whole dataset or a particular block? or max temperature at each
timestep or something else?

Hi Ross,

Specifying representation.ScalarOpacityFunction via the same piecewise
function may be also needed:
representation.ScalarOpacityFunction =
CreatePiecewiseFunction(Points=[0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.5,
0.0])

Thanks,
yoshimi

However, while the color transfer function works, the opacity transfer function seems to have no effect on rendering whatsoever. After loading the state in ParaView, I can set the entire opacity transfer function to zero and the renderered volume remains completely opaque.

Hi,

I am trying to build ParaView 5.4.0 from source so I can use the Superquadric plugin and am running into a problem that appears to be related to Qt and ffmpeg.  At the end of the log output from 'Make', I see the following:

Both Qt and ffmpeg seemed to have installed correctly, and when I set up the configuration for ParaView, I didn't see any issues related to either one.  Any thoughts on how I resolve this?  Apologies as I am not well-versed at building software in Linux.

Thanks,
Chris

Subject: [Paraview] Point data to 2d plane data
Message-ID: <81A18720EB4BBA489B6552676D14533C67BE25EC@chimbx4.ad.uillinois.edu>

Dear Paraview developers,

I have a question about how to convert point data (vtk file) to 2d plane data. Actually, originally, I was working with vtk file. Then I use the extract selection to select some cells in the original model. In order to process the data of the selected cells, I save the data as the csv file. Then I use Matlab to do some calculation on the data in the csv file. After that, I open the modified csv file by using Paraview directly. And now, I only have spreadsheet view. After searching some online information, I use TabletoPoint to convert the data to point data. However, I still want to view them as the 2d cell. So I use point interpolation to try to convert the points data to 2d plane cell data. However, It doesn't work.

So my question is, how to show the data value in the space between different 2d points data by using point interpolation? Or is there any way that I can process the original data in the 2d cell plane mode without saving it as the csv file?

Best,
Teng Li

Hi yoshimi,

Thanks ? your suggestion helped me find a solution:


opacity_map = CreatePiecewiseFunction(Points=[44.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 132.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 154.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.0]) 
representation.LookupTable.ScalarOpacityFunction = opacity_map
representation.ScalarOpacityFunction = opacity_map

I believe what?s going on here is that the LookupTable editor in ParaView gets its data from LookupTable.ScalarOpacityFunction, while the renderer gets it from representation.ScalarOpacityFunction. If they?re both initialised separately, updating the opacity mapping in the colour map editor does not cause the rendering to update. If they both reference the same object, it works as expected.

Hi Louis,

Does ParaView read data in parallel regardless of whether the file is

Space, yes.  Time, not really, at least not without writing a custom reader.

This is something that will be dependent on the file format yuou're using.
It will most certainly be faster to read the data in parallel, spatially
decomposed, and most of the parallel readers support an N -> M IO mapping,
that is, using a different number of readers than there are spatial
partitions.  As to using one big file or not, well, some parallel file
formats support it, some dont.  Just make sure you use a file format that
supports the spatial decomposition, whether thats as one file per
partition-timestep, one file per-timestep with multiple partitions per
file, or everything in one file with multiple partitions adn timesteps per
file.  Your bottlenext in IO will likely be the write time anyways and as
long as the file format your using supports parallel reads then how that's
laid out, whether in a single file or multiple files, will probably not
have a significant impact.

What if you try this:

Does that work?

In case anyone finds this useful, I also found a solution to a related problem.

Once I extended the previous code to import multiple VTIs, editing the colour/opacity mapping broke again. I could only get it to affect either one of the imageDatas, or all of them simultaneously.

I eventually discovered that this was due to the default name of the scalar points in imageDatas being hardcoded to ?ImagesScalars? in VTK. ParaView apparently assumes that they should all have the same colour/opacity maps as a result. I just added 

imageData->GetPointData()->GetScalars()->SetName(?ImageScalars? + std::to_string(index)).c_str());

to my export code, which seems to have fixed it.

    Hi yoshimi,
    
    Thanks ? your suggestion helped me find a solution:
    
    
    opacity_map = CreatePiecewiseFunction(Points=[44.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 132.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 154.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.0]) 
    representation.LookupTable.ScalarOpacityFunction = opacity_map
    representation.ScalarOpacityFunction = opacity_map
    
    I believe what?s going on here is that the LookupTable editor in ParaView gets its data from LookupTable.ScalarOpacityFunction, while the renderer gets it from representation.ScalarOpacityFunction. If they?re both initialised separately, updating the opacity mapping in the colour map editor does not cause the rendering to update. If they both reference the same object, it works as expected.

Subject: [Paraview] MPI on multiple nodes
Message-ID: <F343C469-F370-4038-96F1-638B5626E4AF@gmail.com>

Hi, 

I would like to ask about running pvserver in parallel with MPI on multiple hosts. Is that possible?

 

The following commands were tested successfully:

1)       Running MPI on localhost:

mpiexec ?n M localhost pvserver

2)       Running MPI on remotehost:

mpiexec ?host remotehost ?n M pvserver

 

But I was not able to run: mpiexec ?hosts 2 localhost 1 remotehost 1 pvserver

I run the following to test MPI on multiple hosts and it worked: mpiexec ?hosts 2 localhost 1 remotehost 1 hostname

 

Is there any pre-configuration that should be done to pvserver? I want the clients to connect to the server (master server), and the jobs are distributed across multiple nodes.

 

Regards,

Mariam

Message-ID: <CAE=GJrbQf9PW9Jz8nn3zufLvDj0BCzH2qgC-a3zV52CnHOAheg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi!

I would like to know the steps in order to run simple example like the
following one:

https://kitware.github.io/paraviewweb/examples/Composite/index.html

It doesn't need to be a really elaborated tutorial, but a simple one with
the main things.
I have little to no background in web development.

What I managed to do so far was to create my own project and add
paraviewweb to it like its described in
https://kitware.github.io/paraviewweb/docs/setup.html .

I don't know what to do next but I believe that a great start would be to
know where to put the source code in the example and how to run it.

Thanks in advance,

Based on the path given in the setup guide, you should copy the example you
want to reproduce inside ${ROOT}/src/* where the main example file should
be named index.js.

Then you should be able to build your example using the npm command: "npm
run build".

Maybe the vtk.js explanation might be easier to follow (
https://kitware.github.io/vtk-js/docs/intro_vtk_as_es6_dependency.html),
but the concept is exactly the same.
As it is picking the example available here
https://kitware.github.io/vtk-js/examples/Cone.html |
https://github.com/Kitware/vtk-js/tree/master/Examples/WebGL/Cone
and making a standalone application from it.

Just be aware that vtk.js is using webpack2 which is not the case for
ParaViewWeb.

Hope that helps,

Seb

Message-ID: <SN2PR0701MB7847F8F480ACAF325FB09799FBB0@SN2PR0701MB784.namprd07.prod.outlook.com>

All,

So, I have a multi-block dataset (Exodus).   Within each block, I have sets of 360 elements which have a common index.   So, in Block 1, elements 0-359 have a cell variable called N_RING, which is 1.    Elements 360-719, have N_RING=2, etc.

What I really want is the ability to operate on these sets.   Imagine I have an element variable called Ying, which is different for each element in the model.  I would like every element with N_RING=1 to have an element variable of Ying_max assigned, which is the maximum value of Ying for any element with N_RING=1.    So, for example,  elements 0-359 would be assigned a value of Ying_max which is the maximum value of Ying in any of elements 0-359.   Elements 360-719 would be assigned a value of Ying_max which is the maximum value for any element with N_RING=2.    I would ideally also like to get min and average.

Is there any way to get max/min/average of a group consisting of a cell variable index?  - and to assign the output as element variables so I can color by?

Thanks for any hints.

Dennis

Hello,

I am trying to monitor the progress of a paraview filter (contour)
on rather large data, so that I could  predict when it will finish.
Is there a recommended way to do this? I am running using
42 paraview servers and I cannot find an easy way of estimating
the filter percent of progress or expected completion time.

Thanks,

Joe

Hello,everyone.


When I use the tiled-display mode with one RenderView, the image can be correctly displayed.


But if I open another horizontal or vertical RenderView, the result will go wrong.


For instance, one of these tiles will be invisible. And the image's sequence is incorrect,and we can only get two fragmentary images.


Shall we reconfigure our MPI machinefile?

This is indeed a bug (

Message-ID: <CAAGOGw9TH--UXetQpbVUoa9eKKoNB6zfiOsdgN0kK7av-YVNkQ@mail.gmail.com>

Colleagues:

Has anyone else had problems rendering with "Volume" representation with
the as-distributed ParaView 5.4.0 (on OS X 10.11.6)?  When I select that
representation and "Yes" to the box regarding possibly taking a while, I
have only a white/blank Render View.  This is the case regardless of
coloring, colormap, or lighting options. Sometimes if I rotate the view,
I'll see a pseudo-surface representation, but when I stop I return to a
fully white render view.

In 5.4.0, I create the Volume by first Tetrahedraliz'ing my data set and
then selecting Volume representation.  Conversely, if I load the same data
in 5.2.0 and select Volume directly, it plots as I would expect.  If I try
to do the same in 5.3.0, it hangs on the render (status bar at the bottom
gets ~80% of the way and doesn't appear to proceed further).

Note that if I plot the same data in VisIt, it shows a Volume as I would
expect and quickly enough that I don't believe impatience to be my issue
(the data set is relatively small).

Any thoughts are appreciated.

Please contact me with any comments, questions, or concerns.

Thank you,
Joel

I think the syntax for mpiexec is:

mpiexec -np 8 --host host_one,host_two pvserver

This would launch 4 occurences of pvserver on host_one and 4 on host_two.

1) first check mpi is running:

mpiexec -np 2 --host host_one,host_two hostname

This should print the name of the 2 hosts.

If it does not works check you can ssh from one host to the other without password.

2) You need the same paraview/pvserver install on the two hosts in the same 
location (not imposed but it is easier to launch)

3) May be use reverse connection from the parallel pvserver to the paraview 
client when you launch pvserver

Joel,

This is a known issue that we have not yet resolved:
https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/issues/17303

As a workaround, you can try a different volume rendering algorithm (Select
Mapper property in the Properties panel) such as "Z Sweep", "Bunyk ray
cast", or "Resample to Image".

HTH,
Cory

Cory,

Excellent, thanks, the workarounds got me going.  Sorry I didn't think to
search the tickets.

Joe,

I am afraid there's no easy answer for this. In fact, in ParaView, we don't
collect progress from ranks other than the root.

Subject: [Paraview] Point data to 2d plane data
Message-ID: <81A18720EB4BBA489B6552676D14533C67BE2E13@chimbx4.ad.uillinois.edu>

Dear Paraview developers,

I have a question about how to convert point data (vtk file) to 2d plane data. Actually, originally, I was working with vtk file. Then I use the extract selection to select some cells in the original model. In order to process the data of the selected cells, I save the data as the csv file. Then I use Matlab to do some calculation on the data in the csv file. After that, I open the modified csv file by using Paraview directly. And now, I can only see this csv file in spreadsheet view. After searching some online information, I use TabletoPoint to convert the data to point data. However, I still want to view them as the 2d cell. So I use point interpolation to try to convert the points data to 2d plane cell data. However, It doesn't work.

So my question is, how to show the data value in the space between different 2d points data by using point interpolation? Or is there any way that I can process the 2d cell plane data without saving it as the csv file?

Best,
Teng Li

Hello,

      I want to know if I can use paraview to visualize molecule dataset, i.e., using ball-and-stick model to represent molecules? Currently I can only using point gaussian to represent the "ball", but I don't know how to visualize the "stick". I know another visualization tool VMD is designed to do works of this kind, but I've not found similar founctions in ParaView.

Zhang,

Yes, you can visualize molecules in ball-and-stick representation in
ParaView (see attached). This representation is used whenever you load
a vtkMolecule data type. If you have a PDB file, for example, it will
be read in as a vtkMolecule data type and displayed with
ball-and-stick representation by default. You can also change the
Molecule "Render Mode" property to "Space Filling" or "Liquorice"
representation.

HTH,
Cory

Teng,

When you saved your data to a csv file, you lost all cell information. If you want to look at cells in your data, you will have to recreate them.

The easiest way to create cells is probably to use the Delaunay 2D filter. Note, however, that the cells created will not be the same as in your original vtk file.

If you want to keep your original cells, you will have to save them in a file that supports cell topology. One way to do that is when you save your csv file, also save a vtk file of the same data. Then, after you have run Matlab, load both the csv file and the vtk file. Do the TableToPoints on the csv data as before. Then use append attributes to copy the csv data to the vtk cell data.

Thank you, but I have ParaView build with OSMesa without X. If I run
program with Catalyst(genereted script from ParaView, with render views) on
cluster with mpi, ussually one render view will show, but on anothers
process it crash with this error: ERROR: In
.../ParaView-v5.4.0/VTK/Rendering/OpenGL2/vtkOpenGLRenderWindow.cxx, line
819
vtkXOpenGLRenderWindow (0x3f7cbf0): GLEW could not be initialized. I have
the same error with pvserver with or without --use-offscreen-rendering or
without pvserver.

If i run Catalyst with script only for live visualization then the program
go without problem but i dont get pictures which i want. Is there some
posibility how fix the error or how to get pictures(with offscreen
rendering)?

It sounds like you didn't properly build with OSMesa. If you share your
CMakeCache.txt from your ParaView build I can see if I can track down the
problem.

Best,
Andy

Thanks for your reply.

The correct syntax to run on multiple hosts is: mpiexec ?hosts N localhost M remotehost 1 appName

I tested with hostname and it worked; it printed the expected output.

 

However, by executing the same command with pvserver, it does not work. I ensured the location of paraview/pvserver is the same across both hosts. And I am providing the full path of pvserver.

 

I would like to make sure that I understood the concept correctly:

>From host1, if I executed parallel pvservers with MPI (host1, host2, hostN), the clients should connect to host1. 

 

Can you please confirm?

Subject: Re: [Paraview] MPI on multiple nodes

 

I think the syntax for mpiexec is:

mpiexec -np 8 --host host_one,host_two pvserver

This would launch 4 occurences of pvserver on host_one and 4 on host_two.

1) first check mpi is running:

mpiexec -np 2 --host host_one,host_two hostname

This should print the name of the 2 hosts.

If it does not works check you can ssh from one host to the other without password.

2) You need the same paraview/pvserver install on the two hosts in the same location (not imposed but it is easier to launch)

3) May be use reverse connection from the parallel pvserver to the paraview client when you launch pvserver

Hi, 

I would like to ask about running pvserver in parallel with MPI on multiple hosts. Is that possible?

 

The following commands were tested successfully:

1)      Running MPI on localhost:

mpiexec ?n M localhost pvserver

2)      Running MPI on remotehost:

mpiexec ?host remotehost ?n M pvserver

 

But I was not able to run: mpiexec ?hosts 2 localhost 1 remotehost 1 pvserver

I run the following to test MPI on multiple hosts and it worked: mpiexec ?hosts 2 localhost 1 remotehost 1 hostname

 

Is there any pre-configuration that should be done to pvserver? I want the clients to connect to the server (master server), and the jobs are distributed across multiple nodes.

 

Regards,

Mariam

I'm sorry but the syntax you want to use doesn't work on my servers. So I cannot 
help.
With the one I suggest I'm running 360 pvserver processes this morning to 
visualize a large dataset on a cluster. May be you should try it.

Yesterday, I tried the syntax you provided me, but it didn't work.
So I am thinking if there is anything that I should preconfigure.

Are you using it with reverse connection?

Thanks,

Hi! Guys,

this error was found before, do you remember how to solve it? I am building
ParaView with CMake and I need to start a trace, but pvpython does not work

collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
CommandLineExecutables/CMakeFiles/pvpython.dir/build.make:128: recipe for
target 'bin/pvpython' failed
make[2]: *** [bin/pvpython] Error 1

make[1]: *** [CommandLineExecutables/CMakeFiles/pvpython.dir/all] Error 2
Makefile:116: recipe for target 'all' failed
make: *** [all] Error 2

thanks Jose

Hi Jose,

The real error is higher up in your build log, that is just make's output
that something failed.  It looks like the pvpython executable failed to
link, so you need to scroll back and look for the link error.

HTH,
Shawn

The syntax for specifying what ranks run on which hosts is implementation
specific and will be specified differently for OpenMPI, MPICH, MVAPICH2,
IntelMPI, etc.  It will also depend on the environment you're running it in
and how it';s configured, i.e. are you running mpiexec inside a job
launched by a scheduler or are you manually configuring MPI, using tcp
everywhere, are you using host or machine files, etc.  All of these things
are going to be implementation specific.  Please consult the documentation
for the system you're using or the specific MPI implementation you're using
for the appropriate syntax to use, as it will be different for different
people, machines, environments, and configurations.


But I was not able to run: mpiexec ?hosts 2 localhost 1 remotehost 1

Hi Jose,

Please keep the list in the conversation so that others can chime in too
(and/or find the solution in the future).  I'm not sure why pvpython is
even linking to Qt.  As far as I know it shouldn't be.  If you want to
re-send your error to the list, someone may be able to help.

HTH,

Thanks for your reply Chuck.

I am using Microsoft MPI which I believe it has MPICH basis.

 

I created a small LAN network for testing, both running Windows 10, and ParaView is installed on the same path, firewall is turned off.

I was running MPIEXEC manually from one of the machines using this command: mpiexec ?hosts 2 localhost 1 remotehost 1 pvserver

 

By doing that, no errors where received but it seems the connection has not been established. I should get a message like the following:

Waiting for client...

Connection URL: cs://PC.local:11111

Accepting connection(s): PC.local:11111

 

But nothing has been received, and even no messages on SMPD console. I tried to forcefully connect the ParaView client to the server in this state, but I got a message that the socket is not open.

 

>From the localhost, I tried to run pvserver on the remotehost and this has been successfully executed: mpiexec ?host remotehost ?n M pvserver

 

Apologies,

This is my first time to work with MPI, appreciate your help & support. I could not troubleshoot since there were no messages/ indications to resolve the issue.

 

Thanks again!

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView 5.4.1-RC2 available for download
Message-ID: <CAB5Fpx5+Bf5n132GHS8zVE4-_hmJg++kZJBjjKOkYDyjZMGTRg@mail.gmail.com>

On behalf of the ParaView development team, I am happy to announce
that ParaView 5.4.1-RC2 is available for download. Binaries and source
code are available from

www.paraview.org/download

Note that ParaView 5.4.1-RC1 had a critical bug that was identified
and resolved internally before binaries and source code were made
available for download, so we have skipped straight to RC2.

The 5.4.1-RC2 bug fix release addresses a number of problems, including:

* The black render window observed on some systems when FXAA was
enabled or an object's opacity was less than 1 has been fixed.

* Field output for cells with non-straight edges has been corrected.

* Derivatives for quadratic triangles are now computed correctly.

* A bug that occurred when generating a Catalyst script with no images
output has been fixed.

* A problem with writing animations as AVIs was fixed.

* Logic in the CGNS reader was updated to correctly read all solution
nodes for each centering type when FlowSolutionPointers are missing.

* Fixed crash in CGNS reader when moving forward in time.

* Fixed problem with long-running animations not advancing past a
certain number of time steps.

* Resolved issue where changing one file path in the state file loader
"Choose File Names" dialog also changed the file paths of other files
with the same type.

* Addressed problem with enumerated property dependencies in ParaViewWeb.

* Added ability to change the font size in the ParaView user interface.

* Fixed BoxLib3D file reader.

* State files now properly support files with relative paths.

* Removed inappropriate scalar bar scaling when saving large screen shots.

Please report any problems you find with this release candidate on the
mailing list or on the bug tracker at
https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/issues

- Cory

It's still unclear to me what you want when you save "across the wall"
and v/s time. Across in which direction? So attached is state that
generates the plot for max temperature of the data over time. Hope
that gets you started. The state was generated with 5.4.1-RC2. You can
download the binaries from paraview.org.

Change the "Python Calculator" expression to `min` or `mean` instead
of `max` and you'll be plotting that curve.

Not sure where that is coming from. Do you still get it with 5.4.1-RC2 binaries?

I think what you're missing is -DVTK_USE_X=OFF and probably
-DVTK_USE_OFFSCREEN=ON. If that doesn't work, please send your
CMakeCache.txt from your build directory.

Hi All,

Is it possible to suppress the printing of errors when using pvpython?

I am getting this error:

ERROR: In /projects/pvdev/common/pv-source/v4.3.1/VTK/Common/DataModel/vtkTriQuadraticHexahedron.cxx, line 231
vtkTriQuadraticHexahedron (0x294372c0): Newton did not converged, iteration 10 det -0.0262359

many times over every time the time step is incremented and streamlines are re-computed. I am not so much worried that the streamlines are not converging, but the error messages are flooding the output window.

Any advice would be very much appreciated.

Thanks very much,

Kitware - Ping?

All,

So, I have a multi-block dataset (Exodus).   Within each block, I have sets of 360 elements which have a common index.   So, in Block 1, elements 0-359 have a cell variable called N_RING, which is 1.    Elements 360-719, have N_RING=2, etc.

What I really want is the ability to operate on these sets.   Imagine I have an element variable called Ying, which is different for each element in the model.  I would like every element with N_RING=1 to have an element variable of Ying_max assigned, which is the maximum value of Ying for any element with N_RING=1.    So, for example,  elements 0-359 would be assigned a value of Ying_max which is the maximum value of Ying in any of elements 0-359.   Elements 360-719 would be assigned a value of Ying_max which is the maximum value for any element with N_RING=2.    I would ideally also like to get min and average.

Is there any way to get max/min/average of a group consisting of a cell variable index?  - and to assign the output as element variables so I can color by?

Thanks for any hints.

Dennis
