Between 3.98 and 4.0 the syntax of the option to turn off MPI4PY changes
like so:
I recommend staying with 4.0, but try reverting this change if you need
3.98 for some reason.

Subject: [Paraview] Merging very close Points
Message-ID: <CAHDyfPDv7r68g=7PTX8i0tiUM0u3UGaBvLq3LsPRdGXqpWburA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I want to merge the very close (or coincident) points in PV. For instance,
there are very close two points and one point apart from them, i.e., an
ASCII VTK File:
----------
vtk output
ASCII
DATASET UNSTRUCTURED_GRID
POINTS 3 float
1 1 1
0 0 0
0 0 1e-014
CELLS 3 6
1 0
1 1
1 2
CELL_TYPES 3
1
1
1
----------
I use the Clean to Grid filter to merge the two close points, but after
that there remains three points.  Can anyone tell me what this is?

Thanks,
yoshimi

Hi Yoshimi,

The Clean to Grid filter internally invokes vtkCleanUnstructuredGrid
which can merge duplicate points, but they need to have coincident
coordinates. In contrast, very old versions of ParaView also merged very
close points, but that is not true any more, see closed issue
http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=9728

It is actually very simple to derive a (c++-based) plugin from
vtkCleanUnstructuredGrid that provides a filter that merges points
within a distance of less than a (configurable) fraction of the length
of the diagonal of the bounding box of the data set. But in order to be
able to use said plugin you would need to compile ParaView from source.
Not sure whether you would want to go to such lengths.

Sven

Thank you Sven,

I follow your advice, in vtkCleanUnstructuredGrid, I replace vtkMergePoints
locator  by vtkPointLocator. Hereby, I am able to specify the tolerance to
merge points, and get the desired results.

Thank you very much.

Subject: [Paraview] Annotate Time Filter
Message-ID: <CA+ze5C7uLMZYhzzpmUip944D6s-qfHU8ambyWRL7Sp4=Wu5AJg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I have a question about AnnotateTimeFilter. I have a Data Set ( h5 files)
containing several time steps that I open with PFlotran Reader.

If i first merge these files and then open them as a single file using the
PFlotran Reader, then the Annotate Time Filter works correctly.

But, if I just open one of these h5 files containing just one time step,
then
the Annotate Time Filter doesn?t work correctly and just shows Time=0


I am trying to get pictures opening just single files, but I want to show
the time correctly.

Is there anyway to be able to make AnnotateTimeFilter show times correctly?

Thanks

The time info is written in the .pvd file, if you load the pvd file, the 
Annotate Time Filter works correctly.
If you load only a pvtu file the Annotate Time Filtershows Time=0.
Hope this helps,

Subject: [Paraview] Changing the Color Map / Transfer Function during
	Animation
Message-ID: <52260B75.8060408@ucdavis.edu>

Hello,

Is there a way to elegantly update the Color Mapping of a dataset (I.E., 
change the opacity values of the scalar component for a range of scalar 
values in a volume render animation) using the animation tool? The 
closest I've gotten is to threshold the dataset by a certain range per 
time-step and then volume render that subset but the problem with this 
is that unstructured grid volume rendering is very slow and expensive.

Thanks,
Jesus Pulido

Message-ID: <1E0F760D-E173-4C71-825E-BC394801950F@bluequartz.net>

I have a surface mesh that I am reading through an XDMF file. After reading I apply a threshold and then a glyph filter to show cubes at each point. The SurfaceMesh is a "3D" volume and the result from OS X is exactly what I would expect. The result in windows is however not correct at all from the looks of it. The windows version seems to be only getting data from the first 1% in the Z Direction. I posted a pair of images that show the issue.

OS X result:
http://www.bluequartz.net/binaries/OSX_401.png

Windows Result:
http://www.bluequartz.net/binaries/Windows_401.png

Has anyone ever seen this type of behavior? I can also provide the XDMF and HDF5 files if they are needed.

Thanks

Mike,

Can you send the data? I am not too surprised, the random logic in
that filters often seemed fishy to me.

Hi all,

is it possible to create animation output in WebM format with Paraview?
Right now, I first create an Ogg/Vorbis file and convert to WebM using
avconv, which is somewhat time-consuming.

Cheers,
Nico

Not currently. If someone wants to contribute a WebM writer to VTK,
that'd be great :).

Subject: [Paraview] python wrapping and paraview plugins
Message-ID: <CAOqyOuF26-HsOCRDs0pmd8u=Sga7=noEN=Yq8mkSmZOGCCOK2w@mail.gmail.com>

H,

I saw this thread from July
http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2013-July/028731.html and wanted
to see if there were any updates that could avoid Pat's workaround.

I also have a second error in generating the python wrapped module.

I tried Pat's example project
https://github.com/patmarion/PythonWrappedPluginExample compiled against
the ParaView 4.0.1 release, but I get an additional error that
"vtkPythonArgs.h" can not be found:

/Users/caseygoodlett/common/pv-wrap-test/Module/Filters/vtkMyFilterPython.cxx:5:10:
fatal error: 'vtkPythonArgs.h' file not found
#include "vtkPythonArgs.h"
         ^
1 error generated.
make[2]: ***
[Module/Filters/CMakeFiles/vtkMyFiltersPythonD.dir/vtkMyFilterPython.cxx.o]
Error 1
make[1]: *** [Module/Filters/CMakeFiles/vtkMyFiltersPythonD.dir/all] Error 2
make: *** [all] Error 2

I assume that I need to get ParaView/VTK/Wrapping/PythonCore/ in the
include path.  What is the recommended way to do this?

Thank you

Subject: [Paraview] Seeking help with display hdf5 file in paraview using
	xdmf
Message-ID: <CAOaNLthG5T7ERCg+nboUAOSv9zKt62ST8YDoZ9WRAaMGxhRK_w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All!

I have a technique issue with displaying hdf5 file in paraview.
I have to store a surface into hdf5 file and to display it in paraview.
The surface is made up by base grid triangles and planer graphs on each
basegrid triangle.  The planar graphs in base grid triangle includes points
and edges.
I store the coordinate of the vertex of base grid triangles in
surface.h5:/xbasetrianglecoords
surface.h5:/ybasetrianglecoords
surface.h5:/zbasetrianglecoords
and the coordinate of nodes on planer graphs in
surface.h5:/xnodescoords
surface.h5:/ynodescoords
surface.h5:/znodescoords

If I only need to display the base triangle coords, I would write the xdmf
as
<Geometry GeometryType="X_Y_Z">
<DataItem Dimensions="318" NumberType="Float" Format="HDF">
surface.h5:/xbasetrianglecoords
</DataItem>
<DataItem Dimensions="318" NumberType="Float" Format="HDF">
surface.h5:/ybasetrianglecoords
</DataItem>
<DataItem Dimensions="318" NumberType="Float" Format="HDF">
surface.h5:/zbasetrianglecoords
</DataItem>
</Geometry>

What if I want to display both of them?
I tried to do this:
<Geometry GeometryType="X_Y_Z">
<DataItem Dimensions="1212" NumberType="Float" Format="HDF">
surface.h5:/xbasetrianglecoords
surface.h5:/xnodescoords
</DataItem>
<DataItem Dimensions="1212" NumberType="Float" Format="HDF">
surface.h5:/ybasetrianglecoords
surface.h5:/ynodescoords
</DataItem>
<DataItem Dimensions="1212" NumberType="Float" Format="HDF">
surface.h5:/zbasetrianglecoords
surface.h5:/znodescoords
</DataItem>
</Geometry>

But it does no work. I am wondering if anyone on this list have any
experience with this problem(put 2 hdf5 files in one entry)?

Best,
Xiaoxue

Thanks very much for the info, David. Turning off MPI4PY for version 3.98 as you suggested works for me to build version 3.98 on Titan also with SuperBuild.

I do want to stick with 4.0, but built 3.98 also just in case since my new plugin works well on version 3.98. After some further examination, it looks like my plugin should work on version 4.0 also. Have put my plugin code into 4.0 source directory under both tools and cross subdirectories and hope it can be built and work for version 4.0 also.

Have spent this morning trying to figure out how to turn on some additional flags in superbuild such as my new filter plugin, Fortran coprocessing adaptor, and Phasta adaptor, but cannot succeed. Hope to get some hint on how to do so. Apparently, passing those flags in by adding corresponding -D to configuretools only resulted in CMake warning indicating those manually-specified variables were not used. Have tried to change some cmake files in superbuild, but does not seem to have any effect. Really appreciate any suggestions you can offer here to turn on those additional flags which are important for our coprocessing purposes.

Thanks,

Hong

Between 3.98 and 4.0 the syntax of the option to turn off MPI4PY changes like so:
I recommend staying with 4.0, but try reverting this change if you need 3.98 for some reason.

Just a quick update. Like Mark, I can build ParaView 4.0.1 with Superbuild successfully without issues using CMake 2.8.11.2 on Titan. However, I cannot build Paraview 3.98.1 with Superbuild using the same CMake version. I still got the same linking error from mpi4py.MPI.c in the final stage of linking after 100% built for the cross stage (see below for details) if I built version 3.98.1 using superbuild. Perhaps the latest version of Superbuild has some sort of incompatibility with the older version of ParaView for xk7_gnu target? Anyway, looks like we have to go with the latest ParaView version for in-situ visualization on Titan since superbuild does not work with older 3.98.1 version for us, which may very well prove a good thing for us in the long run due to a lot of improvement made on Catalyst in the latest ParaView version.

Thanks,
Hong

Subject: Re: [Paraview] Building on Titan using ParaViewSuperbuild

Thanks for the info, Mark. Looks like it is sensible for me to try newer version of CMake 2.8.11.2 and see how it goes.

On a somewhat related question: I am trying to pass in some CMake flags to make it build my new filter plugin as well as FortranAdaptor for coprocessing (yes, I discovered also that coprocessing/catalyst is built by default by superbuild, but FortranAdaptor is turned off by default). I tried to pass it in by adding corresponding -D to configuretools, but got CMake warning as well indicating those manually-specified variables were not used. I am wondering whether I can do it by directly changing CMakeCache.txt under paraview/src/paraview-build to force the corresponding flags to be on...

Thanks,

Hi Hong,
I was able to get David's instructions to work using CMake 2.8.11.2 and ParaView 4.0.1. The build process seems to be sensitive to versions.

I tried to follow the instructions and the configuration scripts to build ParaView for compute nodes on Titan. It built successfully without issues for the TOOLS stage, but when doing final linking for paraview in the CROSS stage, I got numerous similar linking error from different lines such as the following:

----------------
/....../ParaView/ParaViewSuperbuild/cross/paraview/src/paraview/Utilities/mpi4py/src/mpi4py.MPI.c: In function '__pyx_pf_6mpi4py_3MPI_4File_54Sync':

----------------

The same error message were raised from the same file mpi4py.MPI.c from different lines.

I am using CMake version 2.8.10.2 which is provided by Titan, and using the ParaView source tree version 3.98 with one additional filter I have developed.

Any idea on what could cause the linking error?

Thanks,
Hong

So coprocessing will not be built using the below instructions? I would have mentioned that, but coprocessing appears to
still be part of a regular, non-cross-compile build, so I figured it was part of ENABLE_paraview

The coprocessing plugin, which adds things to the GUI to make it easy to record coprocessing pipeline setups doesn't need to be turned on since that lives in the client only. (It is like python trace or state recording, but tailored to recording in-situ setups).

Catalyst (the stripped down version of ParaView server that a simulation code can link to and use to run those recorded pipelines quickly) is not yet an option in ParaViewSuperbuild. To cross compile Catalyst a bit more work will be required. It will follow the same plan as how the ParaView server is compiled, but I just haven't tried it. When I did cross compile Catalyst last year at this time I did the same steps that ParaViewSuperbuild's TOOLS and CROSS build passes did, just by hand.
Also, for the below configcross.sh, do we need to pass in a CMake variable telling it where the tools build dir is located?

That should be an option that you can easily set, but it isn't sorry.

 CMake/CrossCompilationMacros.cmake assumes it can find it one directory up and over like so:
macro(find_hosttools)
  set(PARAVIEW_HOSTTOOLS_DIR ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/../tools/paraview/src/paraview-build/ CACHE PATH
    "Location of host built paraview compile tools directory")
  set(PYTHON_HOST_EXE ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/../tools/install/bin/python CACHE PATH
    "Location of host built python executable")
  set(PYTHON_HOST_LIBDIR ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/../tools/install/lib CACHE PATH
    "Location of host built python libraries")
  set(BOOST_HOST_INCLUDEDIR ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/../tools/install/include CACHE PATH
    "Location of host built boost headers")
endmacro()

You could predefine all four of those if you like.

Thanks,
Mark

Hi David,

I just started to try superbuild on Titan also. I don't see you set ENABLE_MPI to be true in your configure script. Could you confirm whether ENABLE_MPI needs to be set to TRUE in order for ParaView to run on Titan in parallel? Since my purpose is to link our

The ENABLE_MPI flag at the Superbuild level is unrelated. It has a purpose only when CROSS_BUILD_STAGE=HOST, that is when making ParaView binary installers for desktops from Superbuild.

You shouldn't turn it on in the TOOLS or CROSS stages. Instead let the CROSS stage use the system installed MPI. It does that by turning PARAVIEW_USE_MPI=ON when it configures the ParaView sub-build. See CMake/crosscompile/xk7_gnu to see where it does that, and to see the other flags it uses.

simulation code (already built statically with CMake on Titan) to ParaView CoProcessing libraries (I am using version 3.98.1) for in-situ visualization on Titan, so in this case, do I have to set ENABLE_paraview to true and do I need to enable OSMesa for ParaView to resort to off-screen rendering for in-situ visualization?

The CROSS stage turns on Python, Mesa and ParaView. Titan's accelerators don't really run X11, so Mesa is the only option for rendering there.

Although I can build ParaView from source on Titan login nodes, I am not able to run it on compute nodes, so I am starting to try superbuild hoping to be able to cross build ParaView libraries to run in-situ visualization on Titan.

I've cross compiled Catalyst itself before on a bluegene. I did it manually before SuperBuild existed. I will see if I can dig up my config scripts. Cross compiling Catalyst should be more or less that same thing as cross compiling ParaView, but a bit faster and easier because their is less code involved.

Thanks,
Hong

Your tools build is pointing to the compiler wrapper that you normally would use to make code for the back end.
The tools build should just use plain old local gcc since we only build things at that point that run on the login node.

Try these setup scripts:
I source configtools.sh to set up my environment before I build the compile tools, and configcross.sh before before I cross compile ParaView.

configtools.sh
#use my own cmake, system one is too old
setenv PATH /autofs/na4_proj/csc035/demarle/pvdev/titan/cmake-build/bin:${PATH}
#switch compiler to compile code for front end
module unload PrgEnv-pgi
module load gcc
#configure settings for to build compile tools only
cmake \
  -DCROSS_BUILD_STAGE:STRING=TOOLS -Dcross_target:STRING=xk7_gnu \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Release \
  -DBUILD_TESTING:BOOL=FALSE \
  -DParaView_FROM_GIT:BOOL=OFF \
  -DENABLE_paraview:BOOL=TRUE \
  -DENABLE_boost:BOOL=TRUE \
  -DENABLE_python:BOOL=TRUE \
  -DENABLE_portfwd:BOOL=FALSE \
  ../../ParaViewSuperbuild


then make

configcross.sh
#use my own cmake, system one is too old
setenv PATH /autofs/na4_proj/csc035/demarle/pvdev/titan/cmake-build/bin:${PATH}
#switch compiler to compile code for back end
module unload PrgEnv-pgi
module unload gcc
module load PrgEnv-gnu
#not sure why module load wasn't sufficient, but ended up needing to force
#cmake to choose the right compiler
setenv CC /opt/cray/xt-asyncpe/5.17/bin/cc
setenv CXX /opt/cray/xt-asyncpe/5.17/bin/CC
#configure settings to cross compile python, (mesa - implied), and paraview
cmake \
  -DCROSS_BUILD_STAGE:STRING=CROSS -Dcross_target:STRING=xk7_gnu \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Release \
  -DBUILD_TESTING:BOOL=TRUE \
  -DParaView_FROM_GIT:BOOL=OFF \
  -DENABLE_paraview:BOOL=TRUE \

then make again

Probably easiest to set them in
CMake/cross_compile/bgp_xlc/ParaViewDefaults.cmake.

That is what defined the initial CMakeCache for ParaView itself (as opposed
to the CMakeCache of the outer super build project).

Thank you Mark.  I checked and the stack size limit was already pretty high, but I set it to unlimited anyway.  Unfortunately I'm still getting the same crashing behavior.  I also just installed Paraview on a windows computer and I have the same problem.  Rendering works very well when I set the VOI up to about half the full volume size.  Any higher than that and Paraview crashes instantly.  The crash details show (not surprisingly) that the fault module is vtkRenderingVolume-pv4.0.dll.  Does anyone have any other ideas?

Thanks,
Cody

Hi Cody,

I've had a similar experience and it was because I had a limited stack size in the shell I was launching paraview from. Try checking ulimit -a

Hope that helps,
Mark

Subject: [Paraview] Volume Rendering Crash

Dear Paraview Community,

I am volume rendering a 2560 x 2160 x 200 image stack that totals 2 GB in size.  The stack loads fine, Paraview consistently crashes when I try to render the whole volume.  The data is represented as a uniform grid.  I don't think this is a memory issue.  I have monitored memory usage during crashes and the system always has at least 29 GB of free memory when it crashes.  The behavior is the same regardless of which rendering algorithm I choose (smart, ray cast, texture mapping, GPU).  I have tried loading the data in both RAW format and NRRD format with no luck.  I am using the Linux 64 bit binary installation from the Paraview website.  My desktop is running CentOS.

I'd appreciate any advice you might have for me.

Thanks,
Cody

Yes. Just use  "Save Data". Note only polydata can be exported as STL.
So you may have to apply "Extract Surface" filter (and possibly
"Triangulate" filter too) before saving a STL.

I can certainly reproduce the issue with your dataset. We'll track it down.

Many thanks, David. I am able to modify ParaViewDefaults.cmake to add options to build my new plugin and PhastaAdaptor with superbuild on Titan. I now have linking errors when linking Catalyst in ParaView version 4.0.1 with our simulation code. Will start a new thread on the problem.

Thanks again for all the useful information!

Best regards,

Probably easiest to set them in CMake/cross_compile/bgp_xlc/ParaViewDefaults.cmake.

That is what defined the initial CMakeCache for ParaView itself (as opposed to the CMakeCache of the outer super build project).

Thanks very much for the info, David. Turning off MPI4PY for version 3.98 as you suggested works for me to build version 3.98 on Titan also with SuperBuild.

I do want to stick with 4.0, but built 3.98 also just in case since my new plugin works well on version 3.98. After some further examination, it looks like my plugin should work on version 4.0 also. Have put my plugin code into 4.0 source directory under both tools and cross subdirectories and hope it can be built and work for version 4.0 also.

Have spent this morning trying to figure out how to turn on some additional flags in superbuild such as my new filter plugin, Fortran coprocessing adaptor, and Phasta adaptor, but cannot succeed. Hope to get some hint on how to do so. Apparently, passing those flags in by adding corresponding ?D to configuretools only resulted in CMake warning indicating those manually-specified variables were not used. Have tried to change some cmake files in superbuild, but does not seem to have any effect. Really appreciate any suggestions you can offer here to turn on those additional flags which are important for our coprocessing purposes.

Thanks,

Hong

Between 3.98 and 4.0 the syntax of the option to turn off MPI4PY changes like so:
I recommend staying with 4.0, but try reverting this change if you need 3.98 for some reason.

Just a quick update. Like Mark, I can build ParaView 4.0.1 with Superbuild successfully without issues using CMake 2.8.11.2 on Titan. However, I cannot build Paraview 3.98.1 with Superbuild using the same CMake version. I still got the same linking error from mpi4py.MPI.c in the final stage of linking after 100% built for the cross stage (see below for details) if I built version 3.98.1 using superbuild. Perhaps the latest version of Superbuild has some sort of incompatibility with the older version of ParaView for xk7_gnu target? Anyway, looks like we have to go with the latest ParaView version for in-situ visualization on Titan since superbuild does not work with older 3.98.1 version for us, which may very well prove a good thing for us in the long run due to a lot of improvement made on Catalyst in the latest ParaView version.

Thanks for the info, Mark. Looks like it is sensible for me to try newer version of CMake 2.8.11.2 and see how it goes.

On a somewhat related question: I am trying to pass in some CMake flags to make it build my new filter plugin as well as FortranAdaptor for coprocessing (yes, I discovered also that coprocessing/catalyst is built by default by superbuild, but FortranAdaptor is turned off by default). I tried to pass it in by adding corresponding ?D to configuretools, but got CMake warning as well indicating those manually-specified variables were not used. I am wondering whether I can do it by directly changing CMakeCache.txt under paraview/src/paraview-build to force the corresponding flags to be on?

I tried to follow the instructions and the configuration scripts to build ParaView for compute nodes on Titan. It built successfully without issues for the TOOLS stage, but when doing final linking for paraview in the CROSS stage, I got numerous similar linking error from different lines such as the following:

----------------
/....../ParaView/ParaViewSuperbuild/cross/paraview/src/paraview/Utilities/mpi4py/src/mpi4py.MPI.c: In function '__pyx_pf_6mpi4py_3MPI_4File_54Sync':

----------------

The same error message were raised from the same file mpi4py.MPI.c from different lines.

I am using CMake version 2.8.10.2 which is provided by Titan, and using the ParaView source tree version 3.98 with one additional filter I have developed.

Any idea on what could cause the linking error?

So coprocessing will not be built using the below instructions? I would have mentioned that, but coprocessing appears to
still be part of a regular, non-cross-compile build, so I figured it was part of ENABLE_paraview

The coprocessing plugin, which adds things to the GUI to make it easy to record coprocessing pipeline setups doesn't need to be turned on since that lives in the client only. (It is like python trace or state recording, but tailored to recording in-situ setups).

Catalyst (the stripped down version of ParaView server that a simulation code can link to and use to run those recorded pipelines quickly) is not yet an option in ParaViewSuperbuild. To cross compile Catalyst a bit more work will be required. It will follow the same plan as how the ParaView server is compiled, but I just haven't tried it. When I did cross compile Catalyst last year at this time I did the same steps that ParaViewSuperbuild's TOOLS and CROSS build passes did, just by hand.
Also, for the below configcross.sh, do we need to pass in a CMake variable telling it where the tools build dir is located?

That should be an option that you can easily set, but it isn't sorry.

 CMake/CrossCompilationMacros.cmake assumes it can find it one directory up and over like so:
macro(find_hosttools)
  set(PARAVIEW_HOSTTOOLS_DIR ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/../tools/paraview/src/paraview-build/ CACHE PATH
    "Location of host built paraview compile tools directory")
  set(PYTHON_HOST_EXE ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/../tools/install/bin/python CACHE PATH
    "Location of host built python executable")
  set(PYTHON_HOST_LIBDIR ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/../tools/install/lib CACHE PATH
    "Location of host built python libraries")
  set(BOOST_HOST_INCLUDEDIR ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/../tools/install/include CACHE PATH
    "Location of host built boost headers")
endmacro()

You could predefine all four of those if you like.

Hi David,

I just started to try superbuild on Titan also. I don't see you set ENABLE_MPI to be true in your configure script. Could you confirm whether ENABLE_MPI needs to be set to TRUE in order for ParaView to run on Titan in parallel? Since my purpose is to link our

The ENABLE_MPI flag at the Superbuild level is unrelated. It has a purpose only when CROSS_BUILD_STAGE=HOST, that is when making ParaView binary installers for desktops from Superbuild.

You shouldn't turn it on in the TOOLS or CROSS stages. Instead let the CROSS stage use the system installed MPI. It does that by turning PARAVIEW_USE_MPI=ON when it configures the ParaView sub-build. See CMake/crosscompile/xk7_gnu to see where it does that, and to see the other flags it uses.

simulation code (already built statically with CMake on Titan) to ParaView CoProcessing libraries (I am using version 3.98.1) for in-situ visualization on Titan, so in this case, do I have to set ENABLE_paraview to true and do I need to enable OSMesa for ParaView to resort to off-screen rendering for in-situ visualization?

The CROSS stage turns on Python, Mesa and ParaView. Titan's accelerators don't really run X11, so Mesa is the only option for rendering there.

Although I can build ParaView from source on Titan login nodes, I am not able to run it on compute nodes, so I am starting to try superbuild hoping to be able to cross build ParaView libraries to run in-situ visualization on Titan.

I've cross compiled Catalyst itself before on a bluegene. I did it manually before SuperBuild existed. I will see if I can dig up my config scripts. Cross compiling Catalyst should be more or less that same thing as cross compiling ParaView, but a bit faster and easier because their is less code involved.

Thanks,
Hong

Your tools build is pointing to the compiler wrapper that you normally would use to make code for the back end.
The tools build should just use plain old local gcc since we only build things at that point that run on the login node.

Try these setup scripts:
I source configtools.sh to set up my environment before I build the compile tools, and configcross.sh before before I cross compile ParaView.

configtools.sh
#use my own cmake, system one is too old
setenv PATH /autofs/na4_proj/csc035/demarle/pvdev/titan/cmake-build/bin:${PATH}
#switch compiler to compile code for front end
module unload PrgEnv-pgi
module load gcc
#configure settings for to build compile tools only
cmake \
  -DCROSS_BUILD_STAGE:STRING=TOOLS -Dcross_target:STRING=xk7_gnu \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Release \
  -DBUILD_TESTING:BOOL=FALSE \
  -DParaView_FROM_GIT:BOOL=OFF \
  -DENABLE_paraview:BOOL=TRUE \
  -DENABLE_boost:BOOL=TRUE \
  -DENABLE_python:BOOL=TRUE \
  -DENABLE_portfwd:BOOL=FALSE \
  ../../ParaViewSuperbuild


then make

configcross.sh
#use my own cmake, system one is too old
setenv PATH /autofs/na4_proj/csc035/demarle/pvdev/titan/cmake-build/bin:${PATH}
#switch compiler to compile code for back end

#not sure why module load wasn't sufficient, but ended up needing to force
#cmake to choose the right compiler
setenv CC /opt/cray/xt-asyncpe/5.17/bin/cc
setenv CXX /opt/cray/xt-asyncpe/5.17/bin/CC
#configure settings to cross compile python, (mesa - implied), and paraview

Subject: [Paraview] Errors when linking catalyst in ParaView version 4.0.1
 to simulation code on Titan
Message-ID: <65F8B323A072504ABFC5D3D8751910514FEB3B22@MAIL-MBX2.ad.renci.org>

When linking our simulation code (a variant of phasta) to Catalyst in ParaView version 4.0.1 built on Titan with superbuild, I got the following linking errors:

-----------------
../../lib/libincompressible.a(itrdrv.f.o): In function `itrdrv_':

phastaadaptor.f:(.text+0xba): undefined reference to `coprocess_'
/usr/bin/ld: link errors found, deleting executable `../../bin/phastaIC.exe'
-----------------

I use CMake to link Catalyst to our simulation code. I was able to resolve those linking errors when linking to ParaView version 3.98.1 by adding "find_package(ParaView 3.98 REQUIRED COMPONENTS FortranAdaptor)" in addition to find_package for vtkCoProcessorImplementation and then link both to the final executable. However, for ParaView version 4.0.1, it seems FortranAdaptor does not exist any more which defines those functions such as coprocessorinitialize, etc. Here is the corresponding excerpt in my CMakeLists.txt related to linking Catalyst in ParaView version 4.0.1:
-------------------
if(USE_CATALYST)
       find_package(ParaView 3.98 REQUIRED COMPONENTS vtkPVPythonCatalyst)
        find_library(PHASTA_ADAPTOR_LIB PhastaAdaptorLib)
        include("${PARAVIEW_USE_FILE}")
        set(Adaptor_SRCS phastaadaptor.f)
        add_library(Adaptor ${Adaptor_SRCS})
        target_link_libraries(Adaptor ${PHASTA_ADAPTOR_LIB} vtkPVPythonCatalyst)
        add_definitions("-DUSE_CATALYST")
endif()
-------------------

Adaptor is then linked to the final executable.

Please let me know if you have ideas on what I should do to resolve those linking errors.

Many thanks,

Hong

Compile ParaView debug, and try it in a debugger?  Otherwise, get a copy of your dataset to Kitware, and have them do the same?  That's about the only thing I can think of.

Thank you Mark.  I checked and the stack size limit was already pretty high, but I set it to unlimited anyway.  Unfortunately I'm still getting the same crashing behavior.  I also just installed Paraview on a windows computer and I have the same problem.  Rendering works very well when I set the VOI up to about half the full volume size.  Any higher than that and Paraview crashes instantly.  The crash details show (not surprisingly) that the fault module is vtkRenderingVolume-pv4.0.dll.  Does anyone have any other ideas?

Dear Paraview Community,

I am volume rendering a 2560 x 2160 x 200 image stack that totals 2 GB in size.  The stack loads fine, Paraview consistently crashes when I try to render the whole volume.  The data is represented as a uniform grid.  I don't think this is a memory issue.  I have monitored memory usage during crashes and the system always has at least 29 GB of free memory when it crashes.  The behavior is the same regardless of which rendering algorithm I choose (smart, ray cast, texture mapping, GPU).  I have tried loading the data in both RAW format and NRRD format with no luck.  I am using the Linux 64 bit binary installation from the Paraview website.  My desktop is running CentOS.

I'd appreciate any advice you might have for me.

Thanks,

Subject: [Xdmf] Seeking help with display hdf5 file in paraview using xdmf

Hi All!

I have a technique issue with displaying hdf5 file in paraview.
I have to store a surface into hdf5 file and to display it in paraview.
The surface is made up by base grid triangles and planer graphs on each basegrid triangle.  The planar graphs in base grid triangle includes points and edges.
I store the coordinate of the vertex of base grid triangles in surface.h5:/xbasetrianglecoords
surface.h5:/ybasetrianglecoords
surface.h5:/zbasetrianglecoords
and the coordinate of nodes on planer graphs in
surface.h5:/xnodescoords
surface.h5:/ynodescoords
surface.h5:/znodescoords
If I only need to display the base triangle coords, I would write the xdmf as
<Geometry GeometryType="X_Y_Z">
<DataItem Dimensions="318" NumberType="Float" Format="HDF">
surface.h5:/xbasetrianglecoords
</DataItem>
<DataItem Dimensions="318" NumberType="Float" Format="HDF">
surface.h5:/ybasetrianglecoords
</DataItem>
<DataItem Dimensions="318" NumberType="Float" Format="HDF">
surface.h5:/zbasetrianglecoords
</DataItem>
</Geometry>
What if I want to display both of them?
I tried to do this:
<Geometry GeometryType="X_Y_Z">
<DataItem Dimensions="1212" NumberType="Float" Format="HDF">
surface.h5:/xbasetrianglecoords
surface.h5:/xnodescoords
</DataItem>
<DataItem Dimensions="1212" NumberType="Float" Format="HDF">
surface.h5:/ybasetrianglecoords
surface.h5:/ynodescoords
</DataItem>
<DataItem Dimensions="1212" NumberType="Float" Format="HDF">
surface.h5:/zbasetrianglecoords
surface.h5:/znodescoords
</DataItem>
</Geometry>
But it does no work. I am wondering if anyone on this list have any experience with this problem(put 2 hdf5 files in one entry)?
Best,
Xiaoxue

Message-ID: <DE77D91099A46441AEAFCCB3D6878BCB2E8D96EE@EP1EXMB005.corp.halliburton.com>



Hi all,

Does anyone know if you can change the position of the title on the scale bar. When the interpret values as caterogies option is ticked, then the title position can be adjusted, but when Intervals or ratios is selected the title cannot be centered.

Also, is there any way of changing the positions of the top and bottom number on the scale. In 3.98 and earlier, they were located above and below but in 4.0 they are placed on the opposite side to the other numbers which makes the scale bar very wide on the page.

Would appreciate if anyone knows how to work around these defaults.

Thanks,

Raquel

UNRESTRICTED | ILLIMIT?

 

Hi All,

 

This is a simple question but I can't seem to quite figure it out.  I just want to plot a variable in the view window and have the maximum and minimum values to not be rounded.  In other cases I would like to not have the maximum and minimum values indicated in the legend.  If I go into the color scale editor it shows the maximum and minimum to be 1897.4 and 605.195 respectively but the scale shown on the figure is rounded to 1.9e+03 and 605.  I would like those to show the values provided in the color scale editor.  Going to the colour legend tab allows me to change the title.  I see the tick format box but do not quite understand what to put in there to obtain what I want.

 

Thank you,

 

Kyle

Hi Kyle,

In ParaView 4.0.1, in the Color Scale Editor's Color Legend tab, if you uncheck Automatic Tick Mark Format, then you can edit the Tick Format field. I believe it's basically printf format style strings.

Hi Hong,


I think it's the Fortran mangling of the names. Try taking out the
underscore on the Fortran subroutine calls. Let me know if that doesn't
help. Otherwise it may be an issue with how C/Fortran mangles things. The
GCC behavior should be the following:
Fortran -> call xyz()
C -> void xyz_() {...}.

All of these methods should be available in the vtkPVCatalyst module. If
you can't get it to work, try to see what you can do with the Fortran
example in the github repo.

Regards,
And

Hi Andy,

Thanks for the useful info. You are exactly right - the problem is caused by C/Fortran mangling of the names. In the Fortran code, underbar trailing is not there for all catalyst-related function calls, those underbar trailing to the function names as shown in the linking errors are automatically added by C/Fortran mangling in the final linking stage. I also pulled in the Fortran example in the github repo, and got the similar undefined reference errors in the final linking stage when linking to the ParaView 4.0 built with superbuild. So the linking problem seems to be generic to Fortran code linking to Catalyst.

I checked the Catalyst static lib built with superbuild and found the lib only includes function symbols without the trailing underbar such as coprocessorinitialize, which explains why those undefined reference errors result. I also tried to build ParaView 3.98 with superbuild which included FortranAdaptor lib, and found the FortranAdatpor lib built with superbuild does not include the trailing underbar for coprocessor-related functions, while the FortranAdaptor lib built from source does include the trailing underbar, which explains why I can link our simulation code to Catalyst 3.98 built from source, but cannot successfully link to Catalyst 3.98 built with superbuild. So here is my question:

Should Catalyst libs built with superbuild contain those coprocessing function symbols with trailing underbar in addition to those corresponding function symbols without trailing underbar? Specifically, for example, I am wondering whether both coprocessorinitialize and coprocessorinitialize_ need to present so these coprocessing functions can be called from different languages including Fortran? Could you confirm whether this is the case? If so, I need to check my superbuild to see why those trailing underbar functions are not created in the Catalyst libs. Let me know if you, David, or anybody else can confirm whether this is the case, or offer any ideas/suggestions.

Thanks,

Hong

I use CMake to link Catalyst to our simulation code. I was able to resolve those linking errors when linking to ParaView version 3.98.1 by adding "find_package(ParaView 3.98 REQUIRED COMPONENTS FortranAdaptor)" in addition to find_package for vtkCoProcessorImplementation and then link both to the final executable. However, for ParaView version 4.0.1, it seems FortranAdaptor does not exist any more which defines those functions such as coprocessorinitialize, etc. Here is the corresponding excerpt in my CMakeLists.txt related to linking Catalyst in ParaView version 4.0.1:
-------------------
if(USE_CATALYST)
       find_package(ParaView 3.98 REQUIRED COMPONENTS vtkPVPythonCatalyst)
        find_library(PHASTA_ADAPTOR_LIB PhastaAdaptorLib)

        set(Adaptor_SRCS phastaadaptor.f)
        add_library(Adaptor ${Adaptor_SRCS})
        target_link_libraries(Adaptor ${PHASTA_ADAPTOR_LIB} vtkPVPythonCatalyst)
        add_definitions("-DUSE_CATALYST")
endif()
-------------------

Adaptor is then linked to the final executable.

Please let me know if you have ideas on what I should do to resolve those linking errors.

Many thanks,

Hong

Hi Hong,

This Fortran/C mangling issue is a bit tricky. It has to be done during the
configuration process because the C and Fortran compilers won't necessarily
know how to properly mangle the function names. The thing is that it the
configuration process depends on using the same compilers as any other code
that links to the generated libraries. You can check out Bill Hoffman's
blog at http://www.kitware.com/blog/home/post/231 which explains this issue
and how CMake handles it. Now if ParaView Catalyst was built with GCC and
you built your simulation code with PGI, for example, then it wouldn't
surprise me that this issue crops up. What compilers did you use for your
ParaView build and your simulation code build? If they are consistent then
it is a problem with CMake or ParaView's superbuild.

The Superbuild on cray uses the backend flavor of the GCC compiler (xk7_gcc
target). I haven't made an xk7_pgi target yet.

Hi Andy, David,

I used GCC to build both ParaView and simulation code. The problem is with ParaView's superbuild not being able to find MPI_Fortran on Titan. I got the following messages during superbuild:

--------------
Could NOT find MPI_Fortran (missing:  MPI_Fortran_LIBRARIES MPI_Fortran_INCLUDE_PATH)

No FortranCInterface mangling known for coprocessorinitialize

...

--------------

I then tried to add "ftn" into FindMPI.cmake, but got the message "Unable to determine MPI from MPI driver /opt/cray/xt-asyncpe/5.17/bin/ftn" prior to those MPI_Fortran errors. I looked at ftn wrapper but could not determine the mpi Fortran executable, either. Let me know if you have ideas on how to make superbuild to find MPI_Fortran.

Many thanks,

Hong

Hi Andy,

Thanks for the useful info. You are exactly right ? the problem is caused by C/Fortran mangling of the names. In the Fortran code, underbar trailing is not there for all catalyst-related function calls, those underbar trailing to the function names as shown in the linking errors are automatically added by C/Fortran mangling in the final linking stage. I also pulled in the Fortran example in the github repo, and got the similar undefined reference errors in the final linking stage when linking to the ParaView 4.0 built with superbuild. So the linking problem seems to be generic to Fortran code linking to Catalyst.

I checked the Catalyst static lib built with superbuild and found the lib only includes function symbols without the trailing underbar such as coprocessorinitialize, which explains why those undefined reference errors result. I also tried to build ParaView 3.98 with superbuild which included FortranAdaptor lib, and found the FortranAdatpor lib built with superbuild does not include the trailing underbar for coprocessor-related functions, while the FortranAdaptor lib built from source does include the trailing underbar, which explains why I can link our simulation code to Catalyst 3.98 built from source, but cannot successfully link to Catalyst 3.98 built with superbuild. So here is my question:

Should Catalyst libs built with superbuild contain those coprocessing function symbols with trailing underbar in addition to those corresponding function symbols without trailing underbar? Specifically, for example, I am wondering whether both coprocessorinitialize and coprocessorinitialize_ need to present so these coprocessing functions can be called from different languages including Fortran? Could you confirm whether this is the case? If so, I need to check my superbuild to see why those trailing underbar functions are not created in the Catalyst libs. Let me know if you, David, or anybody else can confirm whether this is the case, or offer any ideas/suggestions.

Thanks,

Hong

Hi Hong,

I think it's the Fortran mangling of the names. Try taking out the underscore on the Fortran subroutine calls. Let me know if that doesn't help. Otherwise it may be an issue with how C/Fortran mangles things. The GCC behavior should be the following:
Fortran -> call xyz()
C -> void xyz_() {...}.
All of these methods should be available in the vtkPVCatalyst module. If you can't get it to work, try to see what you can do with the Fortran example in the github repo.

And

However, for ParaView version 4.0.1, it seems FortranAdaptor does not exist any more which defines those functions such as coprocessorinitialize, etc. Here is the corresponding excerpt in my CMakeLists.txt related to linking Catalyst in ParaView version 4.0.1:

Adaptor is then linked to the final executable.

Please let me know if you have ideas on what I should do to resolve those linking errors.

Hi, George.

I was able to track down the issue. In 
ParticleDistribute::readFromBlockFile, there is a filter to determine 
the 'active' particles (near line 1300). It requires that the components 
of the positions of each particle lie within the components of the 
minAlive/maxAlive values (currently set to 0 and rL, respectively). 
However, the Gadget2 coordinate system uses an origin that lies between 
the two galaxies I was simulating. Hence, many of the coordinates lied 
well outside of the [0,rL] boundary (almost all were negative). Removing 
the bounding box filter, I get the expected (and correct!) results 
(attached; colored by particle type (tag) - pink is disk, white/blue are 
dark matter halo).

My interpretation of this behaviour is that, in general, the bounding 
box filter is necessary to ensure only those particles which the user 
cares about are rendered. Is this true? If so, the enforcement of a 
physical box with **only** positive coordinate values seems 
unnecessarily constrained. For tree codes such as Gadget2, this is 
especially true since there is no box at all.

I think the easiest fix is to tweak the interface to allow the user to 
specify the bounds of the simulation box rather than relying on the 
implicit use of [0,rL].

Thoughts?

Many thanks.

P.S. The resulting movie looks great! I really want to use ParaView for 
all my simulation visualizations because of the ease and quality of the 
movies it makes. I am hopeful we can get Gadget2 to work with the 
current importer without too much trouble.

Subject: [Paraview] Errors when linking catalyst in ParaView version
 4.0.1 to, simulation code on Titan (Hong Yi)

Hi Hong Yi,

I got a similar error. One way to is to find the paths for the mpi
libraries on titan directly - do module show cray_mpich for the mpich
version in your gcc environment. When you run ccmake, toggle to the
advanced configuration and enter the paths directly. You will need to
manually add all the statically linked libraries. To put in more than
one library on the same line, you will need to separate the paths by
semicolons.

Regards,
Benson

It has to be done during the configuration process because the C and Fortran compilers won't necessarily know how to properly mangle the function names. The thing is that it the configuration process depends on using the same compilers as any other code that links to the generated libraries. You can check out Bill Hoffman's blog at http://www.kitware.com/blog/home/post/231 which explains this issue and how CMake handles it. Now if ParaView Catalyst was built with GCC and you built your simulation code with PGI, for example, then it wouldn't surprise me that this issue crops up. What compilers did you use for your ParaView build and your simulation code build? If they are consistent then it is a problem with CMake or ParaView's superbuild.

In the Fortran code, underbar trailing is not there for all catalyst-related function calls, those underbar trailing to the function names as shown in the linking errors are automatically added by C/Fortran mangling in the final linking stage. I also pulled in the Fortran example in the github repo, and got the similar undefined reference errors in the final linking stage when linking to the ParaView 4.0 built with superbuild. So the linking problem seems to be generic to Fortran code linking to Catalyst.

I also tried to build ParaView 3.98 with superbuild which included FortranAdaptor lib, and found the FortranAdatpor lib built with superbuild does not include the trailing underbar for coprocessor-related functions, while the FortranAdaptor lib built from source does include the trailing underbar, which explains why I can link our simulation code to Catalyst 3.98 built from source, but cannot successfully link to Catalyst 3.98 built with superbuild. So here is my question:
>
> Should Catalyst libs built with superbuild contain those coprocessing function symbols with trailing underbar in addition to those corresponding function symbols without trailing underbar? Specifically, for example, I am wondering whether both coprocessorinitialize and coprocessorinitialize_ need to present so these coprocessing functions can be called from different languages including Fortran? Could you confirm whether this is the case? If so, I need to check my superbuild to see why those trailing underbar functions are not created in the Catalyst libs. Let me know if you, David, or anybody else can confirm whether this is the case, or offer any ideas/suggestions.

I was able to resolve those linking errors when linking to ParaView version 3.98.1 by adding "find_package(ParaView 3.98 REQUIRED COMPONENTS FortranAdaptor)" in addition to find_package for vtkCoProcessorImplementation and then link both to the final executable. However, for ParaView version 4.0.1, it seems FortranAdaptor does not exist any more which defines those functions such as coprocessorinitialize, etc. Here is the corresponding excerpt in my CMakeLists.txt related to linking Catalyst in ParaView version 4.0.1:

Hi Tim,

I think you're correct. Indeed, there is such a filter in the code. In the
context that this code is being used, the domain is indeed defined in [0,
rL]. Your suggestion seems reasonable, but it may be a little more
involved, because, that's how the code knows to produce ghost regions
across periodic boundaries and we will need to make sure that [0,rL] is not
being assumed anywhere else in the code.

I'll take a look at that.

Cheers,
George

Is there a way to find the path of the a running python script?
I'm trying to get it from __file__ or sys.argv[0].
But both of them give errors.
When I tried __file__, it says __file__ is not defined.
When i tried?sys.argv[0], it says 'module' object has no attribute 'argv'.

Dear Users,

I am new using the paraview software. I am trying to generate from a list of data in the x,y,z,scalar format a contour plot. Attached you will find and example of the data I am working with. As you see this is just a 2d plot which I need to generate. I wasn't able to find a solution. Would you mind to help me please? Or is it not possible?

I hope you will have an answer for me.

All the best,

Eduardo

Eduardo,

After loading your cvs file, run in through the Table To Points filter. Then use the Delaunay 2D filter to create cells connecting the points. From there you can run the Contour filter.

BTW, if you data happens to be a regular grid, you can run the Table To Structured Grid filter instead of Table To Points and Delaunay, but the example data you posted is not completely regular.

Ken,

Thank you for your answer. I did that, but the problem is that the scalar values are not shown in my paraview version. Does it have a bug? I have the 3.12.0-rc2 64bits.......I got only a contour plot of one color (white), if I change the display options to scalar or cellnormals nothing interesting happens. I am only able to change the color of those contours, but the values are not shown at all in a color scale. Should I do something different?

All the best,

Eduardo

That is a pretty old version of ParaView. It's also not a real release (RC stands for release candidate) so there might be bugs. Before I sent out my original email I tried it out on your data with ParaView 4.0.1 and had no problems. Any chance you can update your version of ParaView?

Thanks for the useful info, Benson. I did what you suggested and now superbuild can find MPI_FORTRAN. However, FortranCInterface_GLOBAL_FOUND variable is zero, so I still got the warning "No FortranCInterface mangling known for coprocessorinitialize" during the build. Did you get that error also? I have not found where FortranCInterface_GLOBAL_FOUND variable is set in CMake yet, so have no exact clue on why this variable is zero (i.e., why FortranCInterface_GLOBAL is not found). Have to dig in deeper to see what else I need to set for superbuild to find FortranCInterface, but let me know if you or anybody else in the list have some suggestions on what to look for to resolve this issue.

Thanks and regards,

Hong

Hi Hong Yi,

I got a similar error. One way to is to find the paths for the mpi
libraries on titan directly - do module show cray_mpich for the mpich
version in your gcc environment. When you run ccmake, toggle to the
advanced configuration and enter the paths directly. You will need to
manually add all the statically linked libraries. To put in more than
one library on the same line, you will need to separate the paths by
semicolons.

Regards,
Benson

It has to be done during the configuration process because the C and Fortran compilers won't necessarily know how to properly mangle the function names. The thing is that it the configuration process depends on using the same compilers as any other code that links to the generated libraries. You can check out Bill Hoffman's blog at http://www.kitware.com/blog/home/post/231 which explains this issue and how CMake handles it. Now if ParaView Catalyst was built with GCC and you built your simulation code with PGI, for example, then it wouldn't surprise me that this issue crops up. What compilers did you use for your ParaView build and your simulation code build? If they are consistent then it is a problem with CMake or ParaView's superbuild.

In the Fortran code, underbar trailing is not there for all catalyst-related function calls, those underbar trailing to the function names as shown in the linking errors are automatically added by C/Fortran mangling in the final linking stage. I also pulled in the Fortran example in the github repo, and got the similar undefined reference errors in the final linking stage when linking to the ParaView 4.0 built with superbuild. So the linking problem seems to be generic to Fortran code linking to Catalyst.

I also tried to build ParaView 3.98 with superbuild which included FortranAdaptor lib, and found the FortranAdatpor lib built with superbuild does not include the trailing underbar for coprocessor-related functions, while the FortranAdaptor lib built from source does include the trailing underbar, which explains why I can link our simulation code to Catalyst 3.98 built from source, but cannot successfully link to Catalyst 3.98 built with superbuild. So here is my question:
>
> Should Catalyst libs built with superbuild contain those coprocessing function symbols with trailing underbar in addition to those corresponding function symbols without trailing underbar? Specifically, for example, I am wondering whether both coprocessorinitialize and coprocessorinitialize_ need to present so these coprocessing functions can be called from different languages including Fortran? Could you confirm whether this is the case? If so, I need to check my superbuild to see why those trailing underbar functions are not created in the Catalyst libs. Let me know if you, David, or anybody else can confirm whether this is the case, or offer any ideas/suggestions.

I was able to resolve those linking errors when linking to ParaView version 3.98.1 by adding "find_package(ParaView 3.98 REQUIRED COMPONENTS FortranAdaptor)" in addition to find_package for vtkCoProcessorImplementation and then link both to the final executable. However, for ParaView version 4.0.1, it seems FortranAdaptor does not exist any more which defines those functions such as coprocessorinitialize, etc. Here is the corresponding excerpt in my CMakeLists.txt related to linking Catalyst in ParaView version 4.0.1:

Thank you for your reply.
I tried methods that webpage mentioned.
Unfortunately, both __file__ and sys.argv[0] didn't work in the paraview python environment.

Subject: [Paraview] Announcing ParaView Catalyst webinar
Message-ID: <CAMaOp+HB3PPZzq=F9=niqu5eF9F7BRWYzQXXWcUEo4dqHPNKoA@mail.gmail.com>

Good afternoon all,

We?d like to announce an upcoming webinar, ParaView Catalyst: Leverage *in
situ* Analysis with VTK and ParaView. The free webinar will be on September
26 from 2:00-3:00 EDT (and it will be recorded and posted to the website if
you can't join us live).

Hosted by Kitware, this free, one hour webinar will introduce ParaView
Catalyst, a flexible in situ library that leverages VTK and ParaView. The
webinar will highlight the benefits of ParaView Catalyst and how to
leverage them for your own simulations. Free registration (space is
limited!) is available through
GoToWebinar<https://www3.gotomeeting.com/register/704531486>
.

If there is a webinar topic that you?d like to recommend we cover, please
email Kitware at kitware.com.

Thanks!

Hey Ken,

It worker perfectly...you were right I just neede to update my paraview. I am looking at my data right now....it is pretty awesome.

Eduardo,





That is a pretty old version of ParaView. It's also not a real release (RC stands for release candidate) so there might be bugs. Before I sent out my original email I tried it out on your data with ParaView 4.0.1 and had no problems. Any chance you can
 update your version of ParaView?

Ken,



Thank you for your answer. I did that, but the problem is that the scalar values are not shown in my paraview version. Does it have a bug? I have the 3.12.0-rc2 64bits.......I got only a contour plot of one color (white), if I change the display options to
 scalar or cellnormals nothing interesting happens. I am only able to change the color of those contours, but the values are not shown at all in a color scale. Should I do something different?



All the best,



Eduardo

Eduardo,





After loading your cvs file, run in through the Table To Points filter. Then use the Delaunay 2D filter to create cells connecting the points. From there you can run the Contour filter.



BTW, if you data happens to be a regular grid, you can run the Table To Structured Grid filter instead of Table To Points and Delaunay, but the example data you posted is not completely regular.

Dear Users,



I am new using the paraview software. I am trying to generate from a list of data in the x,y,z,scalar format a contour plot. Attached you will find and example of the data I am working with. As you see this is just a 2d plot which I need to generate. I wasn't
 able to find a solution. Would you mind to help me please? Or is it not possible?



I hope you will have an answer for me.



All the best,

Hi Hong,

Can you share all of the CMake variables regarding Fortran and Phasta Coprocessing you might have hand set during the superbuild process? I'm trying to compare to a successful non-superbuild Fortran copro install on my workstation.

Thanks,
Mark

Hi Mark,

I just added the following:

------------------
list(APPEND PARAVIEW_OPTIONS "-DMPI_Fortran_COMPILER:FILEPATH=/opt/cray/xt-asyncpe/5.17/bin/ftn")
list(APPEND PARAVIEW_OPTIONS "-DMPI_Fortran_INCLUDE_PATH:FILEPATH=/opt/cray/mpt/5.6.3/gni/mpich2-gnu/47/include")
list(APPEND PARAVIEW_OPTIONS "-DMPI_Fortran_LIBRARIES:FILEPATH=/opt/cray/mpt/5.6.3/gni/mpich2-gnu/47/lib/libfmpich.a;/opt/cray/mpt/5.6.3/gni/mpich2-gnu/47/lib/libmpichf90.a")
------------------

While looking into the CMakeError.log, I found there are a few related undefined reference errors during the final linking stages when linking FortranCInterface, hence FortranCInterface got dropped in both tools and cross stages. I am trying to play with some options and rebuilt everything. 

By the way, have you been able to successfully superbuild paraview with FortranCInterface/FortranCMangling built also successfully on Titan? If so, could you share what additional options you have added into ParaViewDefaults.cmake to have them build successfully?

Thanks,
Hong

Hi David,

I found FortranCInterface was not built even in the first TOOLS pass. Here are the errors I am getting from CMakeError.log:

-----------------
/opt/gcc/4.7.2/bin/gfortran      CMakeFiles/FortranCInterface.dir/main.F.o CMakeFiles/FortranCInterface.dir/call_sub.f.o CMakeFiles/FortranCInterface.dir/call_mod.f90.o  -o FortranCInterface  -L/usr/lib64/gcc/x86_64-suse-linux/4.3  -L/usr/x86_64-suse-linux/lib -rdynamic libsymbols.a libmyfort.a

/opt/gcc/4.7.2/snos/lib/gcc/x86_64-suse-linux/4.7.2/../../../../lib64/libgfortran.so: undefined reference to `__netf2 at GCC_4.3.0'
/opt/gcc/4.7.2/snos/lib/gcc/x86_64-suse-linux/4.7.2/../../../../lib64/libgfortran.so: undefined reference to `__lttf2 at GCC_4.3.0'
/usr/bin/ld: link errors found, deleting executable `FortranCInterface'
-----------------

Could you confirm whether you are getting this error also for your superbuild on Titan? If you are not seeing these errors, could you confirm whether you are using the default gcc version 4.7.2 or some newer version?

Superbuild is able to build other libraries successfully for me on Titan except for this FortranCInterface problems, so I am hoping to confirm with you to see whether this is a specific problem on my part.

Thanks for all your help!

Hong

Your tools build is pointing to the compiler wrapper that you normally would use to make code for the back end.
The tools build should just use plain old local gcc since we only build things at that point that run on the login node.

Try these setup scripts:
I source configtools.sh to set up my environment before I build the compile tools, and configcross.sh before before I cross compile ParaView.

configtools.sh
#use my own cmake, system one is too old
setenv PATH /autofs/na4_proj/csc035/demarle/pvdev/titan/cmake-build/bin:${PATH}
#switch compiler to compile code for front end
module unload PrgEnv-pgi
module load gcc
#configure settings for to build compile tools only
cmake \
  -DCROSS_BUILD_STAGE:STRING=TOOLS -Dcross_target:STRING=xk7_gnu \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Release \
  -DBUILD_TESTING:BOOL=FALSE \

  -DENABLE_paraview:BOOL=TRUE \
  -DENABLE_boost:BOOL=TRUE \
  -DENABLE_python:BOOL=TRUE \
  -DENABLE_portfwd:BOOL=FALSE \
  ../../ParaViewSuperbuild


then make

configcross.sh
#use my own cmake, system one is too old
setenv PATH /autofs/na4_proj/csc035/demarle/pvdev/titan/cmake-build/bin:${PATH}
#switch compiler to compile code for back end
module unload PrgEnv-pgi
module unload gcc
module load PrgEnv-gnu
#not sure why module load wasn't sufficient, but ended up needing to force
#cmake to choose the right compiler
setenv CC /opt/cray/xt-asyncpe/5.17/bin/cc
setenv CXX /opt/cray/xt-asyncpe/5.17/bin/CC
#configure settings to cross compile python, (mesa - implied), and paraview
cmake \

then make again

Any suggestions?

I have the same errors in my CMakeError.log, if I understand what's going on right, those symbols are defined in libgcc_s.so in the same directory, and so that lib isn't being linked?

Thanks, Mark. It is good to know it is not only me having this problem. I found if I remove "-L/usr/lib64/gcc/x86_64-suse-linux/4.3  -L/usr/x86_64-suse-linux/lib" from the build line, I can successfully build FortranCInterface. So the question now becomes how I can remove those two lib paths within CMake so that it can build FortranCInterface and set corresponding flags correctly. Let me know if anybody has some pointers on how to do that within CMake.

Thanks,
Hong

I have the same errors in my CMakeError.log, if I understand what's going on right, those symbols are defined in libgcc_s.so in the same directory, and so that lib isn't being linked?

Hi David,

I found FortranCInterface was not built even in the first TOOLS pass. Here are the errors I am getting from CMakeError.log:

-----------------
/opt/gcc/4.7.2/bin/gfortran      CMakeFiles/FortranCInterface.dir/main.F.o CMakeFiles/FortranCInterface.dir/call_sub.f.o CMakeFiles/FortranCInterface.dir/call_mod.f90.o  -o FortranCInterface  -L/usr/lib64/gcc/x86_64-suse-linux/4.3  -L/usr/x86_64-suse-linux/lib -rdynamic libsymbols.a libmyfort.a

/usr/bin/ld: link errors found, deleting executable `FortranCInterface'
-----------------

Could you confirm whether you are getting this error also for your superbuild on Titan? If you are not seeing these errors, could you confirm whether you are using the default gcc version 4.7.2 or some newer version?

Superbuild is able to build other libraries successfully for me on Titan except for this FortranCInterface problems, so I am hoping to confirm with you to see whether this is a specific problem on my part.

Thanks for all your help!

Your tools build is pointing to the compiler wrapper that you normally would use to make code for the back end.
The tools build should just use plain old local gcc since we only build things at that point that run on the login node.

Try these setup scripts:
I source configtools.sh to set up my environment before I build the compile tools, and configcross.sh before before I cross compile ParaView.

configtools.sh

Message-ID: <011BB2FD7D33AB49936FD297F594AEB8202020B5@SFMB02.exponent.com>

I am using paraview 4.0.1 and found a bug.  I am not sure if this is the best location to report it, but figured I would try it here.  I hope that it can help someone else avoid this problem, and perhaps can get it fixed.

I am running on a Mac OS 10.8.4.  I had an existing pvsm state file.  But, every time I tried to open it, I would get an error about a file not found, and then paraview would crash.  At first I thought that this was a major bug.  I finally figured out that a file path to one of the input files had changed, and that is what was causing the problem.
But, the fact that paraview will crash in that case is still a bug.  If paraview can't find a file in a state file, it should just report the error rather then causing a fatal crash.

Hong, those libs appear to get added by CMAKE_CXX_IMPLICIT_LINK_DIRECTORIES. There's a discussion on the CMake mailing list where someone asks about not linking to the C++ standard library:
http://www.cmake.org/pipermail/cmake/2012-October/052304.html

Where it seems one suggestion is to set this to blank and another is to remove the particular library from the list. I'm not sure where one would put this, though, in the top ParaViewDefaults.cmake? I'll try and report back.

Hi Hong and David,

I was able to get FortranCInterface to build in the tools directory. Even though we were doing module load gcc, CMake was picking up $CC and $CXX as gcc 4.3.4, instead of gcc 4.7.2 like it should have. The fix is to do as in configcross.sh and export CC and CXX,

So my configtools.sh is now

# from David DeMarle
# system CMake is too old
export PATH=/ccs/home/vanmoer/builds/byhand/CMake/2.8.11.2/bin:$PATH
#switch compiler to compile for front end
module unload PrgEnv-pgi
module load gcc
export CC=/opt/gcc/4.7.2/bin/gcc
export CXX=/opt/gcc/4.7.2/bin/g++
#configure settings to build compile tools only

cmake \
-DCROSS_BUILD_STAGE:STRING=TOOLS -Dcross_target:STRING=xk7_gnu \
-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Release \
-DBUILD_TESTING:BOOL=FALSE \
-DParaView_FROM_GIT:BOOL=OFF \
-DENABLE_paraview:BOOL=TRUE \
-DENABLE_boost:BOOL=TRUE \
-DENABLE_python:BOOL=TRUE \
-DENABLE_portfwd:BOOL=FALSE \
../ParaViewSuperbuild

I just started a cross compile based on that and will report back when that finishes.

Hi, I'm trying to follow the advice on building ParaView on Titan using the ParaViewSuperbuild method from an earlier discussion in June.

When I run make in the "TOOLS" directory I get the following error:

I don't see a BUILD_SHARED that I can toggle. All of the CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS* vars are empty, if those are related.

Any suggestions?

Thanks,
Mark

I am getting the following error with a make install.  Anyone have any ideas?

Thanks!

Can you attach/post the state file to reproduce this issue?

Looks like "/projects/viz/paraview/ParaView/4.1.0-alan/Linux-eng-sci-rhel6-x86_64/lib/paraview-4.0/paraview"
couldn't be copied over. Can you check if it exists? Are you doing an
install over an already installed location?

The attached is a simple case that does the job for me.  It tries to open
a vtk file, but that file doesn't exist (I changed the path, on my
machine, but have not even sent it to you).
The specific steps are, I open paraview, select Load State, and select the
attached file.  It then brings up a dialog that says Fix Paths in State
File, and shows LegacyVTKFileReader.  If I click OK, it brings up an
output message with an Error that says Could not Open File (with other
details, but it doesn't stay long) And then it does a hard crash.

Here is the detailed report after the crash:

Hi Alan,

This might be related to the part that we are currently working on with
Dave about the Python build/install rules.
If that's the case this should be fixed by the next gatekeeper review.

But that can only be the case if this is based on a very recent source tree
(a week old at most)

Hi Mark,

Yes, I discovered the same thing yesterday. The reason is that CMake picks up /usr/bin/c++ and /usr/bin/cc automatically which are symlinked to g++-4.3 and gcc-4.3 on Titan. I tried to change CMAKE_C++_COMPILER and CMAKE_C_COMPILER manually through ccmake, however, the changes did not get populated down to subdirectories such as Catalyst sub-directory for some reason. After I manually corrected them over all CMakeCache.txt files down in every subdirectories, FortranCInterface can build successfully. I am currently building cross stage also. Hopefully this is it.

Thanks,
Hong

Hi Hong and David,

I was able to get FortranCInterface to build in the tools directory. Even though we were doing module load gcc, CMake was picking up $CC and $CXX as gcc 4.3.4, instead of gcc 4.7.2 like it should have. The fix is to do as in configcross.sh and export CC and CXX,

So my configtools.sh is now

# from David DeMarle
# system CMake is too old
export PATH=/ccs/home/vanmoer/builds/byhand/CMake/2.8.11.2/bin:$PATH
#switch compiler to compile for front end
module unload PrgEnv-pgi
module load gcc
export CC=/opt/gcc/4.7.2/bin/gcc
export CXX=/opt/gcc/4.7.2/bin/g++
#configure settings to build compile tools only

cmake \
-DCROSS_BUILD_STAGE:STRING=TOOLS -Dcross_target:STRING=xk7_gnu \
-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Release \
-DBUILD_TESTING:BOOL=FALSE \
-DParaView_FROM_GIT:BOOL=OFF \
-DENABLE_paraview:BOOL=TRUE \
-DENABLE_boost:BOOL=TRUE \
-DENABLE_python:BOOL=TRUE \
-DENABLE_portfwd:BOOL=FALSE \
../ParaViewSuperbuild

I just started a cross compile based on that and will report back when that finishes.
Mark

Thanks, Mark. It is good to know it is not only me having this problem. I found if I remove "-L/usr/lib64/gcc/x86_64-suse-linux/4.3  -L/usr/x86_64-suse-linux/lib" from the build line, I can successfully build FortranCInterface. So the question now becomes how I can remove those two lib paths within CMake so that it can build FortranCInterface and set corresponding flags correctly. Let me know if anybody has some pointers on how to do that within CMake.

Thanks,
Hong

I have the same errors in my CMakeError.log, if I understand what's going on right, those symbols are defined in libgcc_s.so in the same directory, and so that lib isn't being linked?

Hi David,

I found FortranCInterface was not built even in the first TOOLS pass. Here are the errors I am getting from CMakeError.log:

-----------------

/usr/bin/ld: link errors found, deleting executable `FortranCInterface'
-----------------

Could you confirm whether you are getting this error also for your superbuild on Titan? If you are not seeing these errors, could you confirm whether you are using the default gcc version 4.7.2 or some newer version?

Superbuild is able to build other libraries successfully for me on Titan except for this FortranCInterface problems, so I am hoping to confirm with you to see whether this is a specific problem on my part.

Thanks for all your help!

Hong

Subject: Re: [Paraview] Building on Titan using ParaViewSuperbuild
Your tools build is pointing to the compiler wrapper that you normally would use to make code for the back end.
The tools build should just use plain old local gcc since we only build things at that point that run on the login node.

Try these setup scripts:
I source configtools.sh to set up my environment before I build the compile tools, and configcross.sh before before I cross compile ParaView.

configtools.sh
#use my own cmake, system one is too old
setenv PATH /autofs/na4_proj/csc035/demarle/pvdev/titan/cmake-build/bin:${PATH}
#switch compiler to compile code for front end
module unload PrgEnv-pgi
module load gcc
#configure settings for to build compile tools only
cmake \
  -DCROSS_BUILD_STAGE:STRING=TOOLS -Dcross_target:STRING=xk7_gnu \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Release \
  -DBUILD_TESTING:BOOL=FALSE \
  -DParaView_FROM_GIT:BOOL=OFF \
  -DENABLE_paraview:BOOL=TRUE \
  -DENABLE_boost:BOOL=TRUE \
  -DENABLE_python:BOOL=TRUE \
  -DENABLE_portfwd:BOOL=FALSE \
  ../../ParaViewSuperbuild


then make

configcross.sh
#use my own cmake, system one is too old
setenv PATH /autofs/na4_proj/csc035/demarle/pvdev/titan/cmake-build/bin:${PATH}
#switch compiler to compile code for back end
module unload PrgEnv-pgi
module unload gcc
module load PrgEnv-gnu
#not sure why module load wasn't sufficient, but ended up needing to force
#cmake to choose the right compiler
setenv CC /opt/cray/xt-asyncpe/5.17/bin/cc
setenv CXX /opt/cray/xt-asyncpe/5.17/bin/CC
#configure settings to cross compile python, (mesa - implied), and paraview
cmake \
  -DCROSS_BUILD_STAGE:STRING=CROSS -Dcross_target:STRING=xk7_gnu \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Release \
  -DBUILD_TESTING:BOOL=TRUE \
  -DParaView_FROM_GIT:BOOL=OFF \
  -DENABLE_paraview:BOOL=TRUE \
  -DENABLE_python:BOOL=TRUE \
  ../../ParaViewSuperbuild

then make again

Hi, I'm trying to follow the advice on building ParaView on Titan using the ParaViewSuperbuild method from an earlier discussion in June.

When I run make in the "TOOLS" directory I get the following error:

I don't see a BUILD_SHARED that I can toggle. All of the CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS* vars are empty, if those are related.

Any suggestions?

Thanks,

Hi,

If I remember correctly, the CFortranInterface utility essentially works in
a separate process space so that it doesn't affect any of the CMake
settings for the current configuration. This may be a better topic for the
CMake list. I'll check with some people today to see about what could be
done with it.

Andy

I am working on a CTH dataset with 1024 spcth files.    I'm able to extract
8 CTH parts using the "CTH Extract Parts" filter and things work reasonably
well.  In client-server mode, I'm able to interact with the data, rotate,
translate, scale, etc without any noticeable performance issues.   By
default, I have distributed rendering enabled and the interactive
performance is good.

However, if I enable opacity on any of those CTH parts that I extract,
interactive performance drops to the point of being unusable.     Once
enabled, it takes about 10 minutes for ParaView to update the GL window.
I've tried diddling with the render window settings - such totally disabling
distributed rendering, but it doesn't seem to make any difference on the
performance with opacity.

I've also saved out animations of this dataset and use the "disconnect"
feature.    Without opacity enabled, I can march through time at something
slightly less than 1 timestep/minute running in disconnected batch mode.
With opacity enabled on any one of the parts,  it takes ~10
minutes/timestep.       

On the server side, I have paraview 4.0.1 built with the OSMesa library
that's downloaded as part of the superbuild.    I'm assuming that opacity
should not totally destroy performance as we're seeing.     There are other
packages that we use in client-server mode with opacity that show no
noticeable performance degradation when using opacity.  

Thanks

Hi all, I can get the properly mangled names and MPI_Fortran_* errors to disappear by also exporting FC (didn't know if F77 was needed) in configcross.sh. If I have problems building a test coprocessing program, I'll start a new thread.

Hi,

If I remember correctly, the CFortranInterface utility essentially works in a separate process space so that it doesn't affect any of the CMake settings for the current configuration. This may be a better topic for the CMake list. I'll check with some people today to see about what could be done with it.

Hi Mark,

Yes, I discovered the same thing yesterday. The reason is that CMake picks up /usr/bin/c++ and /usr/bin/cc automatically which are symlinked to g++-4.3 and gcc-4.3 on Titan. I tried to change CMAKE_C++_COMPILER and CMAKE_C_COMPILER manually through ccmake, however, the changes did not get populated down to subdirectories such as Catalyst sub-directory for some reason. After I manually corrected them over all CMakeCache.txt files down in every subdirectories, FortranCInterface can build successfully. I am currently building cross stage also. Hopefully this is it.

Thanks,
Hong

Hi Hong and David,

I was able to get FortranCInterface to build in the tools directory. Even though we were doing module load gcc, CMake was picking up $CC and $CXX as gcc 4.3.4, instead of gcc 4.7.2 like it should have. The fix is to do as in configcross.sh and export CC and CXX,

So my configtools.sh is now

I just started a cross compile based on that and will report back when that finishes.

Thanks, Mark. It is good to know it is not only me having this problem. I found if I remove "-L/usr/lib64/gcc/x86_64-suse-linux/4.3  -L/usr/x86_64-suse-linux/lib" from the build line, I can successfully build FortranCInterface. So the question now becomes how I can remove those two lib paths within CMake so that it can build FortranCInterface and set corresponding flags correctly. Let me know if anybody has some pointers on how to do that within CMake.

Thanks,
Hong

I have the same errors in my CMakeError.log, if I understand what's going on right, those symbols are defined in libgcc_s.so in the same directory, and so that lib isn't being linked?

-----------------

Could you confirm whether you are getting this error also for your superbuild on Titan? If you are not seeing these errors, could you confirm whether you are using the default gcc version 4.7.2 or some newer version?

Superbuild is able to build other libraries successfully for me on Titan except for this FortranCInterface problems, so I am hoping to confirm with you to see whether this is a specific problem on my part.

Thanks for all your help!

Your tools build is pointing to the compiler wrapper that you normally would use to make code for the back end.
The tools build should just use plain old local gcc since we only build things at that point that run on the login node.

Try these setup scripts:
I source configtools.sh to set up my environment before I build the compile tools, and configcross.sh before before I cross compile ParaView.

configtools.sh
#use my own cmake, system one is too old
setenv PATH /autofs/na4_proj/csc035/demarle/pvdev/titan/cmake-build/bin:${PATH}
#switch compiler to compile code for front end
module unload PrgEnv-pgi
module load gcc
#configure settings for to build compile tools only
cmake \
  -DCROSS_BUILD_STAGE:STRING=TOOLS -Dcross_target:STRING=xk7_gnu \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Release \
  -DBUILD_TESTING:BOOL=FALSE \

  -DENABLE_paraview:BOOL=TRUE \
  -DENABLE_boost:BOOL=TRUE \
  -DENABLE_python:BOOL=TRUE \
  -DENABLE_portfwd:BOOL=FALSE \
  ../../ParaViewSuperbuild


then make

configcross.sh

setenv PATH /autofs/na4_proj/csc035/demarle/pvdev/titan/cmake-build/bin:${PATH}
#switch compiler to compile code for back end

Thanks for the update, Mark. I can also get rid of FortranCmangling errors for cross build by adding "fortran" into line 137 of FindMPI.cmake so it reads:


foreach (lang C CXX Fortran)

This allows superbuild to find MPI_Fortran automatically in the same way as finding MPI_C and MPI_CXX. I am currently half way through the cross build, but I verified the errors/warnings disappeared and an output message indicating FortranCMangling and FortranCInterface are found and working, so it looks like everything is good now...

Hi,

If I remember correctly, the CFortranInterface utility essentially works in a separate process space so that it doesn't affect any of the CMake settings for the current configuration. This may be a better topic for the CMake list. I'll check with some people today to see about what could be done with it.

Hi Mark,

Yes, I discovered the same thing yesterday. The reason is that CMake picks up /usr/bin/c++ and /usr/bin/cc automatically which are symlinked to g++-4.3 and gcc-4.3 on Titan. I tried to change CMAKE_C++_COMPILER and CMAKE_C_COMPILER manually through ccmake, however, the changes did not get populated down to subdirectories such as Catalyst sub-directory for some reason. After I manually corrected them over all CMakeCache.txt files down in every subdirectories, FortranCInterface can build successfully. I am currently building cross stage also. Hopefully this is it.

Thanks,

Hi Hong and David,

I was able to get FortranCInterface to build in the tools directory. Even though we were doing module load gcc, CMake was picking up $CC and $CXX as gcc 4.3.4, instead of gcc 4.7.2 like it should have. The fix is to do as in configcross.sh and export CC and CXX,

So my configtools.sh is now

module load gcc
export CC=/opt/gcc/4.7.2/bin/gcc
export CXX=/opt/gcc/4.7.2/bin/g++
#configure settings to build compile tools only

cmake \
-DCROSS_BUILD_STAGE:STRING=TOOLS -Dcross_target:STRING=xk7_gnu \
-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Release \
-DBUILD_TESTING:BOOL=FALSE \

-DENABLE_paraview:BOOL=TRUE \
-DENABLE_boost:BOOL=TRUE \

I just started a cross compile based on that and will report back when that finishes.

Thanks, Mark. It is good to know it is not only me having this problem. I found if I remove "-L/usr/lib64/gcc/x86_64-suse-linux/4.3  -L/usr/x86_64-suse-linux/lib" from the build line, I can successfully build FortranCInterface. So the question now becomes how I can remove those two lib paths within CMake so that it can build FortranCInterface and set corresponding flags correctly. Let me know if anybody has some pointers on how to do that within CMake.

Thanks,
Hong

This makes sense - my update was yesterday, then when I had issues, I blew the tree totally away and started from scratch.  One of the failures had your name Seb on one of the cmake files from two days ago.  One thing that was crazy on an earlier make install is that it was trying to copy a vtk directory into the executable file "/projects/viz/paraview/ParaView/4.1.0-alan/Linux-eng-sci-rhel6-x86_64/lib/paraview-4.0/paraview" as though paraview was also a directory.  Obviously, not possible.

Thanks for the reply!

Hi Alan,

This might be related to the part that we are currently working on with Dave about the Python build/install rules.
If that's the case this should be fixed by the next gatekeeper review.

But that can only be the case if this is based on a very recent source tree (a week old at most)

That's ok, I already had some cake earlier... No need for cookies. ;-)

So just to make sure. Once you blow the build tree away, did it worked? Or
not?

Thanks,

No, it did not work after a new pull, and scratch build.  Bug changed, and the error at the bottom of this e-mail is what I now see.  Previously, before blowing my tree away, it was trying to copy a vtk directory into the lib/paraview-4.0/paraview executable.

Hi Alan,

This might be related to the part that we are currently working on with Dave about the Python build/install rules.
If that's the case this should be fixed by the next gatekeeper review.

But that can only be the case if this is based on a very recent source tree (a week old at most)

Subject: [Paraview] Distance between points X Precision
Message-ID: <CAE=GJramwpivgVi0n8+5V7zq4Tg6FcEO=yExx1bRHzApLv6FLg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have a bunch of points, animated with the method of a bunch of csv files
with the same name like Anim000,Anim001,Anim002,...,Anim900.

It`s a lot of points and the distance between seem to be not big enough for
the camera, so i can`t see a curvature in the animation, it`s like a
straight line going up, not moving right/left how it  was supposed to do.

I thougt about prolonging the axis, or rescaling them but i dont know how i
would do that

I tried to multiply all the numbers by a 10^10,10^20,10^32 but it did not
help

Can someone help me, giving me a tip of how can i prolong the axis or with
any other idea, like a mathematical one to reproduce the numbers another
way so the distance gets percetible?

Sorry for the bad english!

Thanks in advance!

Hi, I think I have a complete ParaView superbuild on Titan. I'm trying to get the wiki C++ coprocessing example to compile and get the following:

Scanning dependencies of target CoProcessingExample
[100%] Building CXX object CMakeFiles/CoProcessingExample.dir/CoProcessingExample.cxx.o

The headers are scattered in paraview/src/paraview, e.g.
${CROSS}/paraview/src/paraview/CoProcessing/Catalyst/vtkCPInputDataDescription.h

How do I tell superbuild to create an include directory? I see a patch from Utkarsh about the paraviewsdk, approved on 8/9, should I apply that?

I would suggest just setting the ParaView path to <superbuild build
dir>/paraview/src/paraview-build. This of course assumes that you're
executable is built with CMake such that it can get the include paths from
there. If not, maybe someone else can chime in with how to build the
paraviewsdk with superbuild.

I have ParaView_DIR set to that in ccmake, is that what you mean, or is there another variable?

I also had many problems working with transparency using paraview. My case was probably slightly different as the data is completely unstructured (I'm not familiar with CTH datasets), and the partitioning code in paraview was taking very long and executing repeatedly.

I'd like to write a long email to describe the work I've been doing on transparency for our meshes.... but 
There is a section in this paper "Juan Hernando, John Biddiscombe, Bidur Bohara, Stefan Eilemann, Felix Sch?rmann: Practical Parallel Rendering of Detailed Neuron Simulations. EGPGV 2013: 49-56"
ftp://ftp.cscs.ch/out/biddisco/bbp/neurons-egpgv13.pdf
which describes the changes/plugins to paraview. Space was scarce so the writeup of the paraview part is not enough, but might give you a good overview of the work.

Most of the partitioning and fast rendering on GPU is available (albeit in experimental form) in the pv-zoltan plugin from here https://hpcforge.org/projects/pv-zoltan/ 

Feel free to ask questions if this might help you in your work.

Message-ID: <CAJGHi7HnOzLQbD6Dv6_+THYQZ5MtY_pLeYin5bZQF2X=_B-tEA@mail.gmail.com>

Time ago I asked for help to visualise isocurves like this pictures
using wind speed data:
http://i.imgur.com/OmUXWWj.png

In the forum it was suggested to use Calculator linked with contour
filter. I tried to learn how to use calculator filter but I can't
understand how I should write the expressions to  get the data.

Someone knows a tutorial for a similar purpose explaining how operate
with the calculator?

Short story:

Not done yet. It has been taking more patience than I expected. I expect to
have it early next week.

Long story:

I've had a nearly working bgq_xlc target for mira since last Thursday.

Unfortunately it fails at final link time of the executables with this
message:

/bgsys/drivers/ppcfloor/gnu-linux/powerpc64-bgq-linux/bin/ld:
/bgsys/drivers/V1R2M0/ppc64/comm/sys/lib/libpami.a(component-pami--CAPI.cnk.o)(.text._ZNSt8_Rb_treeIjSt4pairIKjjESt10_Select1stIS2_ESt4lessIjESaIS2_EE8_M_eraseEPSt13_Rb_tree_nodeIS2_E[_ZNSt8_Rb_treeIjSt4pairIKjjESt10_Select1stIS2_ESt4lessIjESaIS2_EE8_M_eraseEPSt13_Rb_tree_nodeIS2_E]+0xbc):
sibling call optimization to
`_ZNSt8_Rb_treeIjSt4pairIKjjESt10_Select1stIS2_ESt4lessIjESaIS2_EE8_M_eraseEPSt13_Rb_tree_nodeIS2_E'
does not allow automatic multiple TOCs; recompile with -mminimal-toc or
-fno-optimize-sibling-calls, or make
`_ZNSt8_Rb_treeIjSt4pairIKjjESt10_Select1stIS2_ESt4lessIjESaIS2_EE8_M_eraseEPSt13_Rb_tree_nodeIS2_E'
extern

Which would seem to indicate that the global symbol table of contents is
overflowing.
See:
 https://trac.mcs.anl.gov/projects/ITAPS/wiki/BuildingOnBgq
This was never an issue on intrepid and I have not yet found a combination
of compiler flags that gets around the issue.

Since I'm stalled on that front I've made a bgq_gnu target for comparison
and in the hopes that the different compiler flags available might resolve
it. So far that target will build mesa and python fully but can not yet
compile ParaView.

Hello,

I am trying to install Paraview from the Linux 64bit binary, but there  
are symbolic links embedded in the tar archive that prevent the  
archive extraction from completing. I did not have the same extraction  
problem with the 32 bit version (but I do need the 64 bit version).  
Can you advise?

Thanks,

I found some of my copious spare time lying around and submitted a patch to Gerrit (topic 3235). If you can review, I'll merge.

Hi Mark,

Yes, ParaView_DIR is what needs to be set with that value.

Hi Curtis,

are you talking about the nightly ones or the release ones?
I'm asking as the current nightly might be broken in some manner.

Subject: [Paraview] time step from within a programmable filter
Message-ID: <BFCCA75C-D0C3-48CB-8633-B0ACC0E65D0A@anl.gov>

Hi, all,

I believe there must be a way to do this, but thus far all of my attempts have been unsuccessful.  I have a programmable filter which calculates a new scalar field, which I then would like to write some information about to a file.  This much I have working successfully. I would now like to animate through a time series, applying this filter, and writing out a separate file for each time step.  So, from within this programmable filter I'd like to get the current time step (either the index or the actual time value, or perhaps the file name of the current step, any of these would work) in order to generate filenames that map back to the original data.  Any advice on how to do this would be appreciated.

Thanks,
joe

Subject: [Paraview] Statically linking catalyst to fortran simulation code
	on Titan
Message-ID: <65F8B323A072504ABFC5D3D8751910514FEB53BC@MAIL-MBX2.ad.renci.org>

I am able to successfully build our Fortran simulation code as well as Catalyst Fortran example code linked to catalyst (built with superbuild), but the resulting executable is not static, but have some dependencies on shared libraries such as libmpichf90_gnu_47.so.1, limxpmem.so.1, etc., which seems to be resulting from "find_package(MPI)" in CMakeLists.txt that somehow find shared mpi libraries to link to. This dependencies prevents the executables from running on Titan compute nodes. Since paraview superbuild cross target can generate pvserver as well as other executables statically without any dependencies on other shared libraries, I have been trying to study paraview superbuild trying to build Catalyst in-situ Fortran example code also statically without any dependencies, but have not been able to succeed. I guess one way to do it is to manually specify all those MPI static libraries in CMake, however, I have not been able to succeed due to so many dependencies of those MPI libraries. Could anyone advise on how to achieve static linking to MPI libraries automatically by CMake via find_package(MPI)?

Thanks,
Hong

I preset these config flags to make sure I got the static MPI libs.

list(APPEND PARAVIEW_OPTIONS "-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS:BOOL=OFF")
list(APPEND PARAVIEW_OPTIONS "-DPARAVIEW_USE_MPI:BOOL=ON")
list(APPEND PARAVIEW_OPTIONS
"-DMPI_INCLUDE_DIRS:STRING=/opt/cray/mpt/5.5.5/gni/mpich2-gnu/47/include")
list(APPEND PARAVIEW_OPTIONS
"-DMPI_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=/opt/cray/mpt/5.5.5/gni/mpich2-gnu/47/lib/libmpich.a")
list(APPEND PARAVIEW_OPTIONS
"-DMPI_EXTRA_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=/opt/cray/mpt/5.5.5/gni/mpich2-gnu/47/lib/libmpichcxx.a")
list(APPEND PARAVIEW_OPTIONS "-DVTK_USE_SYSTEM_HDF5:BOOL=1")

It is likely the case that presetting these in your simulation code will
make it choose the right ones too:
list(APPEND PARAVIEW_OPTIONS
"-DMPI_INCLUDE_DIRS:STRING=/opt/cray/mpt/5.5.5/gni/mpich2-gnu/47/include")
list(APPEND PARAVIEW_OPTIONS

Thanks for the info, David. I did try setting all these flags you indicated when building simulation code and Catalyst Fortran example code with CMake, but it does not seem to help. Let me know if you have any other suggestions.

They are overridden in the CMakeCache then? Ie you preset them and
something later changes them.

In situations like that cmake --trace is helpful. It tells cmake to spit
out everything it does to the terminal. Pipe that into a file, and then
grep the file for the cmake variable in question. You will be able to see
what exactly set it incorrectly.

It will also be helpful to take a look at the FindMPI module itself, as
that is the most likely culprit. By reading that it might become apparent.

good luck!

If I remember correctly, FindMPI.cmake is trying to set the language
specific libraries (e.g. MPI_CXX_LIBRARIES) and if those aren't set then it
will try to find them and finally overwrite what is in MPI_LIBRARY. So I
would suggest changing what Dave D. suggested with
MPI_{C,CXX,Fortran}_LIBRARIES set in addition to setting MPI_LIBRARY. If
you look at FindMPI.cmake, you'll see that MPI_LIBRARY and
MPI_EXTRA_LIBRARY are deprecated.

Subject: [Paraview] StreamTracer streamlines not terminating reliably at
	exterior boundary
Message-ID: <5232B5F8.4090408@uni-tuebingen.de>

Hello everyone,

I have a problem with the StreamTracer filter in ParaView 4.01 64bit on 
Linux: Some of the streamlines continue past the exterior boundary of 
the input dataset (see attached screenshot). This happens with all 
integrator types and is independent of the initial and minimum step lengths.

Is there something wrong with my input data (see attached)? Perhaps the 
exterior boundary needs to be set explicitly in some way?

Thanks for your help

Looks as though the parts outside the box are all linear. what I suspect is happening is that the findCell routine is returning true off the edge of the dataset and the last velocity is being reused even though the internal interpolation ought to fail. To fix it one would have to check the tolerance being used on the findcell locator and tweak it accordingly. from the paraview gui there's not much you can do, but if you were building from source, you could see if this was a problem with the locator. Might be that the dataset is 2D and for whatever reason the locator is behaving badly. It's certainly a bug anyway.

If I have some spare time later (I won't) I'll step through the code and see what's going wrong.

Anyway, you're stuffed for now, so you'd better submit a bug report.

I write a simple reader,inheriting from vtkPolyDataAlgorithm.But
SetScalars() cannot color the plane.When I test it use general vtk
polydata->mapper->actor->renderer->renderwindow,I can see different color
at different point.Does someone know the reason?Thank you.

I'm not sure I understand; are you having problems loading the data into ParaView or saving the results as a VTK dataset?

WHat is the type of scalar array? If it's not an unsigned char array with 3
or 4 components, VTK will use a lookuptable to map the scalar to colors.

Thanks for all the useful info, David, and Andy.

After spending a lot of time looking into Cmake trace aLINK_SEARCH_END_STATICnd FindMPI.cmake, I finally resolved this problem by setting on LINK_SEARCH_START_STATIC and LINK_SEARCH_END_STATIC flags. Now the resulting executable is static and I can run in-situ viz with our simulation on Titan. However, I don't see the slice images generated by Catalyst as set up in the python pipeline although the output message indicated that coprocessing was called and returned with no error. I am going to look into the code next to investigate further, but a quick relevant question in my mind is: is this one static executable sufficient to run on the compute node or I have to copy over python modules and set python path appropriately for the pipeline to be executed by Catalyst?

Thanks and regards,

Hong

If I remember correctly, FindMPI.cmake is trying to set the language specific libraries (e.g. MPI_CXX_LIBRARIES) and if those aren't set then it will try to find them and finally overwrite what is in MPI_LIBRARY. So I would suggest changing what Dave D. suggested with MPI_{C,CXX,Fortran}_LIBRARIES set in addition to setting MPI_LIBRARY. If you look at FindMPI.cmake, you'll see that MPI_LIBRARY and MPI_EXTRA_LIBRARY are deprecated.

They are overridden in the CMakeCache then? Ie you preset them and something later changes them.

In situations like that cmake --trace is helpful. It tells cmake to spit out everything it does to the terminal. Pipe that into a file, and then grep the file for the cmake variable in question. You will be able to see what exactly set it incorrectly.

It will also be helpful to take a look at the FindMPI module itself, as that is the most likely culprit. By reading that it might become apparent.

good luck!

I preset these config flags to make sure I got the static MPI libs.

list(APPEND PARAVIEW_OPTIONS "-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS:BOOL=OFF")
list(APPEND PARAVIEW_OPTIONS "-DPARAVIEW_USE_MPI:BOOL=ON")
list(APPEND PARAVIEW_OPTIONS "-DMPI_INCLUDE_DIRS:STRING=/opt/cray/mpt/5.5.5/gni/mpich2-gnu/47/include")
list(APPEND PARAVIEW_OPTIONS "-DMPI_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=/opt/cray/mpt/5.5.5/gni/mpich2-gnu/47/lib/libmpich.a")
list(APPEND PARAVIEW_OPTIONS "-DMPI_EXTRA_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=/opt/cray/mpt/5.5.5/gni/mpich2-gnu/47/lib/libmpichcxx.a")
list(APPEND PARAVIEW_OPTIONS "-DVTK_USE_SYSTEM_HDF5:BOOL=1")

It is likely the case that presetting these in your simulation code will make it choose the right ones too:
list(APPEND PARAVIEW_OPTIONS "-DMPI_INCLUDE_DIRS:STRING=/opt/cray/mpt/5.5.5/gni/mpich2-gnu/47/include")
list(APPEND PARAVIEW_OPTIONS "-DMPI_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=/opt/cray/mpt/5.5.5/gni/mpich2-gnu/47/lib/libmpich.a")
list(APPEND PARAVIEW_OPTIONS "-DMPI_EXTRA_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=/opt/cray/mpt/5.5.5/gni/mpich2-gnu/47/lib/libmpichcxx.a")

I am able to successfully build our Fortran simulation code as well as Catalyst Fortran example code linked to catalyst (built with superbuild), but the resulting executable is not static, but have some dependencies on shared libraries such as libmpichf90_gnu_47.so.1, limxpmem.so.1, etc., which seems to be resulting from ?find_package(MPI)? in CMakeLists.txt that somehow find shared mpi libraries to link to. This dependencies prevents the executables from running on Titan compute nodes. Since paraview superbuild cross target can generate pvserver as well as other executables statically without any dependencies on other shared libraries, I have been trying to study paraview superbuild trying to build Catalyst in-situ Fortran example code also statically without any dependencies, but have not been able to succeed. I guess one way to do it is to manually specify all those MPI static libraries in CMake, however, I have not been able to succeed due to so many dependencies of those MPI libraries. Could anyone advise on how to achieve static linking to MPI libraries automatically by CMake via find_package(MPI)?

Great news on getting it to compile and link!

Pretty sure that the statically built python and paraview python modules
need to be accessible from the compute nodes as well.
I would have expected something worse to show up in the log but definately
try this first.

What I do is put $cross/install/lib (python itself) and
$cross/paraview/src/paraview-build/lib/site-packages (paraview's python
modules) somewhere on lustre (like next to where I put
$cross/parview/src/paraview-build/bin), and set PYTHONHOME and PYTHONPATH
in my pbs script to point to the python and the modules respectively.

Why do I get such a strange error?I can find setName() function at

My paraview version is 4.0.1.
the master code is as below:

vtkFloatArray *pointScalars = vtkFloatArray::New();
pointScalars->setName("Velocity");

******************************************
I also find similar code in GMVReader plugin source,which is part of
paraview source,but without compile error.

Hi, George.

I had noticed the visit bridge subsystem while perusing the codebase, 
but I wasn't sure if it was used or not. I have it working now, but I 
made a small modification to the Cosmo Gadget reader that really makes 
things very nice. By changing the tag attribute from the particle ID to 
the particle type (i.e., dark matter, gas, stars, etc.) I am able to use 
the threshold mechanism to show only the particle types I want. I have 
attached an example image showing only the disk stars from the 
simulation output I provided previously. Once I add gas to my 
simulations, I can then use the tag to colorize the particles to further 
distinguish gas and stars. This isn't possible to do with the visit 
bridge as it does not store the mass (or if it does, it does not show it 
as a colorization value).

This change really only works because I can ignore the particle IDs as 
my particles are not split across multiple input files, so it's not 
really a production-ready solution to getting Gadget visualizations into 
ParaView.

Let me know if I can be of any help with testing ParaView changes with 
Gadget data.

Many thanks for all of your help.

- Tim

P.S. An oddity I noticed between the Cosmo Gadget reader and the Visit 
Bridge one is that the Visit Bridge reader expects the Gadget2 
"enhanced" snapshot format (i.e., SnapFormat=2), but expects the file 
extension '.gadget'. While the Cosmo Reader uses the old Gadget format 
(i.e., SnapFormat=1), but expects the file extension '.gadget2'. It's 
only a small wart, though!

Why do I get such a strange error?I can find setName() function at http://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkFloatArray-members.html
My paraview version is 4.0.1.
the master code is as below:
******************************************
vtkFloatArray *pointScalars = vtkFloatArray::New();
pointScalars->setName("Velocity");

******************************************
I also find similar code in GMVReader plugin source,which is part of paraview source,but without compile error.

Message-ID: <CAM3A=6jzo+cqqCJ9_zPxiERDD2eYd=2dUSkSdbyQVZ_Fj1+ChQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am using a phase-field model to understand microstructure evolution in a
smart material.

The particular phase in microstructure is defined by when the value of
defined parameter is more than its threshold value. I plotted the isovolume
of a phase. There are two phases which are defined separately by using
isovolumes of two predefined parameters.

Now, I would like to plot the volumetric evolution of these two phases.
What filter is used to find a volume of an isovolume entity?  What
rendering mode is best for this operation ?

The results file are too big to upload on the mail.

Please share your expertise.
Thank you.

Warm regards,
Rakesh

I don't know if there is any point in subclassing those classes, but to answer your question, the object you get in the output vector is the same object created in a previous call to RequestDataObject.

Subject: [Paraview] d3plot transform to vtk file
Message-ID: <736035.24538.qm@web100919.mail.kks.yahoo.co.jp>

Dear all?

I want to observe pressure fluctuation on central axis in paraview.
I use LS-DYNA.

In ls-prepost, I can't observe pressure fluctuation on central axis. So, I decided to use paraview.
I can indicate pressure to use ls-prepost but I can't it in paraview.
So, I ?thought if d3plot transformed to vtk format, I can indicate pressure in paraview.?
I want to convert d3polt file to vtk format to indicate pressure in paraview.
However I don't understand that methods.
So, please tell me how to convert d3plot file to vtk.
Should I use lsdynareader??

Thank you?
Best regards
Yusuke

Many thanks for the info, David. Yes, I can get the Catalyst Fortran example running as expected on Titan now after setting up Python as you indicated below. However, I still cannot get expected coprocessing output from our simulation code since requestdatadescription() always returns 0 for the need flag for each time step, hence no further coprocessing is done. At this stage, python coprocessing script is not even touched yet (no corresponding pyc file is generated). Not sure at this point what causes requestdatadescription() to return 0 indicating no need to do coprocessing further, but will investigate further trying to resolve the issue and will start a new thread if I have specific questions to ask along the way.

Thank you again for all your help!

Best regards,
Hong

Great news on getting it to compile and link!

Pretty sure that the statically built python and paraview python modules need to be accessible from the compute nodes as well.
I would have expected something worse to show up in the log but definately try this first.

What I do is put $cross/install/lib (python itself) and $cross/paraview/src/paraview-build/lib/site-packages (paraview's python modules) somewhere on lustre (like next to where I put $cross/parview/src/paraview-build/bin), and set PYTHONHOME and PYTHONPATH in my pbs script to point to the python and the modules respectively.

Hi

I have  a represented bathymetry of  a shore, and inside of it there's
fluid trajectories.

The problem is, the bathymetry have a extension of kilometers and the
trajectories side deslocations happens in meters, so its like a straight up
line, i cant see the curvatures

Can someone give a tip of how can i interpolate the data so i can see
curvatures, or a way to rescale my lateral axis or something like that,
like the precision of the data or the precision of paraview

Hi Yusuke,

I'm not sure what you mean by "central axis". Do you mean the central axis of the simulation or the middle layer of a thick shell element? If the latter, note that the LS-DYNA file format only stores fluid pressure information at nodes or on SPH particles. If the shell elements do not have nodes on their middle layer, then no pressure information is available there and you will have to interpolate it.

Also, are you sure the pressure variable is being saved in the d3plot file? LS-DYNA may be configured to save pressure or not. 

Finally, there are other files (the time history database: d3thdt; the interface force database: intfor) that VTK's LS-DYNA does not support but that LS-PrePost is able to read. If the pressure information you want is stored in these files, VTK will not be able to read it.

	David

You can use the calculator filter to scale the values in a field. You can also use the transform filter to scale the physical positions.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [Paraview] Points Movements - Kilometrical extension x metrical movement

Hi

I have  a represented bathymetry of  a shore, and inside of it there's fluid trajectories.

The problem is, the bathymetry have a extension of kilometers and the trajectories side deslocations happens in meters, so its like a straight up line, i cant see the curvatures

Can someone give a tip of how can i interpolate the data so i can see curvatures, or a way to rescale my lateral axis or something like that, like the precision of the data or the precision of paraview

Many thanks for the info, David. Yes, I can get the Catalyst Fortran example running as expected on Titan now after setting up Python as you indicated below. However, I still cannot get expected coprocessing output from our simulation code since requestdatadescription() always returns 0 for the need flag for each time step, hence no further coprocessing is done. At this stage, python coprocessing script is not even touched yet (no corresponding pyc file is generated). Not sure at this point what causes requestdatadescription() to return 0 indicating no need to do coprocessing further, but will investigate further trying to resolve the issue and will start a new thread if I have specific questions to ask along the way.

Thank you again for all your help!

Best regards,
Hong

Great news on getting it to compile and link!

Pretty sure that the statically built python and paraview python modules need to be accessible from the compute nodes as well.
I would have expected something worse to show up in the log but definately try this first.

What I do is put $cross/install/lib (python itself) and $cross/paraview/src/paraview-build/lib/site-packages (paraview's python modules) somewhere on lustre (like next to where I put $cross/parview/src/paraview-build/bin), and set PYTHONHOME and PYTHONPATH in my pbs script to point to the python and the modules respectively.

(Posting this back to the mailing list. I didn't realize we left it.)

Once again assuming I understand your problem (and I'm not sure I totally do), you have a large surface area of land that is much much larger than any change in surface elevation. Thus, you cannot see the change in depth and everything looks like it is a plane (or slightly curved surface depending on how you transform it).

This is a pretty common problem in visualizing ocean, atmosphere, and similar geographical topics. The distance from the deepest ocean trenches to the peak of the tallest mountains is tiny compared to the area of the surface. To see anything of interest, you will probably have to stretch the geometry radially.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] Re: [Paraview] Points Movements - Kilometrical extension x metrical movement

 I guess the physical [x,y,z] coordinates of the shore geometry should be interpreted as [latitude (degrees), longitude (degrees), elevation (kilometers)]. I suppose the trajectory positions would be stored as [latitude (degrees), longitude (degrees), elevation (meters)]. If that is the case, just do a transform with scale values of [1,1,1000].


THAT'S 100% CORRECT. I already did that 1,1,1000 when i transform the data from .dat to .txt

It`s everything in the place where it should be.

The thing now, is that the shore extension go to -30 to -16 degrees ( a lot of kilometers, i heard that 1 degree its like 110 km)

The trajectories while under the earth level have a side dislocation too small compared to the extension of the shore, because of that i can only see a line going up, not moving right/left.

I think the paraview precision is causing it so i dont think(maybe i can, but dont know how, thats why i am asking) i can do too much with paraview

but in the other hand, i can do something with the data, so it will at least give me an idea of an curvature

in one of my tries i rescale all the data by 1000, ^2, but i just get the same thing with diferent numbers




i am ploting points over time(lot of  ****1.csv, ****2.csv,.....)






2013/9/16 Moreland, Kenneth <kmorel at sandia.gov<mailto:kmorel at sandia.gov>>
I guess I don't really understand your problem. Latitude and longitude are of course in degrees or some other angular measurement, not meters or kilometers. Presumably the latitude and longitude have the same units for the shore and the trajectories or you would have said something about that.

So I'm going to start guessing to fill in the details. I guess the physical [x,y,z] coordinates of the shore geometry should be interpreted as [latitude (degrees), longitude (degrees), elevation (kilometers)]. I suppose the trajectory positions would be stored as [latitude (degrees), longitude (degrees), elevation (meters)]. If that is the case, just do a transform with scale values of [1,1,1000].

Or maybe there is more to it than that. You mentioned something about dislocations. Perhaps you mean displacements, but displacements of what? Or maybe the trajectories/displacements are in Cartesian coordinates instead of lat-lon spherical coordinates. In that case, you must be doing something to convert between the two, which I would think rescaling from meters to kilometers could happen then.

Anyway, without more information I don't think I can help.

It`s not that simple

The position is given by Latitude(x) and Longitude(y)
If i just scale the values, i have to do in both fields, and then i just get the same representation with bigger values
I think it will only be possible to see something that look like a curvature if  i do something mathematicly with the distance between consecutive points, but i dont know waht to do



2013/9/16 Moreland, Kenneth <kmorel at sandia.gov<mailto:kmorel at sandia.gov>>
You can use the calculator filter to scale the values in a field. You can also use the transform filter to scale the physical positions.

Hi Andy,

Okay, I must not understand something about CMake then. I tried ParaView_DIR and it still can't find the header files. However, I found that if I go into the Adaptors directory I can build libPhastaAdaptor.a

Do I need to be building my projects inside of the $cross/paraview/src tree?

I would suggest just setting the ParaView path to <superbuild build dir>/paraview/src/paraview-build. This of course assumes that you're executable is built with CMake such that it can get the include paths from there. If not, maybe someone else can chime in with how to build the paraviewsdk with superbuild.

Message-ID: <CE5DC5B8.106B0%kmorel@sandia.gov>

The convention for making a reader that accepts multiple files is to first implement a pair of methods in the reader to add file names one at a time and another method to reset the list of file names. Here is some example declarations that would be in the reader's header file.

  // Description:
  // Adds names of files to be read. The files are read in the order
  // they are added.
  virtual void AddFileName(const char* fname);

  // Description:
  // Remove all file names.
  virtual void RemoveAllFileNames();

Then in your reader xml file of the SourceProxy declare a StringVectorProperty with a FileListDomain. Here is an example of that.

      <StringVectorProperty animateable="0"
                            clean_command="RemoveAllFileNames"
                            command="AddFileName"
                            name="FileNames"
                            number_of_elements="0"
                            panel_visibility="never"
                            repeat_command="1">
        <FileListDomain name="files" />

Hong,

Would you mind sharing you CMakeCache (both at the superbuild and paraview
sub build) with me?

I would like to fold your work into ParaViewSuperbuild so that the next

Hmm, it's tough for me to diagnose what's going on. I wonder if this was
the same issue Hong was having with the Fortran adaptor stuff. It sounds
like something is missing in the cross build. You can potentially fix it by
going into $cross/paraview/src/paraview-build and running ccmake from their
to reconfigure and then recompile in that directory. If I remember
correctly, you may want to set the MPI_{C,CXX,Fortran}_LIBRARY. If that
doesn't work you may want to consider setting the Fortran compiler as well
if it's set to something reasonable. Note that this has the potential to
wipe out all of your CMake cache though since CMake may think that the
compiler has changed and it needs to regenerate all of the CMake info again.

I'd go through Hong's emails and the responses to see what was done. Maybe
sharing your CMakeCache.txt files from both the superbuild directory and
the $cross/paraview/src/paraview-build directory would help figure out some
issues.

Regards,
Andy

Message-ID: <CAD=53WcTmtumriP-ei4RvAAtx7ne4Zzf38EA1cnj5sY8+8pQJw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I tried to test ParaViewWeb by following this simple tutorial:
http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaViewWeb

Unfortunately I receive a "404 - No Such Resource" error. If I start the
server without the "--content www" flag, I can connect and get another
window opens which shows the little axis widget of ParaView; other than
that I cannot do anything.

Am I missing something?

I have used the latest ParaView binary on a 64bit openSUSE 12.2 system.

Best regards,
Oliver

Hi Oliver,

you seems pretty close to have it working.
What is the script that you started and what is the URL that you connect to?

Thanks,

Seb

Hi Tim,

I was able to open the dataset you provided. Here are a couple of
suggestions:

(1) Make sure to uncheck the "Cosmo Format" checkbox -- this will ensure
that the underlying reader will read in the data as a Gadget file.

(2) Set "rL", i.e., the box-size of the simulation data accordingly

(3) Set overlap to 0 -- This parameter creates ghost zones between
inter-processor and periodic boundaries which you may need if you are
running this in parallel, depending on what you want to do after you read
in the data.

Attached is an image of what the output looks like when I do the above with
rL=100.

Best,
George

By the way, another alternative is to enable VisItBridge -- turn
PARAVIEW_USE_VISITBRIDGE to ON when you build ParaView -- and use the
Gadget reader that is available through visit bridge. Currently, it expects
a "*.gadget" extension. Attached is a figure of the dataset you shared with
us, opened with that reader. This might be a better alternative in the
short term.

I have played with the parameters without success.

Could you please advice?

I suspect you have two problems, both related to the fact that your data is 2D and the stream tracer performs its calculations in 3D.

The first problem is that the default seed source, named Point Source, is really a point cloud of random points within a sphere of a given radius. When picking points in this 3D sphere, it is unlikely that any will happen to hit the surface. Change to the line source, which will by default lie on the correct plane.

The second problem is that your vectors are not quite parallel with the plane. They have a Z component that is, while small, not exactly 0. Thus, after one step the particle advection has moved off the plane enough for the locator to determine that the stream has left the mesh. You can fix this by first passing your data through the calculator filter and give the expression "momentum_X*iHat + momentum_Y*jHat".

After doing those two things I got streamlines to work fine on the data you posted.

Hello Dave,

seems today I came across the same problem as the one reported on Tue, 
Aug 28, 2012 at 5:59 AM by Carolin Helbig. Please see my screenshot 
attached.

Untoggling "Mask Points" is not a solution because then the number of 
glyphs would be too large.

Increasing "Maximum Number of Points" is not a solution because this 
only increases the density of glyphs in the area where they are visible 
in the attached screenshot.

Any suggestions to overcome this problem would be very welcome.

Marcus

Marcus,

It's a known bug on Windows
(http://paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=14279). We will address it by the
next release. Unfortunately, I'm not sure there's a good workaround
for now -- maybe run the Decimate filter to reduce the dataset and
then glyph it without masking points?

Another way to reduce the dataset size is to use the Mask Points filter
after your Calculator filter.

The instructions I gave are for if you are programming your own reader for a ParaView plugin. If you are using an existing reader and cannot or do not want to change the software, the easiest thing to do is probably to load in the group as you are to get those 10 objects in the Pipeline Browser. Then select all of those objects and apply the Group Datasets filter. You can then apply further filters to that group an it will be applied to all data.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] Re: [Paraview] How does paraview pass multiple filenames to reader plugin?

If I have 10 files,all of which render a sphere with different radius.Now I want to render all of them into a object,so that I can apply a filter for all of them.
Suppose my files' name are f1.sd<http://f1.sd>,f2.sd<http://f2.sd>,...,f10.sd<http://f10.sd>,paraview will combine them as one f..sd.If I unfold f..sd and choose all of the files,paraview will render ten objects showed on the Pipeline Browser.I can only apply a filter for just one of the objects.If I don't unfold f..sd but choose it,paraview will only render the first file,f1.sd<http://f1.sd>.
This is my real problem.


2013/9/17 Moreland, Kenneth <kmorel at sandia.gov<mailto:kmorel at sandia.gov>>
The convention for making a reader that accepts multiple files is to first implement a pair of methods in the reader to add file names one at a time and another method to reset the list of file names. Here is some example declarations that would be in the reader's header file.

  // Description:
  // Adds names of files to be read. The files are read in the order
  // they are added.
  virtual void AddFileName(const char* fname);

  // Description:
  // Remove all file names.
  virtual void RemoveAllFileNames();

Then in your reader xml file of the SourceProxy declare a StringVectorProperty with a FileListDomain. Here is an example of that.

      <StringVectorProperty animateable="0"
                            clean_command="RemoveAllFileNames"
                            command="AddFileName"
                            name="FileNames"
                            number_of_elements="0"
                            panel_visibility="never"
                            repeat_command="1">
        <FileListDomain name="files" />
        <Documentation>The list of files to be read by the
        reader.</Documentation>
      </StringVectorProperty>

and have two macro:

 vtkGetStringMacro(FileName);
But paraview can choose multiple files once.And I would like to get the filenames.So what should I do?Can someone give me a simple example?

The voxels in the MRI were not isotropic.  The top row of the image shows 
the head, the proportions
of which appear correct, as well as some of the Data Arrays information. 
Note vtkVolumeSpacing
0.9375, 2   - this matches the MRI acquisition.

Using ParaView 4.0.1 (version included in graphic) I save data as NifTI. I 
then loaded the NifTI, and
as you can see, colored pink on second row, it is compressed along one 
axis.  Note vtkVolumeSpacing
1, 1 - I think this could be source of error.

I also attempted to save to Analyze format with similar result.

I'd appreciate any help/feedback,

Many thanks,
-Timothy

If I open paraview 4.0.1 and then I select python shell, it opens, but I get the following error:


Python 2.6.7 (r267:88850, Oct 11 2012, 20:15:00)

[GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple Clang 4.0 (tags/Apple/clang-418.0.60)] on darwin

from paraview.simple import *

Error: Cannot import vtkPVServerManagerApplicationPython

paraview version 4.0.1


I thought that I would try to manually import, so in the shell I tried and then I got this:

>>> from vtkPVServerManagerApplicationPython import *

Traceback (most recent call last):

File "<console>", line 1, in <module>

ImportError: dlopen(/Applications/paraview.app/Contents/Libraries/vtkPVServerManagerApplicationPython.so, 2): Symbol not found: __ZNSt8ios_base4InitD1Ev

Referenced from: /Applications/paraview.app/Contents/MacOS/../Libraries/libvtkPVServerManagerApplicationPython26D-pv4.0.1.dylib

Expected in: /Applications/paraview.app/Contents/MacOS/../Libraries/libvtkFiltersModelingPython26D-pv4.0.1.dylib


>>>


So, it looks to me like a compile error in one of the internal shared libraries in 4.0.1.

I only know the scalars of some sampling points on the surface and inside

the sphere,I can get a plane with smooth color.What is the prefered way to
do this?

Timothy,

If you try saving out a vti file, is everything working correctly?
Seems to me the Nifti/Analyze writers are not respecting the spacing
that vtkImageData is providing. I wonder if the writer was hard coded
to use the meta-data provided by Nifti/Analyze readers to determine
the spacing and hence could work if you opened and good Nifti file and
then saved it out.

Hi Utkarsh,

Like you I suspect the NifTI/Analyze writers are not capturing the vtkImageData.

I will do the tests you suggest, and let you know results.

This is related to the broken install rules in ParaView "master" for
Python. Once the dashboards clears, we'll do a gatekeeper review and
we'd have the fixes in master.

Utkarsh,

On my linux system using next fixes that problem in a parview build
directory.

When running from a paraview install directory the problem remains.

I don't think there is any filter to automatically convert between spherical and Cartesian (although perhaps there should be). I usually just use the calculator filter. Turn on the Coordinate Results option (it is advanced) and use the following expression:

coordsZ*(cos(0.01745*coordsX)*cos(0.01745*coordsY)*iHat + sin(0.01745*coordsX)*cos(0.01745*coordsY)*jHat + sin(0.01745*coordsY)*kHat)

If your coordinates are lon,lat,elevation and in degrees, then this should give you the right result.

So, i`ve been trying this days, and it`s really difficult...

Do you know, or have a link for a thread about the conversion Cartesian to Spherical coordinates

Maybe it will work, or give at least a poor curvature, that is better than none


2013/9/17 Moreland, Kenneth <kmorel at sandia.gov<mailto:kmorel at sandia.gov>>
In that case, just divide z by something less than 1000.

By arbitrary calculation, I meant you can type in whatever math expression you want to compute the x,y,z location.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] Re: [Paraview] Points Movements - Kilometrical extension x metrical movement

I am using the degrees without any type of conversion, and dividing z by 1000

so it's like

-50? -16? 2700(data that i have) ---> -50;-16;2.7;(data that i create with a routine in java to take out the ? and put the ; and divide z by 1000) ----> table to points ------>  then i have

x    y   z
-50 -16 2.7
... ... ...
... ... ...

7000 points like that create the shore, exactly the way i wanted

I did not have to do spherical lat-lon, to cartesian x-y, it worked without that step


"you can use the calculator filter to apply an arbitrary calculation of the point positions. Turn on the advanced properties and enable the Coordinate Results option."

what do you mean with arbitrary calculation of the points?

How are you converting from spherical lat-lon-elevation to Cartesian x-y-z? I would look to see if you could scale and bias the elevation during that conversion.

If all else fails, you can use the calculator filter to apply an arbitrary calculation of the point positions. Turn on the advanced properties and enable the Coordinate Results option.

You do understand my problem.

How do i stretch the geometry radially? With a small quantity of data?

Thanks for your help!

(Posting this back to the mailing list. I didn't realize we left it.)

Once again assuming I understand your problem (and I'm not sure I totally do), you have a large surface area of land that is much much larger than any change in surface elevation. Thus, you cannot see the change in depth and everything looks like it is a plane (or slightly curved surface depending on how you transform it).

This is a pretty common problem in visualizing ocean, atmosphere, and similar geographical topics. The distance from the deepest ocean trenches to the peak of the tallest mountains is tiny compared to the area of the surface. To see anything of interest, you will probably have to stretch the geometry radially.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] Re: [Paraview] Points Movements - Kilometrical extension x metrical movement

 I guess the physical [x,y,z] coordinates of the shore geometry should be interpreted as [latitude (degrees), longitude (degrees), elevation (kilometers)]. I suppose the trajectory positions would be stored as [latitude (degrees), longitude (degrees), elevation (meters)]. If that is the case, just do a transform with scale values of [1,1,1000].


THAT'S 100% CORRECT. I already did that 1,1,1000 when i transform the data from .dat to .txt

It`s everything in the place where it should be.

The thing now, is that the shore extension go to -30 to -16 degrees ( a lot of kilometers, i heard that 1 degree its like 110 km)

The trajectories while under the earth level have a side dislocation too small compared to the extension of the shore, because of that i can only see a line going up, not moving right/left.

I think the paraview precision is causing it so i dont think(maybe i can, but dont know how, thats why i am asking) i can do too much with paraview

but in the other hand, i can do something with the data, so it will at least give me an idea of an curvature

in one of my tries i rescale all the data by 1000, ^2, but i just get the same thing with diferent numbers




i am ploting points over time(lot of  ****1.csv, ****2.csv,.....)






2013/9/16 Moreland, Kenneth <kmorel at sandia.gov<mailto:kmorel at sandia.gov>>
I guess I don't really understand your problem. Latitude and longitude are of course in degrees or some other angular measurement, not meters or kilometers. Presumably the latitude and longitude have the same units for the shore and the trajectories or you would have said something about that.

So I'm going to start guessing to fill in the details. I guess the physical [x,y,z] coordinates of the shore geometry should be interpreted as [latitude (degrees), longitude (degrees), elevation (kilometers)]. I suppose the trajectory positions would be stored as [latitude (degrees), longitude (degrees), elevation (meters)]. If that is the case, just do a transform with scale values of [1,1,1000].

Or maybe there is more to it than that. You mentioned something about dislocations. Perhaps you mean displacements, but displacements of what? Or maybe the trajectories/displacements are in Cartesian coordinates instead of lat-lon spherical coordinates. In that case, you must be doing something to convert between the two, which I would think rescaling from meters to kilometers could happen then.

Anyway, without more information I don't think I can help.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] Re: [Paraview] Points Movements - Kilometrical extension x metrical movement

It`s not that simple

The position is given by Latitude(x) and Longitude(y)
If i just scale the values, i have to do in both fields, and then i just get the same representation with bigger values
I think it will only be possible to see something that look like a curvature if  i do something mathematicly with the distance between consecutive points, but i dont know waht to do



2013/9/16 Moreland, Kenneth <kmorel at sandia.gov<mailto:kmorel at sandia.gov>>
You can use the calculator filter to scale the values in a field. You can also use the transform filter to scale the physical positions.

Hi

I have  a represented bathymetry of  a shore, and inside of it there's fluid trajectories.

The problem is, the bathymetry have a extension of kilometers and the trajectories side deslocations happens in meters, so its like a straight up line, i cant see the curvatures

Can someone give a tip of how can i interpolate the data so i can see curvatures, or a way to rescale my lateral axis or something like that, like the precision of the data or the precision of paraview

Message-ID: <CAPLvNnpoW3nbrOA8eyqKUVBxwuytuGqzx9WW7WO1oZqydPvOew@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I have a huge h5 file which contains object information based on serial
time. I want to show it on PV as an animation.
The h5 file contains serial groups with time stamp. The issue now is I do
not want to repeat the similar Grid one by one in XDMF, that would be a too
large file and looks so stupid. I'd like to loop the grid to read the h5
data one by one.
Any one has some suggestions?

Thanks in advance

This is still a problem when paraview is installed.  But, pvpython works
correctly from the build directory...

with:

    from vtkParaViewWebCorePython import vtkPVWebInteractionEvent
ImportError: cannot import name vtkPVWebInteractionEvent

Did you start from a clean build as most of the classes have moved to VTK
and changed their names?

I just rebuilt from clean and the pvpython issue is resolved. But, now I
don't have pipeline_manager.py anywhere.  Has this changed?

Thanks,
Paul

Subject: [Paraview] Embedding Paraview in a PYQT based application
Message-ID: <CAJQDoYQo6C4D_eUFt6t6w+RFn4OQZExJC9hRLmVD0YEmYhWPiQ@mail.gmail.com>

I know that someone has asked a similar question almost a year ago (
http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2012-November/026749.html) , but
I was hoping there may have been progress since then. I am building a GUI
using PyQT and I would like to be able to embed a Paraview window within a
QT widget within the GUI that can visualize a Tecplot file that I have. Any
help on this would be greatly appreciated. If it can't be embedded does
anyone know how to make it so that a user can simply press a button and
have Paraview open, and open the file? Thank you!

Stephanie

Looks like this module didn't make the transition from ParaView/Web/Python
to VTK/Web/Python.
Sebastien, should it go into ParaView/Wrapping/Python now?

First question: pipeline_manager.py has been moved/renamed to
paraview/web/pv_web_visualizer.py

Second issue: This might be related to some python libraries (.so)
not being placed in the correct directory. If you copy the *Python.so in
the same directory of the other so files, you should be good.

I have libvtkWebCorePython27D-pv4.0.so in Paraview/lib/paraview-4.0 along
with many others.  And, I get this when running on the installed version:

~/dev/ParaView$ ./bin/pvpython
lib/paraview-4.0/site-packages/paraview/web/pv_web_visualizer.py --content
www --port 8080 --data-dir /home/paul/dev/ParaViewData-v4.0.1/Data
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "lib/paraview-4.0/site-packages/paraview/web/pv_web_visualizer.py",
line 46, in <module>
    from paraview.web import wamp      as pv_wamp
  File
"/home/paul/dev/ParaView/lib/paraview-4.0/site-packages/paraview/web/wamp.py",
line 5, in <module>
    from vtk.web import wamp
  File
"/home/paul/dev/ParaView/lib/paraview-4.0/site-packages/vtk/web/wamp.py",
line 23, in <module>
    from vtkWebCorePython import vtkWebApplication
ImportError: No module named vtkWebCorePython

But this does work in the ParaView build directory

Subject: [Paraview] How to indicate cell normals.
Message-ID: <501100.24543.qm@web100910.mail.kks.yahoo.co.jp>

Hi! All

I use ls-dyna and I open d3plot file in paraview.
I want to indicate cell normals.
So, I try to apply the generate surface normals.
However, I can't apply it.

Please tell me how to indicate cell normals vectors and contour in paraview.

Thank you
Yusuke

Hi Yusuke,

Your ls-dyna dataset probably has volumetric cells instead of a surface mesh. Run the Extract Surface filter on your data first and then try generating normals.

Hi! David!
Thank you for your help.

I am able to get to point data of Normals.
But if I select Normals, it is not displayed in paraview.( it means that 
behavior of the normal is not observed in paraview)
I analyze the axial symmetry model.
I use Extract Surface filter and generate surface normal filter.
Should  I use other filter??

Thank you 
Best regards
Yusuke

If you want normal glyphs (arrows drawn at points showing the direction of the normals), then you should use the Glyph filter after Generate Surface Normals.

There are several ways to create a mesh filling a solid cube in ParaView. I think the easiest is to use the Wavelet source. After you create it, change the representation from Outline to Surface to render it as a solid.

In-Reply-To: <CAE=GJrb9uSOtU8Gg-KvqKozRxN3XORX7pDq07v2zLZ1aA_CCyQ@mail.gmail.com>
Message-ID: <CE65B6EB.1097A%kmorel@sandia.gov>

It looks like the elevation in your data has a strange bias (at least, strange in terms of spherical coordinates). I am guessing that the elevation in your data is with respect to sea level whereas the expression I gave you assumed elevation was with respect to the center of the sphere.

I think you can correct the problem by adding back a bias to the elevation in the calculator expression I gave you. Change the coordsZ at the beginning to (coordsZ+10) or (coordsZ+100). So in review, try this equation:

(coordsZ+100)*(cos(0.01745*coordsX)*cos(0.01745*coordsY)*iHat + sin(0.01745*coordsX)*cos(0.01745*coordsY)*jHat + sin(0.01745*coordsY)*kHat)

Assuming I'm right about the sea-level bias, you could bias it by the radius of the earth, but that would probably just look like a flat surface.

I don't think there is any filter to automatically convert between spherical and Cartesian (although perhaps there should be). I usually just use the calculator filter. Turn on the Coordinate Results option (it is advanced) and use the following expression:

coordsZ*(cos(0.01745*coordsX)*cos(0.01745*coordsY)*iHat + sin(0.01745*coordsX)*cos(0.01745*coordsY)*jHat + sin(0.01745*coordsY)*kHat)

If your coordinates are lon,lat,elevation and in degrees, then this should give you the right result.

So, i`ve been trying this days, and it`s really difficult...

Do you know, or have a link for a thread about the conversion Cartesian to Spherical coordinates

Maybe it will work, or give at least a poor curvature, that is better than none


2013/9/17 Moreland, Kenneth <kmorel at sandia.gov<mailto:kmorel at sandia.gov>>
In that case, just divide z by something less than 1000.

By arbitrary calculation, I meant you can type in whatever math expression you want to compute the x,y,z location.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] Re: [Paraview] Points Movements - Kilometrical extension x metrical movement

I am using the degrees without any type of conversion, and dividing z by 1000

so it's like

-50? -16? 2700(data that i have) ---> -50;-16;2.7;(data that i create with a routine in java to take out the ? and put the ; and divide z by 1000) ----> table to points ------>  then i have

x    y   z
-50 -16 2.7
... ... ...
... ... ...

7000 points like that create the shore, exactly the way i wanted

I did not have to do spherical lat-lon, to cartesian x-y, it worked without that step


"you can use the calculator filter to apply an arbitrary calculation of the point positions. Turn on the advanced properties and enable the Coordinate Results option."

what do you mean with arbitrary calculation of the points?















2013/9/17 Moreland, Kenneth <kmorel at sandia.gov<mailto:kmorel at sandia.gov>>
How are you converting from spherical lat-lon-elevation to Cartesian x-y-z? I would look to see if you could scale and bias the elevation during that conversion.

If all else fails, you can use the calculator filter to apply an arbitrary calculation of the point positions. Turn on the advanced properties and enable the Coordinate Results option.

You do understand my problem.

How do i stretch the geometry radially? With a small quantity of data?

Thanks for your help!


2013/9/16 Moreland, Kenneth <kmorel at sandia.gov<mailto:kmorel at sandia.gov>>
(Posting this back to the mailing list. I didn't realize we left it.)

Once again assuming I understand your problem (and I'm not sure I totally do), you have a large surface area of land that is much much larger than any change in surface elevation. Thus, you cannot see the change in depth and everything looks like it is a plane (or slightly curved surface depending on how you transform it).

This is a pretty common problem in visualizing ocean, atmosphere, and similar geographical topics. The distance from the deepest ocean trenches to the peak of the tallest mountains is tiny compared to the area of the surface. To see anything of interest, you will probably have to stretch the geometry radially.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] Re: [Paraview] Points Movements - Kilometrical extension x metrical movement

 I guess the physical [x,y,z] coordinates of the shore geometry should be interpreted as [latitude (degrees), longitude (degrees), elevation (kilometers)]. I suppose the trajectory positions would be stored as [latitude (degrees), longitude (degrees), elevation (meters)]. If that is the case, just do a transform with scale values of [1,1,1000].


THAT'S 100% CORRECT. I already did that 1,1,1000 when i transform the data from .dat to .txt

It`s everything in the place where it should be.

The thing now, is that the shore extension go to -30 to -16 degrees ( a lot of kilometers, i heard that 1 degree its like 110 km)

The trajectories while under the earth level have a side dislocation too small compared to the extension of the shore, because of that i can only see a line going up, not moving right/left.

I think the paraview precision is causing it so i dont think(maybe i can, but dont know how, thats why i am asking) i can do too much with paraview

but in the other hand, i can do something with the data, so it will at least give me an idea of an curvature

in one of my tries i rescale all the data by 1000, ^2, but i just get the same thing with diferent numbers




i am ploting points over time(lot of  ****1.csv, ****2.csv,.....)






2013/9/16 Moreland, Kenneth <kmorel at sandia.gov<mailto:kmorel at sandia.gov>>
I guess I don't really understand your problem. Latitude and longitude are of course in degrees or some other angular measurement, not meters or kilometers. Presumably the latitude and longitude have the same units for the shore and the trajectories or you would have said something about that.

So I'm going to start guessing to fill in the details. I guess the physical [x,y,z] coordinates of the shore geometry should be interpreted as [latitude (degrees), longitude (degrees), elevation (kilometers)]. I suppose the trajectory positions would be stored as [latitude (degrees), longitude (degrees), elevation (meters)]. If that is the case, just do a transform with scale values of [1,1,1000].

Or maybe there is more to it than that. You mentioned something about dislocations. Perhaps you mean displacements, but displacements of what? Or maybe the trajectories/displacements are in Cartesian coordinates instead of lat-lon spherical coordinates. In that case, you must be doing something to convert between the two, which I would think rescaling from meters to kilometers could happen then.

Anyway, without more information I don't think I can help.

It`s not that simple

The position is given by Latitude(x) and Longitude(y)
If i just scale the values, i have to do in both fields, and then i just get the same representation with bigger values
I think it will only be possible to see something that look like a curvature if  i do something mathematicly with the distance between consecutive points, but i dont know waht to do



2013/9/16 Moreland, Kenneth <kmorel at sandia.gov<mailto:kmorel at sandia.gov>>
You can use the calculator filter to scale the values in a field. You can also use the transform filter to scale the physical positions.

Hi

I have  a represented bathymetry of  a shore, and inside of it there's fluid trajectories.

The problem is, the bathymetry have a extension of kilometers and the trajectories side deslocations happens in meters, so its like a straight up line, i cant see the curvatures

Can someone give a tip of how can i interpolate the data so i can see curvatures, or a way to rescale my lateral axis or something like that, like the precision of the data or the precision of paraview

Subject: [Paraview] outline source in pvbatch
Message-ID: <D90F54CD-AD1C-4AC6-9359-6195F36A4EF1@anl.gov>

Hi,

I'm having trouble using pvbatch with a python state script that contains an Outline source.   The full script is below, but in brief, I started paraview, added an Outline source, using the default settings, and then saved state as a .py file.  When I try to run pvbatch with this state file I get the following error about missing Attribute Bounds.  Am I perhaps missing an extra import, or something?  Any advice on how to solve this would be appreciated.

I ultimately want to animate over a series of time steps, calling Outline.SetBounds() to update the position of the outline object.  Calling SetBounds() in this script yields similar results.  I'm hoping that there is a simple fix that will apply to both errors.

Thanks,
joe

Hi all,

I am using paraview to generate figures of a distorted mesh. I am  
using a wireframe representation. Are there options available to  
improve the resolution of the wireframe representation to eliminate  
the offset lines as shown in the attached figure?

Hi! 

I add Glyph filter but animation don't move ( But time moves normally)
If I select point data of acceleration, the animation moves and I can 
observe it.

Should I use more filters??

Best regards
Yusuke

Sorry! I mistake! I can indicate the cell normals!

Thank you!

Subject: [Paraview] How to indicate the pressure data in paraview ( I use
	LS-DYNA)
Message-ID: <340485.43466.qm@web100905.mail.kks.yahoo.co.jp>

Hi! All!?
I'm sorry to ask a lot of questions.

I use LS-DYNA and I input d3plot file to paraview.
If I use ls-prepost, I can indicate pressure but there is not pressure data in paraview.
So, I can't indicate pressure ?in paraview.

Should I use some filters???

Thank you a lot.?
Best regards
Yusuke

(Please keep on the list.)

Try running the data through the Delaunay 3D filter. No need to subclass anything.

There are several ways to create a mesh filling a solid cube in ParaView. I think the easiest is to use the Wavelet source. After you create it, change the representation from Outline to Surface to render it as a solid.

The wireframe shows the edges of the mesh so... use a higher resolution mesh. There might be other tricks you could use, like apply a texture to a surface, but that depends on the nature of your data. 

Maybe it would help if it was more clear what you are trying to do. I don't know what you mean by offset lines or really see anything in your image you would want to remove. If you added more lines they would just follow the existing lines until it became too dense to see any of them.

Dear All,

I would like to have a plugin in Paraview that shows the earth, either 
as a spherical or equidistant cylindrical projection, along with its 
texture, orography and bathymetry. And I would like to have this as a 
Source in Paraview, in which I can load different textures, and set 
different scaling levels for the orography.
I've attached an image to show what I'm aiming at ...

The thing is not that difficult to implement, yet I am unsure how to do 
it it as a Paraview plugin. Ideally would be a plugin derived from 
vtkActor, yet this does not seem possible. Therefore, I am asking for 
advice. What would be the best class to derive my plugin from? In the 
end, all I have as output is polygonal data with a texture applied to it.


Thank you all for reading and your help,
Cheers, Niklas

The full script is below, but in brief, I started paraview, added an Outline source, using the default settings, and then saved state as a .py file.

Subject: [Paraview] Building Paraview against Enthought Canopy Python on Mac
	OS 10.8.5
Message-ID: <CAJAZx5BEFE0QjMa0qq3Bzfb38uXUZM_9=SZ96BLQid=kBEEG-A@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Paraview Community,

This is mostly just a description of my experience successfully building
Paraview. However there is one outstanding issue involving RPATH (described
at the end) that I would greatly appreciate some advice on.

I use what is probably an increasingly popular platform for scientific
computing: Mac OS plus the excellent Enthought Canopy python environment.
Canopy greatly simplifies the installation of numpy / scipy and related
packages and is free for academic use. Canopy creates a standalone python
installation on Mac OS, completely replacing the system python.

The problem is that the paraview binary distribution for Mac OS links
against the standard system python, meaning that I cannot load scipy
modules from within the paraview python shell, or in pvpython. To fix this,
I decided to build a new paraview from source linking against the Canopy
python.

For the most part, the build was very straightforward following the wiki
instructions http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView:Build_And_Install
I installed cmake 2.8.8 from source and QT 4.8.5 from the dmg (
http://qt-project.org/downloads)
I did not install ffmpeg or mesa.
Then I downloaded the Paraview v4.0.1 source. FYI, my Canopy version is
1.1.0 64-bit.

I had to use several custom settings in ccmake. Of course,
PARAVIEW_ENABLE_PYTHON = On
I had to point ccmake at the canopy python enviroment. This took some
figuring out. With canopy, your python executable is
$HOME/Library/Enthought/Canopy_64bit/User/bin/python
Naturally I thought to use the following settings
PYTHON_EXECUTABLE=$HOME/Library/Enthought/Canopy_64bit/User/bin/python
PYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR=$HOME/Library/Enthought/Canopy_64bit/User/include
PYTHON_LIBRARY=$HOME/Library/Enthought/Canopy_64bit/User/Python
However, this caused ccmake to give an error, complaining about a missing
patchlevel.h file in the python include directory. I poked around and found
a different version of the includes inside the Canopy app. The settings
that ended up working were
PYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR=/Applications/Canopy.app/appdata/canopy-1.1.0.1371.macosx-x86_64/Canopy.app/Contents/include/python2.7/
PYTHON_LIBRARY=/Applications/Canopy.app/appdata/canopy-1.1.0.1371.macosx-x86_64/Canopy.app/Contents/lib/libpython2.7.dylib
After this ccmake was able to finish successfully. Then I built and
installed (make && make install) with no errors.

The only issue I have now is that paraview binaries link to python using
RPATH. Compare the original paraview binary:
$ otool -L /Applications/paraview_original.app/Contents/bin/pvpython
...
/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/Python
(compatibility version 2.7.0, current version 2.7.1)
...
with my new paraview binary
$ otool -L /Applications/paraview.app/Contents/bin/pvpython
...
@rpath/Python (compatibility version 2.7.0, current version 2.7.0)
...

The problem is that the linker cannot find the python libraries at runtime
using rpath.
$ Applications/paraview.app/Contents/MacOS/paraview
dyld: Library not loaded: @rpath/Python
  Referenced from: /Applications/paraview.app/Contents/MacOS/paraview
  Reason: image not found
Trace/BPT trap: 5

However, if I pass the library path using DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH, it works fine.
$ DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/Users/rpa/Library/Enthought/Canopy_64bit/User
/Applications/paraview.app/Contents/MacOS/paraview

The documentation on ccmake and RPATH is quite overwhelming for a novice
like me. I am content to use my DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH hack, but if anyone knows
how to overcome this issue, my build would be flawless.

In any case, I hope this message will be useful for anyone else interested
in using paraview with a canopy-based python.

Best,
Ryan Abernathey

Your options are probably either to wait or do something else. Delaunay triangulation is a pretty heavyweight operation and in general it is not trivial to impose a topology on a collection of points.

You might rethink whether you really need to create a solid sphere in the first place. I'm guessing you have at least around 100,000 points (or else Delaunay probably would not be that slow). If you just render these points as a cloud of points, you should get enough occlusion for it to look pretty much like a sphere.

I have a lot of points taking sample from a solid sphere.So I want to use Delaunay 3D filter to render the shpere with known scalars of the points.But it took me so much time.What should I do?

Thanks, Utkarsh,

This did solve the problem with creating the Outline source.  Once created, though, I am subsequently having trouble updating it by calling SetBounds().   Do I need to cast Outline1 as an Outline source,  or qualify it some other way?

Thanks for your help,
joe

Joe,
The property name  is "Bounds", not "SetBounds", you just want to do
something like the following instead:

Outline1.Bounds = [0, .75, 0, 0.75, 0, 1]

Ah, right.. I had been looking at the C++ docs.

Thanks again, Utkarsh,

The full script is below, but in brief, I started paraview, added an Outline source, using the default settings, and then saved state as a .py file.  When I try to run pvbatch with this state file I get the following error about missing Attribute Bounds.  Am I perhaps missing an extra import, or something?

Sorry for the confusion. I was not referring to the resolution of the  
mesh itself, but the resolution of the lines in the wireframe. These  
lines appear pixellated, especially when zoomed, which is what I meant  
by offset. Is there a way to improve this? And if so can it also be  
done from a pvpython script?

Thanks

OK, it sounds like you are referring to the aliasing problem with the
rendering of the lines. ParaView is (should be) rendering the lines at one
pixel width and drawing the lines using an integer step interpolation
scheme (for example, Bresenham's algorithm). The problem is that if you
look close, the lines are often jagged when they are not lined up with the
pixels and have to switch a row or column.

When you say zoom, I assume you mean you save the image and then zoom into
the image. If you zoomed into ParaView's 3D view, the lines would continue
to be rendered at the same pixel width, so the jaggedness would not really
get any better or worse (although they might flicker in ways that are more
noticeable).

Usually if I want to get a nice quality image, I'll render something much
bigger than I really want, then use a simple image editor to reduce the
size back down (using a smoothing algorithm). That, from a signal
processing point, is a good way to reduce the aliasing you are seeing.
(BTW, you may want to also increase the width of the lines to make them
more visible in the final image.)

Since we don't support offscreen for screenshots on OsX. There is not need.
The default OpenGL drivers work correctly when capturing screenshots even
with overlapping windows which is the main reason for
offscreen-for-screenshots setting.

Ah, thanks for the explanation.

My user says, and I have not verified, that the screensaver is messing up her movies.  She is on a mac.

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview Programmable Source 3D Text
Message-ID: <5242B6BA.7040306@ipf.tuwien.ac.at>

I'd like to insert various text strings programmatically into the scene
at various 3D locations in world coordinates. To me, (Python)
"Programmable Source" seems to be the appropriate tool for that purpose
(which I successfully use to insert geometries into the scene). Is that
possible using "Programmable Source"? Otherwise, is there any other
method to do so?

I am aware of Sources -> 3D Text,
but that means a lot of manual, repetitive work.

Many thanks!

Willi,

You can still use the programmable source for 3D text. With "vtkPolyData"
as the chosen Output DataSet Type, you can use the attached script as the
"Script".

Subject: [Paraview] recommendations to enable additional VTK modules for

Message-ID: <CAOqyOuELHgqFeiwEtFVqxoF=0hXMvLP2H-V9GHypELoQWjjGdg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I am working on a plugin and would like to enable an additional VTK module
that is not normally built by paraview (specifically vtklibproj4).

To enable this I did four things
1) Enable Module_vtklibproj4 when building paraview

To my plugin CMakeLists I did the following

2) Add vtk_module_load(vtklibproj4)
3) Add include_directories(${vtklibproj4_INCLUDE_DIRS})
4) to target_link_libraries add  ${vtklibproj4_LIBRARIES}

Is this the best way to enable additional VTK modules for plugin
development?

Thank you

Pretty much, esp since libproj is a third party module that isn't wrapped.
For other wrapped vtk modules, enabling the module in ParaView will make it
seem like it's just another ParaView module and you wouldn't need to do the
vtk_module_load(..) etc, althogh, wouldn't hurt if you did.

That is strange. I cannot replicate your problem. I used a point source to create 16020 random points in a sphere, and the Delaunay triangulation took only about 2 seconds. My processor might be a bit better than yours, but not anywhere near enough to explain the difference.

What version of ParaView are you using? Are you a binary downloaded from paraview.org or did you build your own?

Your options are probably either to wait or do something else. Delaunay triangulation is a pretty heavyweight operation and in general it is not trivial to impose a topology on a collection of points.

You might rethink whether you really need to create a solid sphere in the first place. I'm guessing you have at least around 100,000 points (or else Delaunay probably would not be that slow). If you just render these points as a cloud of points, you should get enough occlusion for it to look pretty much like a sphere.

I have a lot of points taking sample from a solid sphere.So I want to use Delaunay 3D filter to render the shpere with known scalars of the points.But it took me so much time.What should I do?

Currently I am using paraview version 3.98.1 on window environment and use ensight gold format for import data.  It seems to me that the paraview doesn't support quadratic elements nor tetrahedral elements.  Is it true? Thanks,

Subject: [Paraview] My own filter as part of pipeline for coprocessing
 raises "name not defined" error
Message-ID: <65F8B323A072504ABFC5D3D8751910514FF7C864@MAIL-MBX1.ad.renci.org>

Hello,

I set up a pipeline that used a custom filter I developed and exported it as a python script for coprocessing. I have made sure the static library for my custom filter is built and available in paraview-build/lib directory, and I have also linked this custom filter static library along with Catalyst libs to the simulation code for coprocessing. However, when I run the simulation linked with ParaView coprocessing for in-situ visualization, I got "NameError: name 'MyCustomizedFilterName' is not defined" error when the line of my customized filter in my python coprocessing script is read in for pipeline coprocessing. What should I do to get my custom filter wrapped in python so that it can be recognized and used as part of the python pipeline script for coprocessing? Any advice and suggestions are very much appreciated.

Thanks,

Hong

Hi Mr. Samuel
Thank you to answer my question!
I found BendingResultant_X,Y,Z , NormalResultant_X,Y,Z , ShearResultant_X,Y.
However I can't find Sigma_XX,XY,XZ.......and Results.
Maybe these are not Sigma and results.
Should I set calculation files to output sigma and results??
But I don't know  how to do ....

Thank you 
Best regards
Yusuke

Did you use a plugin to add in your custom filter when creating the Python
co-processing script? I'm not sure how plugins are "loaded" for static
builds but you may want to look at
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Plugin_HowTo#Plugins_in_Static_Applications.
If that doesn't work, we'll have to figure out some other way to do it.

Dear Utkarsh,

would it be possible to synchronize the transform of the rendered texts
to the transform of the camera, such that the planes in which the texts
lie stay normal to the viewing direction?
I'm aware of vtkFollower, but I'm not sure if it is applicable / how to
make use of it in the context of ParaView / Programmable Source, as it
derives from vtkActor.

Many thanks!
Willi.

Subject: [Paraview] Export image without background
Message-ID: <52441210.5020401@gmail.com>

Dear all,
is there a way to export an image without the background?
For example, in the attached svg file I would like to export only the 
contour map
and not the map+background. Is that possible?
With best regards.

Hi Roberto,

To remove the background, uncheck the "Draw background" and "Rasterize 3D
geometry" checkboxes in the Export Options dialog that appears after
setting the filename.

Subject: [Paraview] How to indicate the pressure data in paraview ( I
 use LS-DYNA)
In-Reply-To: <loom.20130926T032833-161@post.gmane.org>

Message-ID: <52444AC5.8090706@bresnan.net>

Yusuke-san,

I am very sorry; I am not a LS-Dyna user and therefore not so familiar 
with how one directs LS-Dyna to write the stress component array 
[Sigma_ij] to the d3plot-file.

[Sigma_ij] is the 3x3 symmetric array

| Sigma_xx Sigma_xy Sigma_xz |
| Sigma_xy Sigma_yy Sigma_yz |
| Sigma_xz Sigma_yz Sigma_zz |



You noted that "resultant" components were in the d3plot-file. This 
suggests to me at least two possibilities:

Case(1). Your model is using 3D solid finite elements that are 
internally configured to behave as shell elements (the word "resultant" 
is commonly used to describe the stress components in shell 
formulations), or

Case(2). Your model is using 3D solid finite elements that use a 
multiple-point volume integration rule and, therefore, has multiple 
stress-strain evaluations within each element. Post-processors like 
ParaView typically use only a single set of stress components per 
element and, thus, some form of volume averaging is required to provide 
a set of 'mean' stress values.

Be aware that "Resultant" can have different definitions in Case(1) and 
Case(2). Only someone very familiar with LS-Dyna can tell you what is 
done internally in LS-Dyna to get these values.

You may be able to see in ParaView a single interior pressure value by 
doing the following replacement:

Sigma_XX ==> NormalResultant_X

Sigma_YY ==> NormalResultant_Y

Sigma_ZZ ==> NormalResultant_Z

In either Case(1) or Case(2) above, you will be examining an average 
pressure in each element, however, this pressure will not be at the 
surface of the finite element.

To get surface pressure values, the components listed as 
"BendingResultant_X,Y,Z" must be combined with "NormalResultant_X,Y,Z" 
values in a very particular way. Please find a colleague that 
understands shell formulations to explain the process.

Best regards,

Sam Key

I think that information is out of date. I believe that is done
automatically now.

Otherwise Andy is right. Putting the filter inside a plugin a good way to
go. The plugin infrastructure will make it so that when you provide the XML
that describes your vtk class, ParaView's build system will automatically
wrap it into a proxy and python class so that ParaView will be able to use
it.

Also, I recommend trying it on a local static build first. That way the
build time will be less and development will be quicker. Once you can load
you plugin locally, then you should only have to compile on titan once.

I doubt that would make a difference. I just tried a bimodal distribution using two point sources, and the filter still executed in about the same amount of time.

So what version of ParaView are you using? Are you using a binary downloaded from paraview.org or did you build your own?

My points are not Uniform distribution.They take from intersections of 89 wefts and 180 warps.So the points are intensive at poles and sparse at equator.Is this the problem?

That is strange. I cannot replicate your problem. I used a point source to create 16020 random points in a sphere, and the Delaunay triangulation took only about 2 seconds. My processor might be a bit better than yours, but not anywhere near enough to explain the difference.

in fact,I have only 16020 points for test.My cpu is AMD Athlon(tm) II P320 Dual-Core Processor with 2.1GHz.How long will it take in this case if I use one cpu to calculate?I have wait for more than 10 minutes before stopping it.


2013/9/24 Moreland, Kenneth <kmorel at sandia.gov<mailto:kmorel at sandia.gov>>
Your options are probably either to wait or do something else. Delaunay triangulation is a pretty heavyweight operation and in general it is not trivial to impose a topology on a collection of points.

You might rethink whether you really need to create a solid sphere in the first place. I'm guessing you have at least around 100,000 points (or else Delaunay probably would not be that slow). If you just render these points as a cloud of points, you should get enough occlusion for it to look pretty much like a sphere.

I have a lot of points taking sample from a solid sphere.So I want to use Delaunay 3D filter to render the shpere with known scalars of the points.But it took me so much time.What should I do?

http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Plugin_HowTo#Plugins_in_Static_Applications
when the plugin is external to ParaView. If you put your plugin inside
ParaView/Plugins, then it is done automatically.

Alas, that's not easy to do, if at all possible, with Python source.

ParaView supports both. See http://www.vtk.org/VTK/img/file-formats.pdf

The file format that you are using may not support it however.

Thanks! I did put my plugin inside ParaView/Plugins in the same way as other Plugins, and enabled it when building ParaView superbuild on Titan. I can see the static lib for the Plugin is built in paraview-build/lib directory. And yes, I did use a plugin and load it via Tools|Manage Plugins when creating python coprocessing script. However, it looks like my plugin is not loaded automatically even though it is built by ParaView superbuild. Perhaps I should still follow the link http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Plugin_HowTo#Plugins_in_Static_Applications but I am having some difficulty in following the info in the link to do what is suggested. Specifically, to what file should I insert two macros? It does not sound right to insert them into my custom plugin cxx file. Where should I add two macros to get my custom filter plugin to be loaded and wrapper into python module? I see "LoadPlugin" function defined in simple.py to call servermanager.LoadPlugin(filename, remote) which I am thinking perhaps should be called to load my plugin before my python coprocessing script is executed, but not sure whether this is the case or not.

Thanks for any suggestions!

Utkarsh pointed out that you still need to follow http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Plugin_HowTo#Plugins_in_Static_Applications
when the plugin is external to ParaView. If you put your plugin inside ParaView/Plugins, then it is done automatically.

I think that information is out of date. I believe that is done automatically now.

Otherwise Andy is right. Putting the filter inside a plugin a good way to go. The plugin infrastructure will make it so that when you provide the XML that describes your vtk class, ParaView's build system will automatically wrap it into a proxy and python class so that ParaView will be able to use it.

Also, I recommend trying it on a local static build first. That way the build time will be less and development will be quicker. Once you can load you plugin locally, then you should only have to compile on titan once.

Hello,

I set up a pipeline that used a custom filter I developed and exported it as a python script for coprocessing. I have made sure the static library for my custom filter is built and available in paraview-build/lib directory, and I have also linked this custom filter static library along with Catalyst libs to the simulation code for coprocessing. However, when I run the simulation linked with ParaView coprocessing for in-situ visualization, I got "NameError: name 'MyCustomizedFilterName' is not defined" error when the line of my customized filter in my python coprocessing script is read in for pipeline coprocessing. What should I do to get my custom filter wrapped in python so that it can be recognized and used as part of the python pipeline script for coprocessing? Any advice and suggestions are very much appreciated.

Thanks,

Hong

Is this data you can share with the list?

If so one of us may have a suggestion. Without knowing any of the specifics
my only suggestion is to use a python programmable source and in that
manually code up the parsing and vtkdataset generation.

I doubt that would make a difference. I just tried a bimodal distribution using two point sources, and the filter still executed in about the same amount of time.

Your options are probably either to wait or do something else. Delaunay triangulation is a pretty heavyweight operation and in general it is not trivial to impose a topology on a collection of points.

You might rethink whether you really need to create a solid sphere in the first place. I'm guessing you have at least around 100,000 points (or else Delaunay probably would not be that slow). If you just render these points as a cloud of points, you should get enough occlusion for it to look pretty much like a sphere.

Subject: [Paraview] GPU acceleration on Paraview
Message-ID: <b53ee6a80da1482dac0360736c04cc5e@AMSPR01MB167.eurprd01.prod.exchangelabs.com>

Hello,

I am very much a novice when using paraview. I am doing some plasma turbulence simulations and have been trying to volume render my data cube (about 5GB size). On linux it took ages, slowed down my graphics, and then finally crashed my system but on windows the rendering happened very fast (5 minutes) but I could not visualize properly (zoom in/zoom out) afterwards -- paraview stalled incredibly. I couldn't do anything after this. I have a pretty good workstation with 2 six core Xeon processors (24 threads in total), with 192 GB ram and two NVIDIA cards (a Tesla K20c with 5GB ram and around 2500 cores, and a NVIDIA Quadro 2000 card for the visualisation).  Could you please tell me what I can do to improve the rending time and solve the problem of post-rendering visualisation. In particular I think it was only using 4 of the cpu-cores. I have heard on many forums that GPU hardware acceleration can significantly speed things up -- especially with my Tesla. I have the Quadro and Tesla cards running in a NVIDIA maximus configuration with the Quadro on dedicated graphics and the Tesla on dedicated compute.

Your help is much appreciated.

With many thanks and kind regards,

Khurom

Can you share your plugin or at least the CMakeLists.txt for your plugin?
Have you tried with any other plugins that get packaged with ParaView to
see if they work?

If you're using Catalyst, I would suggest adding in the
PV_PLUGIN_IMPORT_INIT macros to the adaptor.

???,

I found some spare time to look into this.

The test data set you provided defines a point cloud with spherical
topology. Your reader does import this geometric information (as
points), but provides no topology. In order for VTK and hence ParaView
to display anything, some kind of topology is needed. The simplest being
vertices as 0D topology, i.e. a dot per point. The patch attached does
exactly add that. With this, you can already see something in ParaView
when using your reader plugin to import the test data set.

You've been trying to triangulate your point cloud with spherical
topology with Delaunay3D, in vain. I could reproduce that. With a debug
build of ParaView, one notices thousands of warnings of kind "Unable to
factor linear system" being issued when trying to apply Delaunay3D
filter to your input.

The same actually happens when applying Delaunay3D filter to a sphere
source created with theta resolution 180 and phi resolution 90.
A few dozen warnings about being unable to factor a linear system are
raised. (On a side node: a debug build of ParaView master branch with
CMake option VTK_DEBUG_LEAKS:BOOL=ON reveals a memory leak in Delaunay3D
when applied to this densely meshed sphere.) The result, however, is
disappointing as the volume mesh has some gaps and rifts, not really a
smooth surface any more. So, you need to pursue another triangulation
approach.

Applying Delaunay2D filter instead produces at least a hemisphere,
almost instantly. I suspect, however, that a hemisphere is not good
enough.

You could resort to applying a Glyph filter with Glyph type "Sphere" and
otherwise default settings. That yields a coarse approximation of what I
guess you would like to achieve.

It might also be that class vtkSurfaceReconstructionFilter or class
vtkMarchingCubes or one of the filters from the pv-meshless plugin are
able to create the surface mesh, but I'm not too familiar with them to
say this with confidence or provide additional advice.

There have recently even been a few discussions on the VTK mailing list
regarding the general problem of triangulating point clouds with
spherical topology, see e.g.
http://markmail.org/message/fc3kjifkwtpggqai

But given that your points are not arbitrarily distributed over the
sphere, but in fact stored in your input file in a very regular and pre-
sorted way (180 points per latitude, latitude after latitude from pole
to pole) and given that the implied topology is very simple too (every
vertex has exactly 4 neighbors), it is not too hard to extend your
reader to have it create a smooth triangulation of the surface by simple
quads (connecting vertex i with i+1, i+181 and i+180) without involving
the help from additional VTK meshing classes.

Maybe someone else on the list can even tell you how to re-arrange your
data to fulfill the prerequisites for a structured grid data set for
which the triangulation is implicitly done by VTK.

Hope this helps,
Karl

I have an extra question.Both my reader and Delaunay3D filter are subclass
from vtkUnstructuredGridAlgorithm.But when I test with 8 vertices of a
cube,my reader renders a hollow cube.But why can Delaunay3D filter render a
solid cube?I have checked the Delaunay3D source file,but can not find the
answer.

First, I am assuming that you are creating an unstructured data set with a hexahedron connecting those 8 vertices.

The default rendering mode is surface. You should see that word in the representation choosers in the middle toolbar. For opaque renderings, it looks the same. Change the representation to volume to see a transparent volume.

Have you gone through the ParaView tutorial? Representations and many other topics are discussed there.

???,

I found some spare time to look into this.

The test data set you provided defines a point cloud with spherical
topology. Your reader does import this geometric information (as
points), but provides no topology. In order for VTK and hence ParaView
to display anything, some kind of topology is needed. The simplest being
vertices as 0D topology, i.e. a dot per point. The patch attached does
exactly add that. With this, you can already see something in ParaView
when using your reader plugin to import the test data set.

You've been trying to triangulate your point cloud with spherical
topology with Delaunay3D, in vain. I could reproduce that. With a debug
build of ParaView, one notices thousands of warnings of kind "Unable to
factor linear system" being issued when trying to apply Delaunay3D
filter to your input.

The same actually happens when applying Delaunay3D filter to a sphere
source created with theta resolution 180 and phi resolution 90.
A few dozen warnings about being unable to factor a linear system are
raised. (On a side node: a debug build of ParaView master branch with
CMake option VTK_DEBUG_LEAKS:BOOL=ON reveals a memory leak in Delaunay3D
when applied to this densely meshed sphere.) The result, however, is
disappointing as the volume mesh has some gaps and rifts, not really a
smooth surface any more. So, you need to pursue another triangulation
approach.

Applying Delaunay2D filter instead produces at least a hemisphere,
almost instantly. I suspect, however, that a hemisphere is not good
enough.

You could resort to applying a Glyph filter with Glyph type "Sphere" and
otherwise default settings. That yields a coarse approximation of what I
guess you would like to achieve.

It might also be that class vtkSurfaceReconstructionFilter or class
vtkMarchingCubes or one of the filters from the pv-meshless plugin are
able to create the surface mesh, but I'm not too familiar with them to
say this with confidence or provide additional advice.

There have recently even been a few discussions on the VTK mailing list
regarding the general problem of triangulating point clouds with
spherical topology, see e.g.
http://markmail.org/message/fc3kjifkwtpggqai

But given that your points are not arbitrarily distributed over the
sphere, but in fact stored in your input file in a very regular and pre-
sorted way (180 points per latitude, latitude after latitude from pole
to pole) and given that the implied topology is very simple too (every
vertex has exactly 4 neighbors), it is not too hard to extend your
reader to have it create a smooth triangulation of the surface by simple
quads (connecting vertex i with i+1, i+181 and i+180) without involving
the help from additional VTK meshing classes.

Maybe someone else on the list can even tell you how to re-arrange your
data to fulfill the prerequisites for a structured grid data set for
which the triangulation is implicitly done by VTK.

Hope this helps,
Karl

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView not building "pvserver"
Message-ID: <5248F059.3040701@indiana.edu>

Hello everyone,

So I've been working on getting ParaView compiled on a new
Cray XE/XK7 system, and I seem to have made some progress,
but not enough to have ParaView running.

So my main problem is that when I do get the make process
to complete, it doesn't produce the "pvserver" executable.
Here's what it does produce:
	% ls bin
	H5detect               vtkmkg3states-pv4.0        vtkWrapHierarchy-pv4.0
	H5make_libsettings     vtkParseJava-pv4.0         vtkWrapJava-pv4.0
	protoc                 vtkParseOGLExt-pv4.0       vtkWrapPythonInit-pv4.0
	smTestDriver           vtkProcessShader-pv4.0     vtkWrapPython-pv4.0
	vtkEncodeString-pv4.0  vtkpython                  vtkWrapTclInit-pv4.0
	vtkHashSource-pv4.0    vtkWrapClientServer-pv4.0  vtkWrapTcl-pv4.0

So there's no "paraview" itself because I turned off the
QT-GUI flag.  As this is an HPC machine, I expect to use
it in server mode.


There is another problem, which I'm not sure whether it's
related or not, and that is that I can't get it to compile
when the PARAVIEW_USE_MPI flag is on.

So I guess my first question is: do I need to have PARAVIEW_USE_MPI
on in order to get "pvserver" built?  In theory, I can choose
to run with only one "pvserver" process, in which case it doesn't
need MPI, but in general of course one would run more than one.
But I think in other circumstances I've compiled "pvserver" without
MPI, so I'm not sure whether this is the problem.  (But I'm not
sure what's going on with MPI.)


I'll attach the "CMakeCache.txt" file since that may provide a
clue to someone who knows what they're looking for -- I didn't
notice anything that would indicate why no "pvserver".


As for the MPI issue, I continue to get a message of this type:

---------
[ 19%] Building CXX object 
VTK/Parallel/MPI/CMakeFiles/vtkParallelMPI.dir/vtkMPIController.cxx.o
Linking CXX shared library 
../../../lib/libvtkParallelMPI-pv4.0.so/usr/bin/ld: 
/N/soft/cle4/paraview/MPI/install-3.0.4/lib/libmpich.a(setbotf.o):

[VTK/Parallel/MPI/CMakeFiles/vtkParallelMPI.dir/all] Error 2
make: *** [all] Error 2
----------

So the MPI version that I'm using is MPICH 3.0.4, and I've compiled
it myself, and I set environment variables to cause the -fPIC compile
flag to be used, but that doesn't seem to help.  Not sure what's
going on there, or what command to run to verify that the -fPIC
flag took.


I'm using this version of gcc/g++ for both paraview and MPICH:
	g++ (GCC) 4.8.1 20130531 (Cray Inc.)


There is one other thing I'm mention in case it's related -- the
Plugin's don't compile.  I have to disable all the plugins in order
to get through the compilation process.


Thoughts?

	Thank you in advance,
	Bill

Dear Bill,

Get similar errors on Beacon using Intel MPI. Serial version compiles
with all plugins turned off, turning on MPI option seems to prevent
compilation of VTK.

Message-ID: <CALa2jifCBnf8LPrDa=1czaJ5iUZgrgX506EYcS4ezO9ByW57rA@mail.gmail.com>

I found that when I enable "Use Multi_Core" in the settings and restart
paraview,one of my cpu is 100% used,but I have not done anything.If I set "
Number of Cores to Use" to 4,both of my cpus is 100% used.I think it is
crazy.WHat does this mean?

This is because the MPI we link in has a spin lock in it. The CPUs are
busily waiting on incoming messages.

    Restore lighting settings after render.

    With several implementations of Mesa, not restoring the
    light-model-color-control to default was causing weird rendering
as reported on
    the mailing lists. The render window would randomly show garbage or single
    color, etc. The issues seems to stemming from the fact that
separate-specular
    color control was not restored to the original value after it was
changed. It
    must be noted that glPushAttrib/glPopAttrib was not taking care of these
    parameters. Hence we explictly restore these to the default if needed.

Hi Bill,

It sounds like you've not configured your build correctly.

yes. it's Cray what's the point of running a serial build there?

don't do that, :-). Better use highly optimized Cray MPT on Cray systems.

You need to set MPI_C_INCLUDE_PATH/MPI_CXX_INCLUDE_PATH and 
MPI_C_LIBRARIES/MPI_CXX_LIBRARIES.

Make sure your using PrgEnv-gnu then you can dump the libraries and 
paths that are used with "CC --verbose". Also CRAY_LD_LIBRARY_PATH can 
be helpful for getting the right system paths.

If you're trying to static link, that's a known issue and was just 
recently fixed. IMO It's better to have them off when static linking 
anyway, cause they'll *all* be automatically loaded on the server side 
and you'll need to do the same in the client(or it will crash) which is 
a bit of a pain, and confusing for new users.

Hi Bill,

I'd suggest looking at the settings at
http://open.cdash.org/viewNotes.php?buildid=3043527. Burlen set up that
dashboard for building on Hopper at NERSC and I often check his settings
when I try to do other Cray builds. It may not be exactly what you need but
it should be fairly close.

Regards,
Andy

I read on the wiki about a script to execute and display the hostname and DISPLAY of each rank of a parallel pvserver job.

import os
import subprocess

display = os.getenv('DISPLAY')
hostname = subprocess.Popen(['hostname'], stdout=subprocess.PIPE).communicate()[0].strip()
print hostname, display

However, the hostname line does not work for me. It returns an empty string. I use v4.0.1
Has there been any changes to this procedure?

Jean,

If you manually run "hostname" on the machine does it produce a valid
output? Also try using the full path to the hostname executable in the
Popen() call.

Bingo!

using '/bin/hostname' did the trick.

Short answer: The multi core option uses MPI, and the MPI library intentionally runs the cores at 100%

This link on the wiki has more information.

Thanks, Andy. The CMakeLists.txt for my plugin is copied below with newly added lines for python wrapping in orange:

-----------------------------
if(NOT ParaView_SOURCE_DIR)
  find_package(ParaView)
  include("${PARAVIEW_USE_FILE}")
  include (ParaViewPlugins)
else()
  # we're building from within ParaView Source.
endif()

include_directories(${VTK_INCLUDE_DIRS})
include(wrap-python.cmake)

# create a paraview plugin containing server manager xml and the server
# manager classes to build
# this plugin can be loaded on the server side

ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN(SMVorticity "1.0"
  SERVER_MANAGER_XML VorticityFilter.xml
  SERVER_MANAGER_SOURCES VorticityFilter.cxx)

target_link_libraries(SMVorticity ${deps})

if(VTK_WRAP_PYTHON)
  wrap_python(SMVorticity "${sources}")
endif()
-----------------------------

The orange lines are added by following http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2012-May/024855.html which works well and builds my filter and also wraps it in Python (i.e., it generates libSMVorticity.a and libSMVorticityPythonD.a). I have also verified the plugin is indeed loaded into pvserver and pvpython in paraview built bin directory.

However, I still got "name not defined" error in coprocessing script when creating this filter by name "VorticityOfUnstructuredDataSet" in python script. I have a couple of specific questions I am currently investigating and hoping to get some inputs from experts in the list:

1. I am not sure where this name "VorticityOfUnstructuredDataSet" (exported by coprocessing script generator plugin) comes from, the only clue I can see is in plugin.cmake, where the plugin is specified with DESCRIPTION "Vorticity Of Unstructured DataSet" and in VorticityFilter.xml, where the plugin is given a label of "Vorticity Of Unstructured DataSet." Should this name be defined somewhere such as in some python file in paraview python site-packages?

2. I did try to add PV_PLUGIN_IMPORT macros to the adaptor since I am using Catalyst, however, the plugin symbol "pv_plugin_instance_SMVorticity" is undefined in the adaptor static lib (the same plugin symbol is defined in pvserver), hence I got an undefined error when linking simulation code to the adaptor. I did try to add my plugin static lib (in which the plugin symbol is defined) to the adaptor target via target_link_libraries before linking to vtkPVPythonCatalyst, but that does not seem to take any effect. For some reason I am still investigating, my plugin lib does not get to link to the adaptor via target_link_libraries. What I did is to go to src directory in the cross target and modified CMakeLists.txt for PhastaAdaptor, then went to corresponding paraview-build directory, and did "make clean" followed by "make" to rebuild PhastaAdaptor lib. Is there something obvious that I did not do correctly?

Thanks for any inputs!

Hong

Can you share your plugin or at least the CMakeLists.txt for your plugin? Have you tried with any other plugins that get packaged with ParaView to see if they work?

If you're using Catalyst, I would suggest adding in the PV_PLUGIN_IMPORT_INIT macros to the adaptor.

Thanks! I did put my plugin inside ParaView/Plugins in the same way as other Plugins, and enabled it when building ParaView superbuild on Titan. I can see the static lib for the Plugin is built in paraview-build/lib directory. And yes, I did use a plugin and load it via Tools|Manage Plugins when creating python coprocessing script. However, it looks like my plugin is not loaded automatically even though it is built by ParaView superbuild. Perhaps I should still follow the link http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Plugin_HowTo#Plugins_in_Static_Applications but I am having some difficulty in following the info in the link to do what is suggested. Specifically, to what file should I insert two macros? It does not sound right to insert them into my custom plugin cxx file. Where should I add two macros to get my custom filter plugin to be loaded and wrapper into python module? I see "LoadPlugin" function defined in simple.py to call servermanager.LoadPlugin(filename, remote) which I am thinking perhaps should be called to load my plugin before my python coprocessing script is executed, but not sure whether this is the case or not.

Thanks for any suggestions!

Hong

Utkarsh pointed out that you still need to follow http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Plugin_HowTo#Plugins_in_Static_Applications
when the plugin is external to ParaView. If you put your plugin inside ParaView/Plugins, then it is done automatically.

I think that information is out of date. I believe that is done automatically now.

Otherwise Andy is right. Putting the filter inside a plugin a good way to go. The plugin infrastructure will make it so that when you provide the XML that describes your vtk class, ParaView's build system will automatically wrap it into a proxy and python class so that ParaView will be able to use it.

Also, I recommend trying it on a local static build first. That way the build time will be less and development will be quicker. Once you can load you plugin locally, then you should only have to compile on titan once.

Did you use a plugin to add in your custom filter when creating the Python co-processing script? I'm not sure how plugins are "loaded" for static builds but you may want to look at http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Plugin_HowTo#Plugins_in_Static_Applications. If that doesn't work, we'll have to figure out some other way to do it.

Hello,

I set up a pipeline that used a custom filter I developed and exported it as a python script for coprocessing. I have made sure the static library for my custom filter is built and available in paraview-build/lib directory, and I have also linked this custom filter static library along with Catalyst libs to the simulation code for coprocessing. However, when I run the simulation linked with ParaView coprocessing for in-situ visualization, I got "NameError: name 'MyCustomizedFilterName' is not defined" error when the line of my customized filter in my python coprocessing script is read in for pipeline coprocessing. What should I do to get my custom filter wrapped in python so that it can be recognized and used as part of the python pipeline script for coprocessing? Any advice and suggestions are very much appreciated.

Thanks,

Hong

Subject: [Paraview] Open tecplot data format using paraview
Message-ID: <CAOQ90zFU9cm2K6qzyyPyaaNEJfeOt88myrKCiYG9VKZbvUKEWg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

Now I have a tecplot file *.tec which can be displayed correctly. This mesh
is 3D fields for an unstructured mesh. There are six quantities, three
coordinates x, y, z, and three physical quantities. The three physical
quantities are stored at the cell centroids because I use finite volume
method. The header is like this

TITLE="CFDmesh"
VARIABLES="X","Y","Z","t1","t2","t3"
ZONE N=27546, E=141356 ,DATAPACKING=BLOCK, ZONETYPE=FETETRAHEDRON
VARLOCATION=([1-3]=NODAL)
VARLOCATION=([4-6]=CELLCENTERED)

When I open this file using the option Tecplot file (ViSit), I failed and
there is no any image displayed in paraview. Does any body know how can I
correctly this kind of tecplot in paraview? I use paraview 4.0.1. Thank you
very much.

best regards,
Huangwei

First, I am copying arrays in the PF, so I should be able to manipulate either input or output, but neither works 
It is also a composite (Exodus dataset) 

First version - error is can't find output.Points 

import math 

def process_block(block): 
   displ=block.PointData['DISPL'] 
   # Coords of Points are locked into individual Point structures 
   # Assume Displacements applied (Points are deformed) 
   numPts=output.GetNumberOfPoints() 
#   for i in range(numPts): 
#      #x_coords[i], y_coords[i], z_coords[i] = output.GetPoint(i) 

   x_coords=output.Points[:,0] 
   y_coords=output.Points[:,1] 
   z_coords=output.Points[:,2] 
   x_undef=x_coords-displ[:,0] 
   y_undef=y_coords-displ[:,1] 
   z_undef=z_coords-displ[:,2] 
   # Undeformed scalar Coordinates 
   block.PointData.append(x_undef,"X_undef") 
   block.PointData.append(y_undef,"Y_undef")   
   block.PointData.append(z_undef,"Z_undef") 
   # Deformed scalar Coordinates 
   block.PointData.append(x_coords,"X_def")

   # Calc angles (no atan2 in vtk) 
   Angles_undef=math.atan2(z_undef,x_undef) 
   block.PointData.append(Angles_undef,"Angle_undef") 

for block in output: 
   process_block(block) 

For second version I comment out x_coords=output.Points[;0] and use 
#   for i in range(numPts): 
#      #x_coords[i], y_coords[i], z_coords[i] = output.GetPoint(i) 

This error is can't find output.GetPoint 

Both of these are used in examples online of Programmable Filter, so what am I missing? 
I have substituted input for output above and no change.   
Also, output.GetNumberOfPoints works, so why doesn't output.GetPoints work? 

Also, I don't understand what object I should examine to find all the member functions within Input and Output within the Programmable Filter

Thanks

but neither does.   Any hints
First, I am copying arrays in the PF, so I should be able to manipulate 
either input or output, but neither works
It is also a composite (Exodus dataset)

First version - error is can't find output.Points

import math

def process_block(block):
   displ=block.PointData['DISPL']
   # Coords of Points are locked into individual Point structures
   # Assume Displacements applied (Points are deformed)
   numPts=output.GetNumberOfPoints()
#   for i in range(numPts):
#      #x_coords[i], y_coords[i], z_coords[i] = output.GetPoint(i)

   x_coords=output.Points[:,0]
   y_coords=output.Points[:,1]
   z_coords=output.Points[:,2]
   x_undef=x_coords-displ[:,0]
   y_undef=y_coords-displ[:,1]
   z_undef=z_coords-displ[:,2]
   # Undeformed scalar Coordinates
   block.PointData.append(x_undef,"X_undef")
   block.PointData.append(y_undef,"Y_undef") 
   block.PointData.append(z_undef,"Z_undef")
   # Deformed scalar Coordinates
   block.PointData.append(x_coords,"X_def")
   block.PointData.append(y_coords,"Y_def")
   block.PointData.append(z_coords,"Z_def")
   # Calc angles (no atan2 in vtk)
   Angles_undef=math.atan2(z_undef,x_undef)
   block.PointData.append(Angles_undef,"Angle_undef")

for block in output:
   process_block(block)

For second version I comment out x_coords=output.Points[;0] and use 
#   for i in range(numPts):
#      #x_coords[i], y_coords[i], z_coords[i] = output.GetPoint(i)

This error is can't find output.GetPoint

Both of these are used in examples online of Programmable Filter, so what 
am I missing?
I have substituted input for output above and no change. 
Also, output.GetNumberOfPoints works, so why doesn't output.GetPoints 
work?

Thanks

but neither does.   Any hints 
First, I am copying arrays in the PF, so I should be able to manipulate 
either input or output, but neither works 
It is also a composite (Exodus dataset) 

First version - error is can't find output.Points 

import math 

def process_block(block): 
   displ=block.PointData['DISPL'] 
   # Coords of Points are locked into individual Point structures 
   # Assume Displacements applied (Points are deformed) 
   numPts=output.GetNumberOfPoints() 
#   for i in range(numPts): 
#      #x_coords[i], y_coords[i], z_coords[i] = output.GetPoint(i) 

   x_coords=output.Points[:,0] 
   y_coords=output.Points[:,1] 
   z_coords=output.Points[:,2] 
   x_undef=x_coords-displ[:,0] 
   y_undef=y_coords-displ[:,1] 
   z_undef=z_coords-displ[:,2] 
   # Undeformed scalar Coordinates 
   block.PointData.append(x_undef,"X_undef") 
   block.PointData.append(y_undef,"Y_undef") 
   block.PointData.append(z_undef,"Z_undef") 
   # Deformed scalar Coordinates 
   block.PointData.append(x_coords,"X_def") 
   block.PointData.append(y_coords,"Y_def") 
   block.PointData.append(z_coords,"Z_def") 
   # Calc angles (no atan2 in vtk) 
   Angles_undef=math.atan2(z_undef,x_undef) 
   block.PointData.append(Angles_undef,"Angle_undef") 

for block in output: 
   process_block(block) 

For second version I comment out x_coords=output.Points[;0] and use 
#   for i in range(numPts): 
#      #x_coords[i], y_coords[i], z_coords[i] = output.GetPoint(i) 

This error is can't find output.GetPoint 

Both of these are used in examples online of Programmable Filter, so what 
am I missing? 
I have substituted input for output above and no change. 
Also, output.GetNumberOfPoints works, so why doesn't output.GetPoints 
work? 

Thanks
