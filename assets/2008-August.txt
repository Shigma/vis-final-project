Subject: [Paraview] Are there any standard benchmarks?
Message-ID: <9A2F484137344CDFA0D7935946C990DA@grimoire>

Hi All,

I am highly suspicious of the rendering speed of our cluster (namely: a
single low-end machine will beat an 8-node cluster, each note with an Nvidia
Quadro card...).

Are there any published benchmark results I can compare against? If not, it
might be something to be considered, look at the Top 500 SuperComputers. Is
there such a list for a rendering cluster? Bit of a distraction, but a good
advert for ParaView :o)

Cheers,

Ian

Subject: [Paraview] Caching within a class, avoiding vtkGeometryFilter
Message-ID: <E05ABC9A7FBFB942B70D7533AF5BE68D02A3DD82@augexmsg001.euro.corp.dir>

I've now had a bit of time to picking up on my old problem:
[http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2008-May/007917.html]

Even after I have some caching within the reader (thus sparing most
I/O), I see that a large amount of time is actually being spent in
vtkGeometryFilter.

If we assume, for simplicity, that the geometry represented by the
reader is invariant over time but the field values can change, how can
this be coded to have the pipeline not update the geometry, but just
update the field values?  Since the geometry doesn't change, the speed
of examining such transient data should only be marginally slower than
changing between various fields at a single time step.

To make it a bit easier, I'm ignoring the field values and within the
RequestData() method I have something like this:


vtkMultiBlockDataSet* output = vtkMultiBlockDataSet::SafeDownCast
(
    outputVector
        ->GetInformationObject(0)
        ->Get(vtkMultiBlockDataSet::DATA_OBJECT())
);

... do something with UPDATE_TIME_STEPS() and set 
    bool needsUpdate = true/false;


// first time
if (!output0_)
{
    output0_ = vtkMultiBlockDataSet::New();
    needsUpdate = true;
}

if (needsUpdate)
{
    UpdateReaderGeometry(output);
    output0_->ShallowCopy(output);
    cout<< "full UPDATE ---------\n";
}
else
{
    output->ShallowCopy(output0_);
    cout<< "cached UPDATE ---------\n";
}

I actually don't know if this is a reasonable approach, but it doesn't
segfault and paraview still displays the geometry at each time step.
Nonetheless, the modification time of 'output' still causes the
GeometryFilter to execute and the field values are not yet copied.

Rebuilding the field values from scratch is fast enough that I may not
need to cache them, but how can I get the output not to re-trigger the
GeometryFilter?

Thanks,

Hi David,

Thank you for the information.
An immediate solution would have been nice, but from John's posting it
already seems to be going in the right directions, although the timeline
looks rather uncertain.

The filters menu should be disabled when paraview starts. Until you
either read a file of use a source to create some data, there is
nothing to apply a filter onto.

After you load the file, be sure to push the accept button. Once you
do that the file will be fully loaded, and then the filters and
sources menus will be available again and ready to either create new
data, or operate on the data you have just loaded.

cheers,
Dave DeMarle

Subject: [Paraview] Getting data into Paraview to build 3D volume
Message-ID: <BAY143-W23FB0D18BF8E09739537608A7E0@phx.gbl>


Hello
 
I know this is a very broad-based query but would like to get some pointers. I normally work with GMT (netCDF) files but these at present (at least in GMT) can only store one variable, e.g. lat, long, elevation or x,y,gravity etc. The latest netCDF convention does support multi-scalar properties, and mult-levels via the COARDS convention, this however is not an export option in the latest GMT (4.3.1).
 
My question is really one of how can I import data into Paraview to generate a volume of data, as opposed to just a series of layers? As I see it, I need to get the data into a format like XYZ (for position in the volume) and then one or more variables to describe the scalar function at the given position.
 
Presently, I could export ascii XYZ data from GMT to generate say x,y,gravity at level 0, and then x,y,gravity at level 1 etc...but it does seem that Paraview expects the data in a more structured and defined format, with which to generate a volume.
 
There is a "roundabout" way to get netCDF files into Paraview via VisIt 1.9.0, and export as VTK, but this will only export things as simple layers (XYZ), and not build a volume from a series of layers.
 
I think it would be useful to at least have a in-depth tutorial guide explaining how to get tabulated ascii data into Paraview and the construction of data volumes from 2D information.
 
If there are alternative methods of getting data into Paraview then I'd be interested to know.
 
Thanks
 
Lester

How about writing an netCDF importer? I am not even sure if I haven't 
seen one reported on the list.

Hello Dominik
 
Thanks for the suggestion. I have seen various variants on the netCDF importer but all require the paraview source code to be compiled, not something I do personally. The problem with netCDF is that you end up dealing with two variants, one which only accepts a single variable like XYZ where z would be say elevation, and in effect you have a 2D layer. The other variant is based on the COARDS convention and allows multiple layers and variables to be built in to netCDF - this is not so easy to construct.
 
It does seem that Paraview is great if you can get your data into a suitable format, otherwise it seems to be a lot of effort. In that respect, I do feel that having more generic import options, and a built in netCDF option, would be a big benefit to users, particularly working in geophysics.

certainly, you can convert such data to a format required by VTK volume 
data. see technical papers -> format specification somewhere on the vtk 
page how such file would have to look like.

I do think that support for cgns or netcdf would attract more people to 
Paraview. But as you say this is not trivial as such formats have 
structures, zones or layers in them. Good idea for a concrete project, 
just need to get funding.

Subject: [Paraview] help with distribute polydata
Message-ID: <e8f823eb0808040036re8b0494rb8511cd6dd9923db@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,
We are using a threadedcontroller for rendering in different threads. Now
we want to divide polydata into  different threads. I already saw there is a
class called vtkRedistributePolyData in paraview, but I am not sure how to
use it. Could please let me know how to divide polydata among multiple
threads ?

Thanks

Subject: [Paraview] "had to make up a value for selection": what am I
	doing wrong?
In-Reply-To: <20080729.221144.168230353.oshima@eng.niigata-u.ac.jp>
Message-ID: <E05ABC9A7FBFB942B70D7533AF5BE68D02A3DD87@augexmsg001.euro.corp.dir>

Taking Takuya's hint, I reverted to revision 1.6 of

  Qt/Components/pqSignalAdaptorSelectionTreeWidget.cxx

and it did indeed stop the multitude of "had to make up a value" that
were cluttering up my message window.

The problem arises in my cases when the number of entries in a
vtkDataArraySelection changes - eg, new fields or mesh parts appear or
disappear between time-steps.
Perhaps this hint might help in localizing the problem.

Mark,

Thanks for the investigation. Let me take a look at it. Problem is 
indeed due to arrays appearing.

there are several packages that should be installable on an up-to-date
etch debian amd64.

Thanks Utkarsh,

It looks like it might be interesting for multiple domains ... if I get
that far.

Since I have your ear: Is there a way that I can set a reader variable
via the GUI, but not have it be noticed as a modification?

The wish is to be able to change a few reader settings without being
prompted to press 'Apply' and without having RequestData() get called.
If the reader could receive a RequestInformation() instead, it could
update the GUI. Barring that, it could just behave slightly differently
when the next RequestInformation() is executed.

One example would be a 'Rescan' button that would scan for new time
steps without the reader being requested to supply the mesh and results
for the current time again. Another would be to enable/disable reader
mesh caching and/or flush memory etc. 

Thanks,

Mark,

In the XML you can add a <Hints /> element as follows:
<Proxy ...>
  ...
   <Hints>
     <Property name="PropertyToHide" show="0"/>
   </Hints>
</Proxy>

Then the GUI will not create a widget for it when generating a panel. 
The changes to that property should not result in Apply button becoming 
green. However note that the changes to the property will get tracked by 
the undo/redo stack. That can be overridden as well, if needed.

For Rescan, you can always call 
"vtkSMSourceProxy::UpdatePipelineInformation()" which should result in a 
call to RequestInformation() on the algorithm.

Sorry for dusting off an old problem, but I realise today that I cannot 
get demo2() or demo4() working from servermanager.py

The command camera.Elevation(45) does not hang, but it returns an error:

  File 
"/local/apps/ParaView3Build/Utilities/VTKPythonWrapping/paraview/servermanager.py", 
line 1803, in demo4
    c.Elevation(95)
AttributeError: Elevation

I am using paraview cvs.

What this problem completely resolved? did I miss a hint?

But I'd actually like exactly the opposite - to have a widget shown on
the GUI that I can interactively change without the rest of the GUI
noticing the change (and affecting the Apply button).

The hand-waving settings:

   <Hints>
     <Property name="MyProperty" show="1" GUImodificationTime="0"/>
   </Hints>

I also thought that is_internal="1" on an IntProperty might have done
the trick, but the also suppresses creation of the widget.

Okay, that answers that 'callback' part of the question ... I just need
the other bits of magic.

One possibility is that we use the "immediate_update" attribute 
specified on the property to indicate to the auto-generated GUI that the 
property needs to be pushed immediately when the GUI changes, without 
waiting for (or affecting) "Apply".

Wonder what the rest of the team thinks about it? Are there many 
use-cases where this could be useful?

Mark, why don't you add a feature request to the bug tracker?

Hey John,

I'm trying to make sure I understand your question -- would your  
problem be solved if your particles had a Global ID associated with  
them, which was a unique "tag" that didn't change over time? (Then,  
the selection type could be "global id" and shouldn't reorder when  
time is stepped back to zero.)

I've had to add a Global ID assignment to my version of the Xdmf  
reader so that my animated particle data could be selected and have  
attributes plotted over time, etc.

Talk to you later,
-Eric

Jean,

There was another issue with wrapping that propped up since the original 
fix. I've committed a fix to Utilities/VTKPythonWrapping/paraview/vtk.py

It looks to me as if a bugfix (1. in my previous post) surfaced
another possible bug that had been hidden somewhere in the server-GUI
property link (2. and 3.). I really appreciate your inspection.

No. My particles already have a global Id which I use to track them 
independently. The trouble is (was), that when you select some in 
ParaView, it uses their Id taken from the index they have in the 
vtkPoints list (or Cell Id if using verts) and noy my "ParticleId" 
array. This order can change arbitrarily in my data. As time steps 
change - the selected points constantly shift about.

I fixed the problem by creating a vtkSnapshot filter which simply 
captures a dataset when you create it. It caches the result and never 
updates anything from then on. This way I can select a bunch of 
particles using the mouse, copy the active selection, then snapshot it. 
I then pass this into the TTemporalTrails filter as the selction input 
(you might need to update your copy to get this filter). I can now pick 
individual (or groups) of particles at time T=large, capture them, go 
back to T=0 and draw pathlines only for thos eI wanted. Nice. This is 
also handy because particles can be injected at differnt times and if 
their Id doesn't exist at some T value, the trails filter just skips 
them. The ones selected get drawn - if they exist.

Hi,

If the feature is to be added, is it possible to have a simple push
button in the panel only by writing the server manager XML? I know the
ExodusII reader has this feature but it has a complete custom UI
panel.

As to Mark's particular case I believe the feature request is closely
related to the tracker entries #7298 and #7314 (and I would like this
feature too).

Hey John,

That feature sounds great, but it still sounds like this should be  
taken care of by a Global ID. If the reader supports it, your  
ParticleId array could be set as a vtkIdTypeArray attached to the  
PointData using SetGlobalIds().

When I have point data of this type (where points come into and pop  
out of existence and change their order in the arrays, but I have  
assigned global ids) I can run ahead to an arbitrary time step, select  
some points, then go to the Selection Inspector and pull the Selection  
Type down to Global IDs. From there if I jump back to the first time  
step it keeps the correct selection, and it will behave correctly  
whether that Global ID exists only for part of the time series or the  
whole thing. So, it seems like the Global ID fills the same role as  
your "snapshot".

It sounds like your solution works great, so the only reason I'm  
chiming in on this is that Global IDs are an under-used, but existing  
part of VTK and ParaView, and may be a more natural and/or consistent  
solution than using a filter to do the same job. The downside is that  
readers would need to be extended so that they know how to assign that  
ParticleId array as a Global ID. In the VTK XML readers this is broken  
right now, and Xdmf / HDF5 doesn't have this capacity natively. (In my  
little Xdmf reader mod, I added an "ID" AttributeType as the flag for  
the .xmf file -- HDF 5 doesn't include the concept of an IdType  
array.) Exodus II is the main format I've seen which has good support  
for global ids.

Talk to you later,
-Eric

Filters within ParaView have no access the camera for a variety of reasons.  If you want the filter to update with new camera positions, you will have to integrate it into a representation/view.  Representations and views can be added with plugins, they just take a bit more work than adding a filter.

A new feature that is available on the ParaView development branch and will be available in 3.4 is the ability for a plugin to add a new representation to the 3D View (the default view within ParaView).  Right now, the feature is undocumented, but documentation should be coming soon.  Perhaps Utkarsh can fill in here.

Unfortunately there is no standard benchmark process for ParaView.
A standard process on lines of EnSight could be nice.
http://www.ensight.com/rendering-performance-tests-13.html

I have access to large number of processors/cores, different interconnect
options like Ethernet and infiniband and different MPI implementations.

We have quite large datasets and will soon be generating very large
amount CFD data (in the form of complex unstructured grids).

These testes could later be used by other users for quick comparison
and help them with quick decisions.

I am looking for recommendations for this process. If anyone done
anything similar to this, please give me some inputs to standardize
the process.

I am trying to find documentation of time support in VTK/Paraview. I 
found a Wiki page about time support, but that is very general. I have 
specific questions e.g. how do I inform PV about time extents, timesteps 
etc. I assume this should be done in RequestInformation, but setting it 
there does not make PV aware of it. Should it be set somewhere else too?

Any pointers are appreciated.

You should set the vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::TIME_STEPS()
information key on the output vtkInformationVector to a list of the time
steps your filter can output (or set
vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::TIME_RANGE() to the min/max
values if your filter behaves continuously over time).

Assuming that you are not populating a vtkTemporalDataSet yourself,
your RequestData() member should examine the
vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_TIME_STEPS() value
of the output vtkInformationVector object and fill the output dataset
with the first time step listed. Then it must set the
vtkDataObject::DATA_TIME_STEPS() key on the output vtkInformationVector
to the first time step from UPDATE_TIME_STEPS(). Because you
are not populating a vtkTemporalDataSet directly, the pipeline will
call your RequestData() member with a different value in
UPDATE_TIME_STEPS() each time. The pipeline executive stores
all these datasets as blocks in one big vtkTemporalDataSet that
gets passed to the next filter downstream.

If your filter does populate vtkTemporalDataSet objects directly,
you are responsible for adding one block to the output for each
value in the UPDATE_TIME_STEPS() vector and setting DATA_TIME_STEPS()
to contain the same values as UPDATE_TIME_STEPS().

For ParaView, you should also have this in your reader/filter's XML:
     <DoubleVectorProperty
         name="TimestepValues"
         repeatable="1"
         information_only="1">
       <TimeStepsInformationHelper/>
if your filter has discrete time steps or:
     <DoubleVectorProperty name="TimeRange" information_only="1">
       <TimeRangeInformationHelper/>
     </DoubleVectorProperty>
if your filter output varies continuously with time.

Are you using all the keys above and still not getting the correct
behavior from ParaView?

I am trying to find documentation of time support in VTK/Paraview. I
found a Wiki page about time support, but that is very general. I have
specific questions e.g. how do I inform PV about time extents, timesteps
etc. I assume this should be done in RequestInformation, but setting it
there does not make PV aware of it. Should it be set somewhere else too?

Any pointers are appreciated.

Message-ID: <BAY143-W55AD41B46665B4E228F3BC8A7B0@phx.gbl>


Hello Massimo
 
Thanks for the idea about using GRASS to get to vtk. I have downloaded the software and will get to grips with it over a few days, but it does seem to offer the best compromise for getting data from NetCDF files to VTK format. I noticed it offers a quick input option via r.in.xyz which means that a straight export from GMT can be used; plus GRASS will let you load several layers to build a volume set.
 
It's the best option so far, but clearly we could really do with the similar options as default import in Paraview ..... well we can wish I guess!
 
Cheers
 
Lester

It sounds like your paraview was not compiled with MPI support. The
mpi launcher (mpich's mpiexec) adds certain command line arguments
when launching an mpi executable and removes them during the MPI
initialization phase (MPI_Initialize). If pvserver is not compiled
with mpi, those arguments are never removed and you get the error you
mentioned.

Add this to the XML for the reader (taken from vtkTimeSourceExample),
ParaView needs the helper to recognize what the time steps are to
populate the GUI with.

      <DoubleVectorProperty
          name="TimeStepValues"
          repeatable="1"
          information_only="1">
        <TimeStepsInformationHelper/>

In the server manager XML for the reader, you need to add the special property "TimestepValues" with the subtag TimeStepsInformationHelper.  The subtag will automatically populate the property with the time steps reported from the pipeline, and ParaView will in turn interpret the data as time steps.

      <DoubleVectorProperty name="TimestepValues"
                            repeatable="1"
                            information_only="1">
        <TimeStepsInformationHelper />
        <Documentation>
          This magic property sends time information to the animation
          panel.  ParaView will then automatically set up the animation to
          visit the time steps defined in the file.
        </Documentation>
      </DoubleVectorProperty>

It does not apply in this case, but you may be interested to know that there is a sister special property called TimeRange with a subtag TimeRangeInformationHelper that gets the time range.  This is important for readers (and other pipeline objects) that support a continuous range of time.  It's rare, but it happens.

     <DoubleVectorProperty name="TimeRange" information_only="1">
       <TimeRangeInformationHelper/>
     </DoubleVectorProperty>

That works, thanks a lot!

Oh yes, thanks, that is a useful remark. It could be used to interpolate 
the solutions between the requested timesteps... not quite so rare :)

Thanks again,

There actually already is a filter that does that: Temporal Interpolator.  Unless your file format has special information that suggests a better than linear interpolation, you can use the existing filter to save yourself some time.

I was really hoping there exists one already :) Yes, I think linear

Hi Rick,

Ah - nothing formal. Something is defintely *wrong*, there is a huge lag
between dragging and rendering. The same dataset must hit [from eyeballing
it] ~10fps on a single machine.

I was wondering if it was the dataset, so if anyone out there has a dataset
that renders sanely on cluster, and has a rough fps...

I am eventually aiming to try rendering very large datasets via ParaView,
but these datasets are output from Fluent - and its not looking promising if
I can't cope with something < 1 million polys! :o(

Regards,

Ian

PV works fine on our cluster for the test case using max 8 processors 
and 16-partritions but gives this error with 32-partitions



ERROR: In

Question is:
1-my data for 32-partitions is wrong or
2-the paraview-mpi installation is not correct

If someone has run 32 processors successfully, a solution to find the 
our problem is:
1-I give you our data to test on your installation or
2-You give me your data for say 32 processors and I test it on our system.

The number one issue with ParaView is making sure you have your configuration correct.

Anyone having trouble with performance or thinking about doing benchmarking should go to the 'Server Setup' section of the ParaView wiki. :)

http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView

The 'Server Setup' section contains a LOT of information about common issues associated with X windows, servers, clients, etc...

Hello,

I have installed ParaView 3.2.3 on Intel AMD64 with Ubuntu 64 bit.  Currently I am dependent on Intel

is absent on my machine.


Can someone inform me how to enable Direct Rendering on Linux machine ? With indirect rendering,
I cann't hope to get interact with big dataset.

Thanks.

Actually, I think a new view type that applies the silhouette filters to 
all the props rendered in the scene might be more appropriate. There are 
plugin examples that talk about how to add a new view to ParaView. Thoughts?

I don't know if it is related, I have noticed some strange interaction
between the time-selector at the top of the window and the slider in the
animation view.

In the EnSight reader RequestData() both
      outInfo->Set(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::TIME_STEPS(),
                   &uniqueTimeValues[0],
                   numTimeValues);
and
      outInfo->Set(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::TIME_RANGE(),
                   timeRange, 2);

are set. The interface has 
  <DoubleVectorProperty name="TimestepValues" information_only="1">
but no
  <DoubleVectorProperty name="TimeRange" information_only="1">


I can use the animation slider control to examine transient data, but
while the time-selector at the top shows the current time, but it can't
always be used to index through the values. The behaviour seems to be
related to particular cases itself and if it has been opened with
--data=Ensight.case, or via File/Open. For the cases where it doesn't
work, it is quite reproducible. 

Could this be somehow related to it not setting
vtkDataObject::DATA_TIME_STEPS() as David's email stated?
The only reader that does seem to be using this is the vtkXMLReader.

Regardless of that, I also noticed either a Qt/GUI bug or some
strangeness in the time handling.  Using the animation slider to scroll
through time works mostly okay, but using the time-selector causes the
slider itself to get out of sync. The current time reported within the
slider is correct, but the slider position is all wrong.
Furthermore, even with snap-to-timesteps, weird times are getting
selected. Eg, with the time steps (0 2.75803e-5 e3-5 6e-6) it tries to
snap to 2e-05.

If there has already been a bug report, I can also tack on some test
files.

Hi.  I'm trying to writing a python script that loads a saved state, but I'm having trouble with the server manager:

from paraview import servermanager as sm
c = sm.Connect()
sm.LoadState("test.pvsm")
view = sm.GetRenderView()
view.StillRender()

I set my LD_LIBRARY_PATH and PYTHONPATH to include $HOME/paraview-3.2.1-Linux-x86/lib/paraview-3.2/

But I get the following message for the import line above:

That is correct.

I do not recall seeing any of these before.  Submitting a bug report with data attached would probably help.

Subject: [Paraview] What are the known issues with the Paraview 3.2.2
	servermanager?
Message-ID: <980080.44927.qm@web59513.mail.ac4.yahoo.com>

I'm building an external reader plugin for Paraview 3.2.2 using a proprietary library.  It builds with a few minor warnings but when I run it on a known good file to read it in, paraview exits with a runtime error.  The error states that one of my set methods is not being called from the properties panel as defined in the servermanager XML entry or is being called with incorrect parameters.

I'm using an IntVectorProperty with an EnumerationDomain, another IntVectorProperty with IntRangeDomain from 3 to 50.  All of the other entries in the XML file are known to work correctly.  I've checked and rechecked the spellings of all of the set methods created with the vtkSetMacro.

The error message given by Visual Studio 2005 is that there is a failed assert that requires an unusual exit from the program.  The expression listed when using the debug build of paraview and the debug build of the reader is that in dbgdel.cpp line 52 in the expression _BLOCK_TYPE_IS_VALID(pHead->nBlockUse) .

My system configuration is WindowsXP SP3 on a MacPro with 2 quad-core Xeon processors and 4 GB of RAM running under Boot Camp.  My build environment is Visual Studio 2005 SP1.

Without seeing your source code, I can only guess at the reasons for the non-existent method error.  If you are sure that the names are matching up, then I would assume that the arguments somehow do not match up.  If the arguments disagree in either number or type, you will get the same error as if the name did not match.

If you are having a really hard time tracing down the problem, you can try setting a breakpoint in the function that finds the appropriate method.  The plugin build should have created a file called vtkYourClassNameClientServer.cxx (in the build directory) for every vtkYourClassName.cxx file in your source.  In this file will be the function vtkYourClassNameCommand, which is what will find the appropriate method and call it.  You can set a break point in that function to track how ParaView tries to find the method.

Hello all,

I've discovered that the code in my .DLL is failing upon initialization indicating that something is malformed in it.  The assert means that something is being deallocated that was never allocated in the first place or something like that.  I've tried recompiling the proprietary library as a static library rather than introducing a dependency on another external .DLL just for it to compile.

The thing I find most disturbing about this process is that it builds just fine but fails with a runtime exception.  My .DLL isn't loading properly in the operating system so maybe I should try building it in MacOSX to see if there is an equally disturbing .dylib file waiting for me.

Thanks for your help so far,

--Sam

UPDATE:

Under MacOSX it builds correctly and only complains about not having a default value on the enumeration and mentioned stability issues associated with that.  Since I'm not technically using that variable in the code yet I doubt that would be the culprit.  I suspect this is more of a Windows-related problem than a reader plug-in problem.

Hello again,

Ok, now I think I understand the problem.  The enumeration doesn't display a drop-down gadget but only a normal integer gadget.  It also doesn't constrain the values of the integer being input.

I'm now trying to reproduce the effects of the example code from the ParaView Guide version 3.0 pages 281-283 where a range gadget and slider are replaced by a drop-down gadget.  The catch is that my panel is for a reader, not a filter, and I need to know how to fix my CMake build script.

Thanks for your time,

--Sam

Hey John,

I need to do some more testing, but I may have gotten around that  
'GetDocumentation' error:

First, I deleted the SPHProbePointOverTime from CSCS_SPH_Server.xml  
(since I am trying to fix the Point Sprites problem first). Then, in  
rendering.xml, <PointSpriteRepresentationProxy  
name="PointSpriteRepresentation">, comment out the subproxy exposed  
properties lines for ColorMode and ColorChannelArray, so it looks like  
this:
      ....
       <SubProxy>
         <!--
           Mapper for high-res geometry.
         -->
         <Proxy name="Mapper"
                proxygroup="mappers"
                proxyname="PointSpriteMapper" />
         <ExposedProperties>
           <Property name="LookupTable" />
           <!-- <Property name="ColorMode" /> -->
           <Property name="MapScalars" />
           <Property name="ImmediateModeRendering" />
           <Property name="InterpolateScalarsBeforeMapping" />
           <Property name="UseLookupTableScalarRange" />
           <Property name="ClippingPlanes" />
           <Property name="NumberOfSubPieces" />

           <!-- <Property name="ColorChannelArray" /> -->
           <Property name="AlphaChannelArray" />
           <Property name="RadiusChannelArray" />
           ....

(Maybe the PointSpriteMapper doesn't have these properties to expose?)  
This got me through the "from paraview import servermanager" stage  
using pvpython. Then, to be able to load a saved meshless state file I  
also needed to comment out the line in servermanager.py which Jean  
Favre had trouble with (http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2008-May/008120.html 
)

     rvname =  
vtkSMRenderViewProxy.GetSuggestedRenderViewType(connection.ID)
     if rvname:
         # loader.SetRenderViewXMLName(rvname)
         pm = ProxyManager()
         pm.LoadState(filename, ActiveConnection.ID, loader)

After this I was able to load a state file which displayed points  
using simple point sprites from Python and do a still frame render.  
I'll try more testing tomorrow, but maybe this will allow me to do  
batch animation rendering using the point sprites!

Talk to you later,
-Eric

Subject: [Paraview] Bug in camera animation with parallel projection
Message-ID: <200808070630.31544.hobbsk@ohiou.edu>

ParaView does not do what is expected when saving an animation of camera 
position with parallel projection on.

Though I can add the key frames with the view the way I want, only focal 
point, position, view up, and view angle are saved. Nothing like parallel 
scale is saved. The results are frames that look zoomed in.

I'm using the nightly CVS version of ParaView3. I see this problem with the 
builds on gargon and murron on the dashboard.

I first started to see the problem around the time PV3 came out.

Message-ID: <B325243A-EBBA-4AF4-801D-360295FF976E@usace.army.mil>

Hi,

I'm trying to upgrade to paraview3 built from the cvs  source on Mac  
OSX 10.5.  I use the python wrappers for vtk directly in some python  
code, and I notice that the vtk windows pop up with no frame  (you  
can't do anything to the windows). This had been working using python  
and vtk from fink, which is all based on X11 not Carbon.  Does anybody  
know if there is simple to fix? I was thinking I  might need to  
changed  the vtkRenderWindowInteractor calls to explicitly use QT4,  
but I haven't had any luck with the vtk.qt4 module.

Thanks,
Chris

FWIW ... if you use the "vtkpython" executable instead of "python", your
windows will have window manager decorations.

Message-ID: <497fe5210808071408j7b641378n6c48a961a751b67a@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm looking for a cross-platform way of detecting the build type from C++
code.

The idea is that if the code is being compiled for release, that certain
testing things we do can be eliminated from the release build of our
Paraview.

Something like

#ifdef (CMAKE_RELEASE)
  // do some stuff
#else
  // do other stuff
#endif

would do the trick. Does anyone know the name of the define that I'm looking
for?

Here is a copy of CMake's flags for a ParaView build.

  CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS
  CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_DEBUG            -gdwarf-2
  CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_MINSIZEREL       -Os -DNDEBUG -DQT_NO_DEBUG
  CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_RELEASE          -O3 -DNDEBUG -DQT_NO_DEBUG
  CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_RELWITHDEBINFO   -O2 -gdwarf-2 -DQT_NO_DEBUG

As you can see for a Release build "NDEBUG" is defined so I might try  
the following:

#ifndef (NDEBUG)
	// Debug statements are printed
   std::cout << .... Debug.. blah blah
#else
	 //Really fast release code here.
#endif

You can add a definition equal to the current setting of CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:

ADD_DEFINITIONS(-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE_IS_${CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE}).

Then you can catch if with ifdefs inside the code.

You big Star! - ten points for finding the problem. The 
ColorChannelArray and ColorMode are two inherited properties from the 
base mapper and I had renamed (and then back again) them in one (or 
other) version, but negleged to correct the xml at some point. They were 
dangling properties with no implementation. This also explains a dodgy 
colour selection bug that might be fixed when the xml is corrected.

delete
          <Property name="ColorMode" />
it is the same as MapScalars,

          <Property name="ColorChannelArray" />
should be
          <Property name="ColorArray" />
but actually can be removed because we don't need to expose it here 
(none of the other representations do, it is used directly from the 
mapper property and not via the representation property) (actualkly, 
most of the others don't need to be exposed either probably, never mind).

You have really saved me a lot of pain. Cheers. My python shell is 
working now, woo-hoo!

I'll check in stuff to the pv-m repository later today when I've tested 
a bit more.

Hey John,

I'm glad that helped.

What I've been doing for testing is to save a state file, then load it  
in during a straight Python session, and see if I can animate a time  
series from there. I want to use this eventually to generate batch  
animations using Python along with the Point Sprite representations of  
our data. So far, though, I've only been able to get it to show  
anything on the screen when using the Simple Point Mapper Render Mode.  
The view shows up blank when using a real Point Sprite, and I crashed  
with ShadingLanguage FastSphere. Have you tried anything like this, or  
have you just been using the Python shell within ParaView?

I'll try to figure out where it's looking for the point sprite bitmap  
when rendering from Python, in case that's the problem, but please let  
me know if you have any ideas, too.

Also (sorry that this is a bit off-thread), whenever I try to use  
ShadingLanguage Mapper Render Mode in pv-meshless, I get an error from  
vtkGLSLShader.cxx, line 293 "Shader not compiled!!!". I have the cmake  
flag VTK_USE_GLSL_SHADERS: ON, is there another one I should be  
turning on, too?

Thanks,
-Eric

Hi folks,

I made a first pass at a benchmark script in ParaView. For now, it
creates a sphere and renders it using various settings - at 1M and 2M
polygons resolutions. It either prints the result or saves it as a
csv. To use it,

from the GUI, first connect to a server, then using the Python shell:

> from paraview import benchmark
> benchmark.run('results.csv')

from pvpython:

> from paraview import servermanager, benchmark
> servermanager.Connect() # change this to connect to a server if necessary
> benchmark.run('result.csv')

from pvbatch, either create a py file that has the above code or run
pvbatch as something like:

mpiexec -n 4 ./bin/pvbatch ./Utilities/VTKPythonWrapping/paraview/benchmark.py

This will print out the results to stdout.

Please do run the benchmark and send us the results. We can post them
on the wiki.

Not just from the GUI. You can achieve it using GUI+python:

* Turn off all lights from the Render View Options
* Turn on Ambient of the representation from python with something like:

v = servermanager.GetRenderView()
v.Represenations[0].Ambient = 0.5

Of course, I was lazy and picked the first representation of the first
view. You can get a collection of all views with GetRenderViews() and
iterate until you find the one you want. Which I just realized is not
easy because views are not named. I will create a feature request for
that. Once you have  a view, you get iterate  over its representations
until you find one that has your source/filter as input. Something
like:

pm = servermanager.ProxyManager()
myfilter = pm.GetProxy("sources", "filter name")
for rep in representations:
 if rep.Input[0].Proxy == myfilter:
  rep.Ambient = 0.5
  break

They are equivalent as long as the Input property is not repeatable.
If it is, GetData() should return a list.

I took a look at this. It looks like the PLY reader cannot handle
triangle strips. I could open a version of bunny that is not stripped
without problems. It looks like the reader is based on a PLY library
from Stanford and maybe needs updating...

Hi Stephen,

Does this happen at startup or when you load the data? Did you try to
create a simple source such as the sphere source? We have run ParaView
on more nodes than 32 so it has been done before...

Ah, I misunderstood. You are running on 8 nodes and load a 32 piece
dataset. What is the format?

This is a good solution but it won't work if you save the state and
restore it. What Eric refers to in his response about global ids
should work as well but also support saving state. This same issue
came up related to information visualization where the selection is a
set of nodes from a graph. The decision made there was to add support
for saving out the selection and loading it back.

Nope. No limit to the number of processors. I believe Sandians ran on
~ 200 nodes. We ran pvbatch on 512 on a Cray Xt3 and Blue Gene.

Well, there is a workaround to get it in the GUI, but, in the words of Henry
Ford, "You can have any color you want, as long as its black."  Change the
color of the surface to black and turn off any specular highlighting; you
won't be able to see any shading.

It's not a good solution, but it has the benefit of being easy.

I'm considering the same thing as requested in #7314:
"reload button wold be really nice for watching simulations"
http://paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=7314
which has been discussed in the list so many times.

With a combination of the reload button and the immediate_update
attribute as proposed by Utkarsh, the feature will be much easier to
implement in the reader side.

Subject: [Paraview] Test Data for Particle Tracer
Message-ID: <489D5680.6040108@cscs.ch>

I have a small dataset which I use for testing the particle tracer. It's 
about 1GB (60 timesteps). Now that I'm ready to commit the latest bunch 
of improvements to the particle tracer code, I'd like also to add a test 
or two for it.

1GB seems a tadge on the large side for the standard vtkData cvs 
repository. I've got another that I'll strip out all the scalar fields 
from and reduce the number of time steps (50 currently). I should be 
able to get it down it to a few hundred MB.

Question : Usually we try to keep datasets down to a few MB for vtk 
tests. What is the absolute maximum size that I can get away with for a 
dynamic mesh, multi-block, vector field dataset for testing. Of course 
we could limit it to (say) 5 timesteps, but it'd be nice to have a big 
decent dataset for testing. Many of the bugs etc don't crop up until 
particle cross boundaries etc and a good long run is nice.

Kitware guys - Guidelines?

thanks

JB

I tested data from two independent sources.
1-legacy
2-xml binary data
both work for a 16-piece data set using 4, 8, and 16 processors.
neither works for a 32-piece data set for 4, 8 or 16 processors. 
Therefore it seems that the number of pieces of data cannot exceed the 
maximum number of allowed processors which seems to be 16.

The installation was from the source and not cvs. Thus cmake was used.
I found this with google

//Maximum number of processors available to run parallel applications.
// (see /home/mig/installed/vtkCVS/VTK/CMakeLists.txt for more
// info.)
VTK_MPI_MAX_NUMPROCS:STRING=1

//Flag used by mpi to specify the number of processes, the next
// option will be the number of processes. (see
/home/mig/installed/vtkCVS/VTK/CMakeLists.txt
// for more info.)
VTK_MPI_NUMPROC_FLAG:STRING=-np

But don't know to do with it once the installation has been made.

Hi Berk,

In this case I am using the ParaView reader module included as part of
the OpenFOAM distribution. The GUI has a number of provisions
(checkboxes) for altering the reader's behaviour that should ideally be
modifiable without requiring the reader to re-execute.

These are the switches
1. Include Sets 
2. Include Zones
These two include cell/face/point sets/zones in the list of mesh parts
that can be selected. Once the OpenFOAM mesh is loaded, the zones
information is available and can be included in the list, depending on
whether the user considers it useful or just clutter. Displaying these
on the mesh-parts list leaves the reader output unaltered until the user
explicitly selects a particular set or zone.

3. Show Patch Names
Adds or removes a bunch of vtkTextActors to label the patch (boundary)
region. This can be useful for finding which boundary is where, but
otherwise clutters up the display. Does not affect the reader output. 

4. Cache Mesh
Select if the OpenFOAM mesh information should be cached between
time-steps. This skips reading from disk for the geometry, but
unfortunately until the VTK time handling improves, we cannot exploit
this as much as desired. Does not affect the reader output.


Perhaps rather than a simple 'immediate' property, the checkboxes should
receive even more attributes. AFAIK it is currently not possible for the
reader to change the GUI defaults or values. With vtkDataArray, it is
possible to add a listener, but that causes the GUI state to change and
'Apply' lights up green.

A simple example of wishing to push integer information to the GUI:
In the EnSight reader, the modified version has the default ByteOrder as
"auto detect" (UNKNOWN byte-order). After the Ensight binary files have
been read, the byte-order is known and it could be nice to change the
GUI display to reflect this information.
However, the main motivation is the desire to add a local configuration
file that the reader could parse and dynamically set particular reader
defaults.

I added Utkarsh's suggestions as a note on issue 7314.

Using a custom GUI you can push values from the server to the Client  
GUI. I have done this in one of my own readers. It does take some Qt  
coding to get it done.

Just FYI.

Nope. No such limitation exists. VTK_MPI_MAX_NUMPROCS is only used by
the testing framework to determine how many processes the tests should
use (the same with some of the other VTK_MPI_XXX flags). There is
something else that is causing the problem here. I would not use the
legacy formats by the way. They are not designed to support
distributed data. Out of curiosity, how do you create a 32 piece
legacy file? How are you creating a multi-piece VTK XML datasets?
There are multiple ways of doing it.

As I mentioned it before, the best way of testing parallel
functionality is to start with datasets/source that are known to work.
For polygonal models, I would use the sphere source and jack up the
resolution. For structured data, I would use the wavelet source. For
unstructured data, I would use the wavelet source and then
tetrahedralize it. All of these should work well with > 16 processors.

There seems to be two approaches to parallel visualation.
1-The paraview file contains the global mesh and say 32 processors are 
used to visualize the global data. Maybe I am confused but this would 
seem to be the approach that you suggest above. Else, how would I split 
the above into partitions?
2-The approach we use is we want to avoid writing global mesh files and 
a global .vtu file and instead write a .vtu file for each processor. For 
a computation using 256 processors, 256 separate vtu files are written 
at each time step with each file being approximately 1/256 the size of a 
global file. The idea is to use say 32 paraview processors to visualize 
the 256 vtu files at each time step.

Perfect. This is the right way of doing it. It should work with any
number of nodes and partitions as long as you have enough memory. Is
there a dataset of small to medium size that you can share so that I
can track down the problem? It would be best if I can open it on at
most 8 processors...

I think we should create a new data "repository" for large data. I
don't think repository should be under version control since scm
software do not usually deal well with such files. The tests then
should check if there a CMake variable pointing to such files and run
the tests if yes. This way we can run tests with files bigger than
tiny (which is what we currently allow in the cvs). What do you think?
Having said that, is there no way of generating a smaller artificial
dataset for testing the particle tracker. I am more concerned with how
long it will take to run such a test. Testing time is precious since
we are running a lot of dashboards.

	source?
Message-ID: <296456.15505.qm@web59508.mail.ac4.yahoo.com>

Hi again,

I built the development release of ParaView last Thursday.  Now today I tried to compile a version of a reader plugin for it and it complained that it couldn't find the libray pqComponents.  ParaView was built using an XCode 3.0 project as generated by CMake 2.6-1 and the plugin was built using both a makefile and an XCode project but neither worked.

Is there something I can do to fix my build process?

My hardware is a MacPro with 2 quad-core Intel processors running MacOSX 10.5.4 using 4 Gigs of RAM.

Message-ID: <70A8F03E-1034-4E51-A555-73B646A7C4E6@imts.us>

I have some 2D plot data that I am loading from a file. I would like  
to be able to programmatically set the X Axis data and the Y Data.  
Currently after I load the data and ParaView displays the 2D plot the  
X Axis data is set to "Use Array Index from Y Axis data" in the GUI.  
I would like to have it automatically set to "Use Data Array:" and  
then have it automatically select the correct data set. I see in  
vtkPointData there is the method SetXCoordinates but that does not  
seem to affect anything? Is there another way? Setting the active  
array or something?

Simple example is a Stress vs Strain Plot.

Thanks

Subject: [Paraview] Difficulty in using threshold in a script
Message-ID: <14cf210a0808110900nefe3bcdya4afd07dd5d073f@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

I've been using paraview for a while, but I've recently aquirred the
need to do a lot of visualisations all at once, to save as pngs, so I
thought I would try scripting the commands.  Starting with the example
in the help, and looking through the threshold docs, as I understand
them (I've never programmed python before) I managed to get this
together:

from paraview import servermanager
if not servermanager.ActiveConnection:
	connection = servermanager.Connect()
	
reader = servermanager.sources.LegacyVTKFileReader(FileNames="D:\hetero_atrium\court0000.vtk")

thresh = servermanager.filters.Threshold(Input=reader,
ThresholdBetween=[-100,100])

view = servermanager.CreateRenderView()
rep = servermanager.CreateRepresentation(thresh, view)

view.ResetCamera()
view.StillRender()

which should, I think, read in the input file, apply a threshold of
-100 to 100 and then display the centred view on screen.  However, it
doesn't and instead I just see an empty box.  'Manual' visualization
confirms that the datafile is valid and shouldn't render as black for
the same threshold values.

Any pointers would be appreciated.

Regards,
Jon

That's weird. Is there a libpqComponents.dylib in your build tree (under bin)?

Errrr. I didn't tag for those builds. What do you need it for? Is it
OK if I create a tarball or something? I can do that for the last
snapshot since the source tree is still around...

I'm building the snapshots for Fedora development.  We build from 
source.  Tarballs are the best for reproducibility.

Subject: [Paraview] Xdmf time series loads as Multi-block Dataset
Message-ID: <E0744EC2-1565-46C1-829E-1AA8897B572E@cs.duke.edu>

Hey all,

Maybe I'm behind on my Xdmf XML format again, but my files that a  
month or two ago loaded a time series of unstructured grids now loads  
into ParaView CVS as a Multi-block Dataset with one block for each  
time step at each time point.

Let's say I have 1200 Polyvertex time steps in my file. I can (slowly)  
step through the animation of my grid, but at each time point the  
progress bar is cycling through a bunch of work, and each time point  
lists (in the Information tab Data Hierarchy pane) a Multi-block  
Dataset made up of 1200 Unstructured Grids. Clicking on each of these  
blocks reveals that only the "current" time step block has Data Arrays  
associated with the grid. So, at each time step of the animation, the  
process seems very slow because 1200 blocks are being loaded, only one  
of which actually has real data in it. (The Time pane at the bottom of  
the Information tab always lists the correct time indices and values  
for the whole series.)

Maybe this is just a change in the way time series are dealt with, but  
it is much slower with my data sets, and it made more sense to me to  
have each time step able to be represented as a simple grid, if  
desired. (I have been using a self-modified vtkXdmfReader.cxx file for  
a while, so I'm not sure when this multi-block issue would have  
appeared.)

Thanks,
-Eric

I'm still not seeing pvpython getting installed during an MPI build.  Is 
this intentional?  It is getting built.

Hi, now I know how to animate a scene with python in paraview. It is supposed that it goes like this:
 
# Create an animation scene.scene = animation.AnimationScene();# Add one view.scene.ViewModules = [view];# Update the reader to get the time informationreader.UpdatePipelineInformation()scene.TimeSteps = reader.TimestepValues.GetData()# Animate from 1st time step to lastscene.StartTime = reader.TimestepValues.GetData()[0]scene.EndTime = reader.TimestepValues.GetData()[-1];# Each frame will correspond to a time stepscene.PlayMode = 2; #Snap To Timesteps# Create a special animation cue for time.cue = animation.TimeAnimationCue();cue.AnimatedProxy = view;cue.AnimatedPropertyName = "ViewTime";scene.Cues = [cue];if filename:    writer = vtkSMAnimationSceneImageWriter();    writer.SetFileName(filename);    writer.SetFrameRate(1);    writer.SetAnimationScene(scene.SMProxy);    # Now save the animation.    if not writer.Save():        raise exceptions.RuntimeError, "Saving of animation failed!"
else:    scene.Play()
 
but i've got errors and the output says "name 'animation' is not defined" 
 
1. can you please show me an script example of animation?

Message-ID: <OFF7B31041.6326F632-ON852574A3.004DD0BF-852574A3.004F6DE8@seagate.com>

Hi all,
I am using Paraview to visualize large time-series of data from materials 
simulations.  I've used the file-formats.pdf documentation to convert our 
simulator's file format to ParaView's .VTU unstructured grid format, which 
has been very successful.

I'm having trouble finding information on the PVD file format used to make 
time-series.  It doesn't seem to be documented anywhere.  All I have is a 
few ad-hoc snippets of the file format to go off of:

<VTKFile type="Collection">
  <Collection>
    <DataSet timestep="0000" file="combined.0001.vtu"/>
    <DataSet timestep="0001" file="combined.0002.vtu"/>
    <DataSet timestep="0002" file="combined.0003.vtu"/>
    <DataSet timestep="0003" file="combined.0004.vtu"/>
    <DataSet timestep="0004" file="combined.0005.vtu"/>
    <DataSet timestep="0005" file="combined.0006.vtu"/>
    ...
    ...
  </Collection>
</VTKFile>

Is there any documentation available on this file format?  What I'm most 
interested in is doing non-unit timesteps so that I can produce an 
animation with Paraview with a timescale proportional to the real 
time-scale of the simulation.

Thanks for any advice!

Subject: [Paraview] Large Volumes and D3
Message-ID: <48A1A9AB.4040504@psc.edu>

It seems this should work: read 1 array from 1 HDF5 file then distribute it across nodes with D3.

The array is a simple volume of 2048^3, the data type is unsigned char and the file is 8GB. Its about as simple as it gets!

ParaView crashes when I use D3. Before it crashed the total memory usage for pvserver (i.e., the sum across all 4 nodes) climb to more than 72 GB (virtual) and 40 GB (resident). And I had not yet done any visualization.

ParaView CVS 6/25/2008
CentOS 5
4 nodes
each node has 16 GB and two quad Xeons (x86_64)
pvserver using 4 processes, one per node
HDF5_ENABLE_PARALLEL:BOOL=OFF

It seems there is a fatal design flaw that shows up when working with a large volume. Comments?

Hi Mark,

Can you capture these use cases in the bug tracker? I have some ideas
about how deal with them but I need to think more and I don't have
time right now.

Hi Dan,
   You can just use a real value for the timestep.
Here is a sniped of one of my pvd files. "part" can be used to specify  
multiple parts of a mesh for a given time  step.
For instance I use this to write out data from separate processes in a  
given time step in a mpi job.

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<VTKFile type="Collection" version="0.1" byte_order="LittleEndian">
<Collection>
<DataSet timestep="296.8545" group="" part="0"  
file="rns157_Natfreq_slc01_Vtp_nid0000_fld0122.vtu"/>
<DataSet timestep="300.1596" group="" part="0"  
file="rns157_Natfreq_slc01_Vtp_nid0000_fld0123.vtu"/>
<DataSet timestep="303.7438" group="" part="0"  
file="rns157_Natfreq_slc01_Vtp_nid0000_fld0124.vtu"/>

I've rebuilt Paraview from source using makefiles and built my plugin against it.  It worked and had the files in the correct directory.  It must just have been a configuration error in XCode.

Nope.  Sorry.  D3 wasn't designed to do that.  D3 assumes it is working with unstructured data, so it will be converting your nice 3D array into a bunch of unstructured hexahedra, which requires 576 GB in topology information and 192 GB in coordinate information alone.

D3 does not handle structured data because it is assumed that structured data will already be partitioned well.  It is typically the responsibility of the reader to respond to extent requests correctly.  The best case scenario is for the reader to use parallel HDF5 to concurrently read the volume and divide it amongst processes.

Hello again,

I've tried to make a drop-down gadget on my reader's properties panel both using the 3.2.2 and last Thursday's CVS release.  Is there a bugfix in the works for the EnumerationDomain tag on the IntVectorProperty?

Hmm. That's weird. I am not seeing this. Are you building with
VTK_USE_RPATH off? For some reason I haven't tracked down, some
installation targets do not work unless VTK_USE_RPATH is off. This is
not an issue for release versions (even versions) because we force it
to be off but it is an issue for development versions (odd versions)
because the default it RPATH on. This is on my list of things to track
down.

This definitely sounds like a bug. Can you verify that it is still hapening?

Can you be a bit more specific? Are you using the auto generated panels 
or creating one yourself? Can you provide the XML for the reader?

To be specific, the default gadget produced by the Enumeration Domain on my reader is a regular integer text-entry gadget with no range check at all.  According to Page 267-268 in the Paraview Guide (version 3), the Enumeration Domain is supposed to be a helper domain of IntVectorProperty and according to the text at the second paragraph of the Paraview Guide on page 281, the preferred way to implement a drop-down gadget is to replace the IntRangeDomain with an EnumerationDomain instead of creating a custom panel.

Is my (attached) XML wrong?

Domains should be assigned name. Try assigning name="enum" on all your 
enumeration domains. Generally speaking, it's not recommended to name 
domains arbitrarily (although this should be fixed in ParaView 
eventually). Try to stick with the names assigned to each type of domain 
  in ParaView's default configuration xmls 
(Servers/ServerManager/Resources/*.xml)

Subject: [Paraview] Will using RPath interfere with CPack on a Mac?
Message-ID: <494617.32519.qm@web59515.mail.ac4.yahoo.com>

I remember seeing a note somewhere in the ParaView build files that there was a problem associated with installation of dynamic libraries that were installed using RPath.  Does that mean that I can't distribute my reader plugins using CPack without having to manually execute install_name_tool -change on all of the library dependencies internally used by the reader .dylib files?

What I'm trying to do is make my readers work on user systems that have a binary install of ParaView on them.  I'd like to use CPack to generate a .dmg file for the readers as a package.

Ah, yes.  I think this is the third time I've asked this.  I'll try to 
remember in the future.  Problem is, I'm going to need rpath on in the 
build.  Indeed:

$ paraview
/usr/lib64/paraview/paraview-real: symbol lookup error: 
/usr/lib64/paraview/libpqCore.so: undefined symbol: 
_ZN11QFormLayout16staticMetaObjectE
[orion at test ~]$ ldd /usr/lib64/paraview/paraview-real
         linux-vdso.so.1 =>  (0x00007fffa79fe000)
         libpqComponents.so => not found
         libQtPython.so => not found
         libpqCore.so => not found
....

and so on.

I need to install libs in /usr/lib64/paraview and 
/usr/lib64/paraview-mpi to keep the mpi and non-mpi versions separate.

I think I'll have the Mac version install in the Paraview package itself so that the developer releases will automatically scan for them on startup.

Likewise I think I'll have the Windows version install in the same directory as the Paraview executable.  That's another discussion though.

I had hacked into paraview (and submitted a bug/feature request) to  
have Paraview look in more places for plugins. I think I have mine  
looking at the same level as the paraview.app and also in ~/Library/ 
Application Support/ParaView/Plugins  .. or something like that.
   This is a good reason for adding those locations. Usually 3rd  
party installers should NOT be installing plugins directly into  
a .app package which is what Samuel basically wants to do.

Subject: [Paraview] Problem: Apply Transformation Filter in pypatch
Message-ID: <48A3F212.9070409@gmx.de>

Hello everybody,

I'm really a paraview newbie so please excuse my simple questions.

I want to run paraview with python batch mode to perform off-screen
post-processing. That's why I include the servermanger python module in
the following python script:

#!/usr/bin/python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*

import sys
sys.path.insert(0 ,"/usr/lib/paraview-3.3")
from paraview import servermanager

sm=servermanager
sm.Connect()

#create simple cone
cone = sm.sources.ConeSource()

#create transform filter
transF = sm.filters.TransformFilter( Input = cone)

#debug
print transF.Transform
print type(transF.Transform)

Actually the transform filter  doesn't d o anything  since  the
proxyProperty transF.Transform has no value.
I tried to set a sm.vtk.vtkTransform -object  to  the  transF.Transform
Property but unfortunately it does not work:

>>> trafo = sm.vtk.vtkTransform()
>>> transF.Transform = trafo
Traceback (innermost last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "/usr/lib/paraview-3.3/paraview/servermanager.py", line 1503, in
setProperty
    return self.SetPropertyWithName(propName, value)
  File "/usr/lib/paraview-3.3/paraview/servermanager.py", line 163, in
SetPropertyWithName
    prop.SetData(arg)
  File "/usr/lib/paraview-3.3/paraview/servermanager.py", line 487, in
SetData
    self.SMProperty.AddProxy(value_proxy)
TypeError: function takes exactly 2 arguments (1 given)

I guess the types  of  both  objects do not match.

Maybe anybody knows how to set an appropriate transform value to the
TransformFilter's Property Transform.

Thanks a lot  for  your attention, Tobias

I think you will have to run install_name_tool. I can't think of
another way of making your libraries find the paraview libraries. We
discussed in the past installing the ParaView libraries as a
framework. That would fix your issue but would require more than a
drag and drop on the user part to install ParaView.

Mike,

The easist thing to do would be to submit a patch too. We try to
support Mac well but it is not always on the top of our priority list.
The class that needs changing is pqPluginManager, I believe. Please
keep in mind that the server loads plugins too. The
~/Library/Application Support/... would only work for client side
plugins unless the server is a Mac too.

Would it be possible to make a custom build of Paraview with the plugins built in so that my coworkers could just download it from the network and unpack it to somewhere and run it?

Sure. Compile ParaView (make sure that RPATH is on).
Run Applications/Client/CreateBundle.sh in your build tree which will
hopefully create a bundle that works. Copy your plugins under (I think)
Contents/MacOS inside the bundle. Run install_name_tool to fix the paths of
your plugins.

Subject: [Paraview] [Xdmf] Xdmf time series loads as Multi-block Dataset

Eric

I just tried xdmf for the first time in a couple of weeks an yes. It's 
completely stuffed. I get a multiblock dataset with 800 blocks, each 
being one timestep - instead of a single (or possibly multi-block) 
dataset with time varying stuff.

I Can see looking at Jerry's changes on immediate probable cause, but 
I'd better read through the email he sent a few days/week back and 
review the changes. I see what Jerry has tried to do - create a 
multiblock xdmf structure and just fetch the correct grid when you 
request a timestep - thus giving us what we want. But there's a flaw in 
the logic when the actual output dataset is generated - so that it 
creates a multiblock one instead of the type givenm by the Nth (=time) 
dataset inside it when we are fetching a time step which is not composite.

I need this to work, so I'll be looking at it soon. Ig Jerry reads this 
before I fix it, then feel free to step in with the correct patch :)

Message-ID: <45d654b0808141126r7c564dd0pd5331d246626a746@mail.gmail.com>

Hi folks,
Some of the servermanager properties of Xdmf reader have names that do not
match the rest of ParaView. I would like to clean them up but this will
cause older ParaView python scripts to not work anymore. State files will
work fine because we have backwards compatibility layer. Does anyone have a
strong objections to this? If there is anyone with significant investment in
python scripts that use Xdmf, please speak up now.

Hi there.
I got the following error when I tried to connect to a pvserver:

ERROR: In ..\..\..\ParaView3.2.3\Servers\Common\vtkServerConnection.cxx,
line 351

vtkServerConnection (064F90A0): Server could failed to gather information.

I started pvserver with the command: mpirun -np 4 ./pvserver
--use-offscreen-rendering.


Does anyone have the same problem? How to solve it? Any help would be highly
appreciated. Thanks for your time in advance!

I have seen errors like these when the client and server have mismatching
versions. Can you verify that they are the same?

This does NOT work on my 10.4.11/Xcode 2.5 system. There are lots and  
lots of errors during that script and the paraview.app never gets  
created.

I do "make install", which is the way I _thought_ I was supposed to  
build the .app bundle.

"make install" will probably work in 3.4 but until then we are stuck with
the script. By the way, I make the paraview binaries using that same script
on Tiger. I think it makes some assumptions that may not work for you. How
does it fail? I cannot imagine it failing such that the bundle is not even
created. It is more likely that the bundle is incomplete if the script
fails. Note that the script is a hack and it does produce bunch of errors
that can be ignored.

I thought that "make install" just called that script internally.  It has been working on the stable release source.  Does the stable release do more that doesn't get done when invoking the script from the terminal?  Also, whether you do "make install" or invoke the script you have to be logged in as the administrator or neither of them will work.

I don't think make install calls the script (maybe it used). Make install
actually works but only installs unix-style command line executable and
associated libraries (pvbatch, pvserver etc.) I have been making 2 different
distributions: one for that .app, one for the command line tools. If anyone
has suggestions for doing it otherwise, please let me know.

This is on ParaView CVS from yesterday. I ran "make" then "sudo make  
install". After a _really_ long time and lots of "warnings" about Qt  
Frameworks that were NOT found ( I have Qt built as DyLibs), there is  
NO paraview.app in the installation location. Everything else got  
installed, even my own plugin and associated application. The  
paraview.app that is in the build directory is only 500K, so that  
isn't a complete application.

CMake 2.4.8 (Built on my machine)
OS X 10.4.11 (Intel)
Xcode 2.5 tooling.

Don't know what else to do. I guess I could blow away my source and  
build directories and start again?

I have arrays written out from C into HDF5 using the HDF5 C
API, and so in the file the arrays are in C ordering.  I now
need to read them into VTK.  AFAICT, VTK is Fortran ordering,
even though it is written in C++.  So that means I need to
reverse the ordering.  Of course, I can write a loop to do
this, but is there some standard way that VTK folks do this?
I don't want to reinvent the wheel.

Sorry for what is likely an elementary question, but I could
not find it on the FAQ or after googling quite a bit.

Thanks so much......John Cary

Depends what format you are talking about. Converting to legacy VTK, 
yes, this is inefficient in every regard. If you are knowledgable to 
program in hdf5 you may consider writing a plugin that will import your 
data without file conversions. However, you will probably have to 
convert rank-2 arrays anyway:

	// FIXME can it be done smarter
	for(int j=0; j<array->GetNumberOfTuples(); j++)
	{
		for(int i=0; i<array->GetNumberOfComponents(); i++)
		{
			array->SetComponent(j,i,data(j+1,i+1));
		}
	}

where data is a fortran style array. I wonder too if SetData would work 
here.

How are you creating this package? First creating an installation with the
default paths and then moving them? It looks like, by modifying one CMake
file, you can have ParaView generate the right sort of build AND set the
right forwarding path without worrying about RPATHs. In
CMake/ParaViewCommon.cmake, the forwarding path seems to be set here:
IF(NOT PV_INSTALL_LIB_DIR)
  SET(PV_INSTALL_LIB_DIR
${PV_INSTALL_ROOT}/lib/paraview-${PARAVIEW_VERSION})
ENDIF(NOT PV_INSTALL_LIB_DIR)

It sound like, if you change that to

IF(NOT PV_INSTALL_LIB_DIR)
  SET(PV_INSTALL_LIB_DIR
${PV_INSTALL_ROOT}/lib/paraview-${PARAVIEW_VERSION})-mpi
ENDIF(NOT PV_INSTALL_LIB_DIR)

everything should work. Of course, take my word with a pinch of salt since I
am only a novice when it comes to writing CMake files.

Is there any way to get a ParaView compile/install to generate a 'vtkpython'
binary that works like the one with classic VTK ?

I ask because it seems a bit excessive to have to compile VTK separately,
when it's included in PAraView. And I'm unable to build classic VTK objects
within pvpython.  Am I doing something wrong?

If you build ParaView from cvs, you will have what you want. We are
now wrapping the whole VTK to python as well as compile vtkpython.

Thanks for your response.  A few more questions.

Apologies for not knowing about legacy VTK.  Does this imply that the
newer VTK uses C ordering by default?  If so, in what version did it
change?

Thanks again.....John Cary

Below is basically what I do.  The binaries though need rpaths set to 
the appropriate /usr/lib[64]/paraview[-mpi] directory in order to work 
because they are not in the default linker path (and they can't be or 
you won't be able to switch between the two).

Something else is missing because the wrapper executables set
LD_LIBRARY_PATH before execing the xxx-real versions. As long as they
are getting the right xxx-real executable, they should have set the
right environment for execution. You cannot simply use ldd on
paraview-real to figure out if it is finding the right libraries. You
should use "paraview --ldd" instead.

You will need SetArray method from the concrete implementation of 
vtkDataArray. I could not quickly find in the source code any hints 
about the underlying storage ordering, but it is trivial to find out 
experimentally. Just post the results please. If it is the same as yours 
no copying is needed.

Ah crap, scratch those issues then, I think everything is fine then.  I 
was getting an unresolved symbol error and think it was because it 
wasn't able to find a library but it was because I had installed on a 
different version of Fedora.  Things look good.  Sorry about at this.

FYI, I built VTK and Paraview from cvs source yesterday on Mac OSX 10.5, but
I get different behavior with VTK's vtkpython and paraview's vtkpython. I
still don't have the frames around the windows when I use paraview's  vtk
python (all the calls to the vtk windows just pile up in the upper left-hand
corner of the screen and can't be moved). VTK's vtkpython gives me full
featured  windows. Do I just need  to be more  careful in configuring VTK
inside paraview? Is there a way to do a diff between the VTK configuration
files and Paraview's VTK configuration?  Just out of curiousity, what would
be involved in installing a working vtk module in my system python?

VTK uses Fortran ordering for structured datasets (vtkImageData,
vtkStructuredPoints, vtkStructuredGrid, vtkRectilinearGrid and
vtkUniformGrid). If (i, j, k) are the indices of a structured
datasets, arrays are stored such that i increases the fastest, then j,
then k. The tricky part is when you have arrays of multiple components
(for example vectors or tensors). You can treat a vector an array of
dimensions (3, Ni, Nj, Nk) where the component index increases the
fastest, then i, then j, then k. It would have been probably more
logical to use C ordering and store arrays as (Ni, Nj, Nk,
Ncomponents) but it is not done that way. I am guessing the original
developers of VTK like writing their loops like:

for (k=0; k<Nk; k++)
 for (j=0; j<Nj; j++)
  for (i=0; j<Ni; i++)
   for (comp=0; comp<Ncomponents; comp++)
     index = comp + i*Ncomponents + j*Ni*NComponents + k*Nj*Ni*NComponents

Nothing to be sorry about. But if you really want to pay for your
crimes, you can write a page about this on the ParaView wiki :-)

My guess is that this happens because, by default, VTK is compiled
with Cocoa whereas ParaView is compiled with Carbon. It has to be this
way for now because Qt is based on Carbon. It will change when Qt is
over Cocoa.

  Hi

  I was explaining paraview to a coleague when I found out (ver. 3.2.3, 
install from debian package) that when saving screenshot he no longer asks 
for the output resolution :| How can I explicit this? I need high-res

Well, I was unable to figure out how to get hdf5 to read the data
in by Fortran order, so I wrote the snippet below.  Sending by
request.

This is probably slow, so better solutions always welcome.

Hi,
Is it possible to execute Paraview from the command line and load a .pvs
file. I tried paraview.exe - -data=test.pvs which returned the "cannot
find reader" error dialog. I can load a vtk format data file in this
manner.  
Cheers,
Rob

There is no other way of reading C arrays into Fortran ordering than 
ordering conversion, but it can be implemented optimally as an in-place 
transpose (once already in memory) on the reader side. This costs time, 
not storage. I so much hoped this would be a feature of xdmf2 for 
example, it is one in my own home grown hdf5 Paraview reader. --DS

So I guess what I could do is reorder my data pointer array, then set 
the pointer
of vtkDataArray to my pointer?

And I should be able to transpose by just swapping the fortran index
and C index locations, but then I have to figure out how to do it
just once.

That is what I suggest to try if you care about optimal performance.

well yes, you will have to "touch" the original data and need to 
transpose it back if necessary and when not anymore needed by VTK 
(remember that with SetArray it will be referenced). Alternatively, you 
can do inverse on a copy, if storage is no issue.

Message-ID: <001b01c900f4$a4590f10$6701a8c0@THINKPADT43>


I'm attempting to use Paraview for the first time, and trying to get a feel
for it by reading in a simple sample data set.
However the results are not as I expect and I'm wondering if someone could
give me some idea of what I am doing wrong.
I'm using version 2.4, release 4 from the CD that comes with the VTK Users
Guide (VTK 5.0.4) on Windows 2000.
My data file is appended below.

red, z=1 as green and z=2 as blue.
What I actually see is the points at z=1 being blue (z=0 and z=2 are red and
blue respectively).

If I use a probe to look at the data, those at z=1 seem to have a value of 1
as I expect.

If I change the Representation to Surface then the sides of the cube have
the colours
0<red<0.33
0.33<green<0.66
0.66<blue<2

Also, if I display the Scalar Bar and set its Resolution property to 3 then
I get a Scalar Bar showing
0<blue<0.66<green<1.33<red<2.
This is the reverse of the lookup table that I have read in.

So several questions:
1. Why when viewed as points are those at z=1 not green?
2. Why when viewed as a Surface do I get the colors described above?
3. Why does the Scalar Bar have the colours reversed (from what I expect)?

Much appreciated
Phil.

Or you can try the paraview in Debian, we compiled it with ffmpeg. If
something doesn't work, please report a bug.

Thanks. If you have a little time, we would be interested in any
collaboration on the paraview package in Debian, e.g. uploading it to
backports or anything, so that it's officially supported on etch too.

All,

I was out all of last week so I'm in catch up mode ....

I was making significant changes to the XDMF reader and they are not
finished yet. I checked in the changes that made the spatial collection
of temporal collections work. The issue was that the reader was assuming
that a temporal collection was at the first level (which may be the most
common case).

As I recall (it will take me a few hours to get back into the code) the 
changes that I made now treat spatial and temporal collections similarly
no matter the level. There's an internal flag to mark the temporal
collections.
That's why there is a big multiblock dataset for temporal collections.

The code to now make the output of a temporal collection the same type
as the children (and not a multiblock) is not yet working. Hopefully I
can get back to it today after fighting some other fires.

The main problem I was dealing with (other than the above temporal
collection
multiblock issue) was getting the reader to work correctly in parallel
when
the collection was not at the top level, i.e. not duplicating reads.

	I just tried xdmf for the first time in a couple of weeks an
yes. It's 
	completely stuffed. I get a multiblock dataset with 800 blocks,
each 
	being one timestep - instead of a single (or possibly
multi-block) 
	dataset with time varying stuff.
	
	I Can see looking at Jerry's changes on immediate probable
cause, but 
	I'd better read through the email he sent a few days/week back
and 
	review the changes. I see what Jerry has tried to do - create a 
	multiblock xdmf structure and just fetch the correct grid when
you 
	request a timestep - thus giving us what we want. But there's a
flaw in 
	the logic when the actual output dataset is generated - so that
it 
	creates a multiblock one instead of the type givenm by the Nth
(=time) 
	dataset inside it when we are fetching a time step which is not
composite.
	
	I need this to work, so I'll be looking at it soon. Ig Jerry
reads this 
	before I fix it, then feel free to step in with the correct
patch :)

		Hey all,
		
		Maybe I'm behind on my Xdmf XML format again, but my
files that a  
		month or two ago loaded a time series of unstructured
grids now loads  
		into ParaView CVS as a Multi-block Dataset with one
block for each  
		time step at each time point.
		
		Let's say I have 1200 Polyvertex time steps in my file.
I can (slowly)  
		step through the animation of my grid, but at each time
point the  
		progress bar is cycling through a bunch of work, and
each time point  
		lists (in the Information tab Data Hierarchy pane) a
Multi-block  
		Dataset made up of 1200 Unstructured Grids. Clicking on
each of these  
		blocks reveals that only the "current" time step block
has Data Arrays  
		associated with the grid. So, at each time step of the
animation, the  
		process seems very slow because 1200 blocks are being
loaded, only one  
		of which actually has real data in it. (The Time pane at
the bottom of  
		the Information tab always lists the correct time
indices and values  
		for the whole series.)
		
		Maybe this is just a change in the way time series are
dealt with, but  
		it is much slower with my data sets, and it made more
sense to me to  
		have each time step able to be represented as a simple
grid, if  
		desired. (I have been using a self-modified
vtkXdmfReader.cxx file for  
		a while, so I'm not sure when this multi-block issue
would have  
		appeared.)
		
		Thanks,
		-Eric

First, let me recommend that you update your version of ParaView (which you can download from www.paraview.org).  Version 2.4 was released several years ago and is no longer supported.

That said, I see that the behavior you describe also exists in the latest released version (3.2).  It looks like the data file is defining a lookup table with a domain from 0 to 1.  You can fix the problem by simply not defining a lookup table for the data in the file.  Change the line "LOOKUP_TABLE lut" to "LOOKUP_TABLE default" and the ParaView lookup table will be used as expected.  You can also delete the entire LOOKUP_TABLE section at the bottom of the file.

Why the lookup table defined in the file is scaling from 0 to 1 and how to get past that, I don't know.  Personally, I don't use this feature and don't recommend it to any ParaView users because it has dubious value and usually leads to confusing results (as you have just found).  If you really care about this feature, you should bring it up with the vtkusers list.

Further to my email the other day. Putting the commented line back in, 
did 'appear' to fix my temporal problem, but on closer inspection, 
although the time steps were correct, the data inside them was missing. 
Inspector showed no cells, points etc.

I reverted my own copy back a couple of revisions so that I could work 
with my own data. I await further developments, but am available (this 
week) for help/testing if need be

cheers

There is no direct way to print from within ParaView.  However, you can save a snapshot of the screen to a variety of formats including pdf.  Just go to File -> Save Screenshot.  From there you should find it easy to print the image.

John,

Thanks.. Once I get this working it'll need a lot of testing.

If I read you correctly then you're saying that using (or at least loading)
a custom color map is not recommended as it may lead to unexpected results.
That seems strange for a visualization package.

That being said, I have upgraded to the latest version, and the default
lookup table is fine for my initial purposes.

Thanks
Phil.

Subject: [Paraview] Rotational geometric repetition in paraview (python)
Message-ID: <48A9977B.3060509@gmx.de>

Hello,

I'd like to create a geometric repetition of a computational domain with 
paraview. Solving this issue using the GUI of paraview ain't  a problem 
since I use the Transform-Filter. Because the geometric repetition of 
the grid and the solution is of circumferential kind I use a rotational 
transformation on multiple copies of the domain.
I tried to adopt this strategy although using the python 
servermanager-modul but unfortunately I can't use the transform-filter 
in the same way. (Actually I am unsure how to allocate a certain 
transformation to the transform-filter.)

Maybe somebody knows an alternative solution for such kind of problems. 
Any suggestion would be very helpful for me.

Thanks, Tobias.

OK, the reader now produces uniform grids for temporal collections.
I'm still testing but I've checked in the new version.
Please give it a try on a variety of cases.

Thanks
Jerry

Hi there.
I successfully installed paraview with MPI support and managed to connect to
the server. But the speed is strangely slow.
I got the following two types of errors, I am wondering if these are the
reasons for a slow speed:

1. xlib: extension "XFree86-DRI" missing on display "HostMachineIP".
2. pvserver(5037): unaligned access to Ox60000000024e54oc, ip =
ox2000000003568e0

Thanks for your help!

When you say speed, I assume you are referring to rendering speed.  It sounds like there might be a problem with the X servers on your server machine.  Verify that you can properly create OpenGL X windows on each of the nodes of your server.  See the ParaView wiki for more information.

  http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Setting_up_a_ParaView_Server#X_Connections

If your server does not have rendering hardware, then use OSMesa and circumvent the whole X windows issues altogether (details of that are on the Wiki as well).

Apart from moving it around with the mouse, not directly through the GUI.  There might be a way to set the location/size through Python scripting.

Subject: [Paraview] questions about writing a parallel reader
Message-ID: <20080820.000846.195059041.oshima@eng.niigata-u.ac.jp>

Hi,

I am now modifying my reader to work in parallel and managed to get
its preliminary version to work, using vtkPExodusIIReader and Section
21.3 "Parallel Readers" of the ParaView Guide as references. However I
am still somewhat uncertain about its implementation details and have
several questions:

1. What is the differences between
  outInfo->Get(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_PIECES())
and
  vtkMultiProcessController::GetNumberOfProcesses()?
Similarly, what is the difference between
  outInfo->Get(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_PIECE_NUMBER())
and
  vtkMultiProcessController::GetLocalPricessId()?
Is it safe to assume that they return the same values respectively?

2. How do property changes on GUI propagate to each reader thread?
Are they supposed to propagate to all threads, or only one thread,
e. g. the thread where UPDATE_PIECE_NUMBER is 0?

3. How can I update the progress bar at the bottom of the GUI?
Sometimes UpdateProgress() works but sometimes not. What is the
supposed way of doing it? Again, can I assume that the standard way is
to update it from the thread where UPDATE_PIECE_NUMBER is 0?

Thanks,
Takuya

GetNumberOfProcesses gives you the true number of MPI spawned processes. 
This is usually the same as UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_PIECES, but not 
necessarily. The UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_PIECES culd be less, due to the way 
data is split (the reader can say, max num pices is N - you may have 
some data that cannot be easily split). The UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_PIECES is 
passed in during processRequest, and set by the downstream pipeline, the 
GetNumberOf... is always present.

they nearly always do. Same discussion as above.

All processes get the information, passed up/down the pipeline. Thread 
(process) 0 is special in that stuff that you set gets copied from here 
to the gui, but generally, all processes will be generating the same 
stuff, apart form extent/piece information

Inside ProcessRequest, you use the standard  UpdateProgress calls and 
the gui will do the rest. If it's not working, have a look at other 
reader which you know do work.

Hey Guys,

Thanks for the fixes, Jerry! It's working for most of my cases now  
(temporal collections of Polyvertex and Polygon grids). Also, for the  
first time, I can now load a saved state file in Python and do an  
animation with Xdmf files! I don't know if this got fixed with these  
recent changes, but with older versions of the reader I was never able  
to do that.

The only variant that is not bringing in data correctly is when I have  
a temporal collection which contains a 3dCoRecMesh grid at each time  
point. If I can't find a problem with my files in the next day or two,  
I'll try to cook up a small example that reproduces the behavior.

Thanks again,
-Eric

I've built Paraview from last Wednesday's CVS and the CVS from the Thursday before that.  On the Mac I get a linker error:  Undefined Symbols:  "vtkIntantiatorvtkDistanceFilterNew()", refrerenced from: __Z35vtkInstantiaqtorvtkDistanceFilterNewv$non_lazy_ptr in vtkSMDistanceFilterInstantiator.cxx.o

I can't build the CVS of ParaView on Windows because I don't have 4.3.x of QT and IIRC TrollTech's downloads for Windows go back as far as 4.4.0 of QT.

The filter builds fine under the stable releases on both Windows and Mac.  The readers build fine on all of the above.

vtkDistanceFilter?  I don't see that in my source list.  Do you have a modified source build?

At any rate, I would try doing a clean build.  Run CMake from scratch to an empty binary directory and build everything over again.  I find that often solves problems of this nature.

You can get previous version of Qt from this Trolltech ftp site:

  ftp://ftp.trolltech.com/qt/source/

There is a link on the Qt download page, but it is easy to miss.

Also, you could try to compile ParaView with Qt 4.4.0 by removing the check in the CMake files (ParaView3/CMakeLists.txt lines 91-95).  We discourage users from using the new early version so that we don't have to worry about issues with different version of Qt, but to my knowledge no one has found any problems.

Pathlines can be represented as lines in polygonal data.  There are multiple formats that support polygonal data, but if you are starting from scratch, the legacy VTK data format with a POLYDATA type of DATASET is probably the path of least resistant.  Documentation for the legacy VTK format can be found at:

I think what Ken is recommending against using the color map defined
in a VTK file. ParaView has its own way of loading custom color maps
defined as XML files.

The UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_PIECES culd be less, due to the way data is split (the reader can say, max num pices is N - you may have some data that cannot be easily split). The UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_PIECES is passed in during processRequest, and set by the downstream pipeline, the GetNumberOf... is always present.

Subject: [Paraview] problem opening binary vtk: Paraview LINUX version 32 or
	64	bit?
Message-ID: <48AC031402000066000944A7@gwiasmtp.uct.ac.za>

22, August 2008

Hi, I had a question about writing a binary vtk file and then opening it in Paraview.

When I write it in ASCII format it works. When I write it out in binary format, it doesn't.
And I'm following the file format pdf for vtk (version 4.2). I'm writing in C on a 64-bit LINUX
machine (Open Suse).

I know the file format pdf says to watch out for Big Endian/Little Endian and integer-size (32bit vs 64 bit)
problems. But I thought there should be no problem since I have Paraview for LINUX x86
and assumed it was the correct bit-version.

So I don't think it's a Big Endian/Little Endian problem. But I did notice that Paraview only offers
one LINUX version download. Does anyone know if it is a 32 bit version or a 64 bit version?
Or does anyone have a different solution?

Thanks.

Gentleness,
Victor

Same for me. I only have 3DCORECTMESH types and none of my data loads. 
Time is good, but geometry is lost.

ImageData is the only datatype afaik that paraview takes all 
origin/spacing/extent information directly from the information object 
attached to the data, rather than the data itself. I suspect that the 
information being set insiside RequestGridInformation in the xdmf 
reader, is being set on the grid's individual information, object, but 
not being copied into the output information. I'm looking into it.

John, Eric,

Yes, I duplicated the problem here and it seems that the information is
not being set correctly. John, you probably understand this much better
that I do. 

I'm guessing it has to do with the OutputVtkType being set to image data
but the vtkXdmfReaderGrid is actually a collection : isCollection = 1
and
isTemporal = 1.

That worked on the ones that I've tried !!
I tried it on spatial and temporal collections of 3DCoRectMesh.

I changed some of the code to try to make parallel reads work
on collections at any level. It works on the examples I tried.
Has anyone tried parallel pvserver on their data ?

Subject: [Paraview] November Training Course
Message-ID: <48AC56CD.90001@kitware.com>

Kitware is pleased to announce the next Developer's Training Week for VTK, ITK, ParaView and CMake, which will be held November 3-6, 2008 in Clifton Park, NY. Course details are provided below and online at http://www.kitware.com/products/protraining.html. Early Registration ends September 30th. Please contact courses at kitware.com with any questions.


Details
----------

The Developer's Training Week will cover our open-source projects including VTK, ITK, ParaView and CMake. These hands-on courses are appropriate for both new users wishing to quickly gain proficiency and experienced developers requiring advanced customization skills. The Developer?s Training Week is a great opportunity to meet some of the key contributors to these open-source projects as well as other users in the open source community.

The course runs Monday through Thursday, from 9am to 5pm. The course schedule is:

Software Overview: Monday AM
This session provides an introduction to VTK, ITK, ParaView, and CMake, and an overview of the open source communities, products, and services that support these projects.

VTK Track 1: Monday PM through Tuesday PM
Targeted for beginners, this session provides a basic understanding of the VTK pipeline mechanism and the rendering subsystem. Attendees are led through detailed examples to quickly gain a working knowledge of the visualization and data processing capabilities of VTK for various data types.

VTK Track 2: Monday PM through Tuesday PM
This session covers advanced topics in VTK including custom filter writing, information visualization, multi-block and composite data handling, time support, interaction and widgets, and parallel data processing.

CMake / CDash / CTest: Wednesday AM
Learn how you can use the open-source software process tools employed by VTK, ITK, and ParaView in order to quickly and easily build and test your own software projects in a heterogeneous computing environment.

ITK: Wednesday PM through Thursday PM
This session covers the basic architecture of ITK, the use of its image segmentation and image registration algorithms, the methods used for interfacing ITK to VTK, and the common techniques for integrating ITK into existing applications.

ParaView: Wednesday PM through Thursday PM
The first part of this session offers an introduction to ParaView from a user's perspective, providing you with the knowledge necessary to effectively process and visualize your data. The second part of the course is geared toward developers who would like to create custom functionality and incorporate it into ParaView.

As a course attendee, you will receive:
- Books / course notes for the sessions you attend
- Snacks and lunch daily
- A dinner reception on both Monday and Wednesday evening

The Registration Fees for the Developer's Training Week are:

On or before September 30th:
- $2500 for the four days or
- $750 per day

After September 30th:
- $3000 for the four days or
- $900 per day

No prior experience is necessary; however, attendees will need to have basic knowledge of C or C++ in order to fully participate in the interactive exercises.

Kitware courses incorporate both technical presentations and practical exercises designed to reinforce learning. Each attendee should bring their own laptop computer to the courses. Approximately two weeks before the course, attendees will receive detailed instructions on how to download, install and test all necessary software on their laptop computer. Any remaining issues will be resolved on-site during the Software Overview session on Monday morning.

The course registration form can be found at http://www.kitware.com/products/protraining.html. Additional information is available by emailing courses at kitware.com or by calling 518-371-3971.

Message-ID: <alpine.DEB.0.82.0808201140330.15405@memphis.cs.utah.edu>

Here's how to duplicate this condition:

1. Start with an empty scene.
2. Create a primitive shape, i.e. Sources -> Cone
3. Click the "Apply" button in the Properties tab of the Object Inspector.
4. Click either the Display or Information tab in the Object Inspector.
5. Click the "Undo" button on the toolbar (or Ctrl-Z).
6. ParaView crashes, with an output message of:
"""

Hi,

I got a leak from vtkCommunicator::Broadcast(vtkDataArray *, int)
detected by the "leaks" tool on OS X. It looks like it's because the
delete operator at line 1004 of vtkCommunicator.cxx is enclosed by "if
(nameLength > 0)," while the new operator at line 984 is not (the leak
disappears if I set a name for the vtkDataArray).

Regards,
Takuya

If you have trouble, just delete everything and untar the source again to start fresh.

All legacy VTK fies (.vtk) have to be big endian (which means you have
to swap bytes when writing from Linux even if you are going to read
from Linux) and with 32 bit integers for long arrays.

Thanks, it did fix the problem. Indeed, zero-byte allocation does not
necessarily return a null pointer. I got a leak also on Linux from
this test program

Subject: [Paraview] Two leaks from vtkPVPluginLoader.cxx
Message-ID: <20080825.115049.31757875.oshima@eng.niigata-u.ac.jp>

Hi,

This time I got two leaks from vtkPVPluginLoader.cxx. What is attached
below is the log from Apple's leaks tool. I guess the first one occurs
because the if-block at lines 97-100 prevents the allocated string to
be released when this->SetFileName(0) is called in the destructor. The
second one is because the string allocated by vtkSetStringMacro(Error)
is not released at the destruction of the object. Just guesses and not
confirmed, though.

Regards,
Takuya

But it's fixed now, right? Or is this another leak that you are reporting
now...?

Hi,

The leak from vtkCommunicator::Broadcast(vtkDataArray *, int) which I
reported last Friday was confirmed to have been fixed, but I'm having
yet other leaks from vtkPVPluginLoader.cxx as reported today in the mail
titled "Two leaks from vtkPVPluginLoader.cxx."

In fact Apple's "leaks" reports yet more leaks. I'm only reporting
what seems to be surely coming from ParaView itself.

Subject: [Paraview] How can I tell that Allocate succeeded?
In-Reply-To: <48B06EDE.1060808@txcorp.com>

Hi John,

If the call to Allocate fails it will not return. If VTK/Paraview has 
been built in Release mode, then a "vtkstd::bad_alloc()" exception is 
thrown  when the Allocate call fails. Otherwise, if VTK/Paraview has 
been built in Debug mode, abort is called. This behavior comes from 
within VTK, and was implemented a couple months ago, so you may need to 
have the cvs version.

Subject: [Paraview] vtkContourFilter generates two contours when requesting
	only one
Message-ID: <497fe5210808250749m31b826cfif35046496e98108c@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I'm using Paraview off cvs somewhere between 3.3 and the latest head.

I have an Image (Uniform Rectilinear Grid) of 334170 cells and 349600
points. I have a point Data Array called "Distance" which was obtained using
a surface reconstruction algorithm. I ran the Filters->Common->Contour on
the Image Data and asked for an Isosurface at value 0 for "Distance".

The output I get is both that contour that looks correct at distance 0, and
a second contour that is decidedly less accurate (very blocky looking) that
'wraps' the correct contour. In other cases I have had the opposite happen,
that is, the correct contour wraps the less accurate contour.

Is this the intended output? I expected to only receive one contour if I
only put in one value for Isosurface.

Thank You,

I don't recall ever seeing anything of that nature with the contour filter.  Perhaps something is going wrong with the surface reconstruction algorithm.  I have not played with it a lot, but the artifacts you describe sound like those that could be generated if the surface reconstruction does not generate consistent normals.

It might be helpful to see your data.  Is there any way you could post it?

Good call, my bad.

We've been working on repairing vtkSurfaceReconstruction for use in our
ParaViewGeo product. I accidentally put positive values on the 'negative
side' of the surface reconstruction grid, so the contour filter saw two zero
contours.

Sorry for the confusion!

Subject: [Paraview] Can sources use filenames in property panels?
Message-ID: <436675.67978.qm@web59505.mail.ac4.yahoo.com>

Hello again,

I'm trying to make a source that can read in two files and generate output based on those files and a few other selection boxes on the panel describing the file processing.  I cannot use file readers for the two files because there are already readers registered to both file types and they produce inappropriate data conversions for the type of data processing I have to do on the files.  As such, I also cannot use a filter to process the input files due to that fact.

Whenever I try to make a string gadget on the source's properties panel it doesn't register on the sources menu.  When I comment out the FileListDomain from each of the filename gadgets, the string gadgets don't appear at all but the plugin registers as a source.  Whether I do or don't comment out the FileListDomain, everything compiles correctly and loads correctly under the CVS version of Paraview for Windows from last Wednesday.

How can I make a source that can read a file?

Subject: [Paraview] Vis template by changing reader file names?
Message-ID: <431061CA-0A16-40BA-A6B4-35FE2708613C@cs.duke.edu>

Hey All,

My group wants to use ParaView for debugging their simulation system,  
where they might output many different files in a day with tweaked  
parameters and want to quickly view the results to see whether things  
are changing the way they expect.

The problem is that for each run there are three different output  
(unstructured grid) files, and to make a nice visualization each has  
to be glyphed or colored or filtered in some special way. I can do  
this, and it looks great, but it takes a while to set up each time a  
new set of files is generated, so it's a bit of a pain.

Therefore, main question: Once a visualization pipeline is set up, is  
there any easy way to pick new files for the readers so new data could  
quickly be visualized using an existing "template"?

I have tried reading in new files and using the "Change Input..." menu  
item, but it's a bit of a pain because it's a multi-step method that  
changes the order of items in the Pipeline Browser each time you do  
it. I know how to save a state file and then edit the source file  
names for the readers, but this takes the user out of ParaView and is  
a little clunky, but do-able. I can also write a python script that  
loads a state file and changes the input files and creates an  
animation automatically, but that isn't as flexible as looking at the  
data in ParaView itself. (I also tried to change a source file name  
from the Python shell within ParaView, but at least with an Xdmf file,  
that always crashes ParaView when I'm driving...)

Am I missing something clean and easy? Is this a typical thing people  
would want to routinely do with ParaView?

Thanks,
-Eric

Hey again,

Okay, I just saw a partial answer on the ParaView FAQ "Why can't I  
change the filename on my reader?".

If other people have a similar situation, though, with trying to set  
up and change files using a "template" for a more complicated,  
multiple-file visualization, I'd appreciate it if you could share your  
techniques for making this as easy as possible for the user.

Thanks,
-Eric

Message-ID: <c5ab7e340808251305h5ae041ebw2bc261992fb833cf@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

We have a cluster running 64-bit RedHat 5, and I'm trying to set up
ParaView on it.  I first ran ccmake without specifying any MPI
parameters (other than PARAVIEW_USE_MPI OFF) and it built without any
problems. I then deleted by build directory to ensure a clean build
and set up ccmake using the following:

 BUILD_SHARED_LIBS                ON
 CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE
 CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX             /opt/paraview/3.2.3
 MPI_EXTRA_LIBRARY                /usr/mpi/gcc/openmpi-1.2.6/lib64/libmpi_cxx.so
 MPI_INCLUDE_PATH                 /usr/mpi/gcc/openmpi-1.2.6/include
 MPI_LIBRARY                      /usr/mpi/gcc/openmpi-1.2.6/lib64/libmpi.so
 PARAVIEW_BUILD_QT_GUI            ON
 PARAVIEW_DATA_ROOT               PARAVIEW_DATA_ROOT-NOTFOUND
 PARAVIEW_ENABLE_PYTHON           ON
 PARAVIEW_USE_MPI                 ON
 QT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE              /usr/lib64/qt4/bin/qmake
 VTK_NO_PYTHON_THREADS            OFF
 VTK_USE_BOOST                    OFF
 VTK_USE_FFMPEG_ENCODER           OFF
 VTK_USE_METAIO                   ON
 VTK_USE_RPATH                    OFF
 VTK_USE_VIEWS                    ON

After generating the makefile and running make it gets about 80% of
the way through the build and then it dies with the following error:

/home/brucep/paraview-bin/bin/vtkSMExtractDocumentation-real: error
while loading shared libraries: libmpi_cxx.so.0: cannot open shared
object file: No such file or directory
make[2]: *** [Documentation/ParaViewSources.html] Error 127
make[1]: *** [Servers/ServerManager/CMakeFiles/HTMLDocumentation.dir/all]
Error 2

Why is it complaining that it can't find libmpi_cxx.so.0 when I have
the full path to it specified in MPI_EXTRA_LIBRARY?  I've
triple-checked that the path is correct. but I always get errors that
it can't be found.

Have you tried putting your pipeline into a custom filters?
Select all the filters you want included, then create the custom filter from 
the group using the menu item  Tools -> Create Custom Filter...

To use it, just open your file and apply the one filter.

Hello Bruce,

Did you try clearing the cache in CMake?  Sometimes it complains needlessly when it has residual cache information from a previous build.

Hello Eric
?
Oh yes, what you describe appears to be a typical thing. I have tried
all the options you mentioned. The last one is the only reliable and
automated way I have found. I do change the reader's Filename from
inside the python shell. I use our own in-house readers and I do not
have the crashes you experience. So this should be a motivation for you
to try again. It ought to work fine.
?
I have it documented for our users in these notes.
https://www-users.cscs.ch/resources/hp/docs/PvPython.pdf

Some of it is specific to our servers, but the logic stays the same.

Hey Clint,

Yes, that's a great idea (which I've tried briefly, but haven't used  
much yet) for speeding up the process of setting it up from scratch  
each time. Is there an easy way of sharing custom filters, so that if  
I create some vis elements and combine them in custom filters, I could  
send them to the others in my research group so they could use the  
same parameters?

I guess I was hoping there would be an easy way to change files "in  
place" after a pipeline had been set up (or a state file loaded), but  
I can see how that could cause problems if people choose the wrong  
file type.

Thanks,
-Eric

Tools -> Manage Custom Filters ...  gives you an import and export option to 
share your custom filters with others.

I just committed a change in CVS to help you.
Put back your FileListDomain in your properties.
But add an XML hint to show the properties in the panel.
The fix I put in puts it in the sources menu if the show hint is there.

<SourceProxy ....>
   .....
     <Hints>
       <Property name="FileName" show="1"/>
     </Hints>
</SourceProxy>

Message-ID: <d0767b160808251537q26c4f0b2v8bcad1d46b30025d@mail.gmail.com>

Hi there.
I know that there are four different volume rendering algorithms in
Paraview: projected tetrahedra, HAVS, Bunyk Ray Casting and ZSweep.
My question is how can I choose a specific algorithm to render my own data?
Thanks very much for your time!

Message-ID: <alpine.DEB.0.82.0808251512560.2616@thebes.cs.utah.edu>

To duplicate:

1. Create any primitive object (i.e. Sources -> Cone) and Apply.
2. Split the view either horizontally or vertically.
3. With the new (blank) view selected, create another primitive object 
(i.e. Sources -> Cone) and Apply.
4. Click the Undo button; the view goes blank as expected.
5. Click the Redo button; the geometry is restored to the view, but the 
camera has now zoomed in significantly, making the object appear larger 
than before.

Interestingly, the unsolicited zoom only happens in a split view, not in a 
normal full-size view.

These results were obtained on Windows Vista, using a build of ParaView 
compiled in Visual Studio 2005, from the source tree checked out from CVS 
earlier today.

Thanks for any help you could offer,
Geoff

P.S. Thank you developers for your quick resolution to bug #7515!

and many more of that kind. As this is an example which came with the source code, shouldn?t it compile properly? I?d hate to change anything in the source code by myself.. 

Thanks for help,

PS: I know there should be a mailing list for Xdmf, but I?m just to stupid to find it!!!

Message-ID: <BAY122-W43B207672AFFCA00C1F6B6BC660@phx.gbl>


Hello!
I want to add a new Filter to Paraview, so I downloaded the source code with cvs and wrote two files concerning my new filter, one header- and one source file. Now I have to include it into Paraview, so here my question:
Which files do I have to alterate to get the filter included? I suppose I have to write a kind of Filter-Panel, for the GUI, but I did not find anything similar for already included filters.. 

thx for your help,
Natalie Happenhofer

Hello,

It seems that at present Paraview 3.2.3 supports only the "Loop

Hi,

Assuming your filter is written in such a way that is compatible with 
VTK's pipeline, you have a couple of options, I am going to explain what 
I believe to be the easiest option. You can then seek further 
information if it doesn't suite your situation.

A few things you will need to do. I'll assume your going keep the source 
inside ParaView tree. Eg. You might place the source in 
ParaView3/Servers/Filters. The simplest way to get the PV UI is to 
leverage ParaView's XML parser by defining the interface to your filter. 
PV will parse your XML & create a panel for you. Here are the things 
you'll need to do:

1)
Edit the Filters_SRCS section of:
ParaView3/Servers/Filters/CMakeLists.txt
so that your source is built with ParaView. You may/may not need to use 
"//BTX" and "//ETX" comments in your header to eXclude parts of your 
public interface from the python/tcl wrappings (or alternatively add 
your filter to the WRAP_EXCLUDE section.

2)
Edit:
ParaView3/Qt/Components/Resources/XML/ParaViewFilters.xml
add
<Filter name="MyName" />

3)
Edit:
ParaView3/Servers/ServerManager/Resources/filters.xml
Here you'll have to write a brief section of XML code that defines your 
filter's interface. You can take a look at some of the other filters 
there for some examples.


Did I forget anything? Also you'll want to check out the ParaView and 
VTK Guide,http://www.kitware.com/products/books.html it has  these steps 
spelled out much more clearly. And our wiki 
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView has more info on plugins (one of 
your other options).

Hey Jean,

Thanks a lot for passing along that PDF of how you guys use ParaView  
with Python, and thanks, too, for letting me know that in some cases  
it does work to change the reader file names from Python within  
ParaView -- I'll try it again sometime.

It sounds like you've had more luck both with parallel read speed, as  
well as usage from within Python, now that you wrote your own custom  
HDF5 reader. (Is that the BioH5 source?) Maybe one of these days I'll  
have to learn how to do that, but it always sounds like a long,  
painful process to get it working really well. We use the Xdmf  
wrappers for our HDF5 for now.

Talk to you later,
-Eric

As an alternative to modifying the ParaView source, you can build your filter into a plugin.  Building plugins is about as easy as modifying the ParaView source and they are much easier to maintain and distribute.  You can get information about building plugins on the Wiki.

I am still encounteering major difficulties with Xdmf (cvs version of 
yesterday). Speed and Memory. When reading in parallel for example, the 
Xdmf reader attemps to allocate memory for the WHOLE grid on every node 
(independent of the number of pvserver nodes) causing memory crashes. 
There must be a problem reading the Extents. Using straight HDF5, I pass 
the Extents as hyperslabs and it works fine. I can read 2048^3 in 
parallel. For smaller grids, if memory is not a problem, the Xdmf 
wrapper works too, still considerably slower.

To try to solve your problem another way, you can create multiple readers that read files with the same extension and resolve which one to use by implementing a CanReadFile method.  Before assigning a file to a particular VTK reader class, ParaView will try to run a method called CanReadFile that takes a const char* filename argument.  If that method exists and returns false, that reader is not used.  This process works outside of the server manager functions, so you don't need to make any modifications to the server manager XML.

There are several examples of readers in VTK/IO that implement the CanReadFile convention.  You can look at those for more details.

As I recall, first reader found that either has no CanReadFile or a CanReadFile that returns true is used, and the readers are traversed from the last registered to the first.  This is so that readers defined by plugins can conditionally override readers for file extensions that already exist.

Jean,

Has the large grid ever worked in the past ... I may have
broken the extents when I modified the parallelism for spatial
collections.

If I broke the parallelism, that might explain the slowness
on smaller grids.

I'm assuming that the Xdmf xml just specifies a single
structured grid.

Then you are in good company. This question has been asked by enough

Subject: [Paraview] Mesa/Offscreen Rendering
Message-ID: <48B46074.70006@arl.army.mil>

Is there an issue with offscreen rendering and mesa in the CVS?   I'm 
building Paraview from a CVS download from Monday.     I'm configuring 
this to run on one of our clusters that does not have GL cards and I 
believe that I'm building against mesa.

When I fire up pvserver and connect back to the client, and load up some 
geometry (max'd out sphere, for instance), I get a number of X-windows 
errors on the server side, like it's trying to connect back to my display.

Process id: 3 >> ERROR: In 
/build/src/ParaView-08.25.08/VTK/Rendering/vtkXOpenGLRenderWindow.cxx, 
line 1478
vtkXOpenGLRenderWindow (0xb62160): bad X server connection. 
DISPLAY=hpc-cluster-l7:10.0

The HPC node does not have GL cards and is not running an X server.   
Other than spewing X-errors, I am getting updated GL on the client - 
it's just not clear to me that it's actually doing distributed SW 
rendering on the server side.  

I have a build from the last production release (3.2.1) that behaves 
properly ... but I didn't do that build!   8-)

Rick,

A few months ago Utkarsh worked with me to get pvbatch to run without an X server. He didn't have the time to figure out what was creating those warnings. I haven't updated from CVS for a while but this sounds like the same thing, only from pvserver instead of pvbatch.

We ran pvbatch with 256 nodes on an XT3 where there was not only no X server but no way for it to connect back to a display. Many warnings but it worked.

Curiously (or maybe not so curiously) if I "xhost  +" on the client 
side, the errors on the server side go away!    8-)      So, this 
problem did not exist in 3.2.1, but was somehow introduced the 
development tree?      It seems to work quite well with the production 
release ... no X errors, etc.

Rick,

Are you simply getting the error message or it even fails to render? 
There's some issue (which I will look into hopefully soon) which results 
in that error message, but that should not affect the actual rendering.

Also just to confirm, you are using the --use-offscreen-rendering 
command line option on the server.

I ran pvbatch everyday on a parallel server without graphics and I can
confirm it works fine. My trick was to comment out line 1478 of the file
above. It does not complain anymore and it runs just fine.

?//vtkErrorMacro(<< "bad X server connection. DISPLAY=" <<
vtksys::SystemTools::GetEnv("DISPLAY") << "\n");

sounds like a candidate for cleanup before a 3.4 official release...

I think I see the problem.  I'll test a fix tonight, probably check in a fix tomorrow, and this should work in ParaView 3.4.

Message-ID: <BAY122-W1257DEC7C5020150997090BC610@phx.gbl>


Hi!
I have trouble building paraview from the source:
I have downloaded the source via CVS, I have installed CMake and QT 4.4.1 open source, but running CMake it says that the QT-QMAKE-EXECUTABLE is not found. I tried to insert the path manually and reconfiguring, it says again that it could not find it. 
How to fix this? How can I make sure that I installed Qt correctly (although I ran the install wizard successfully?) How to set that QT-QMAKE-EXECUTABLE path correctly?
Is it possible that the problem orginates from the fact, that I have compiled and installed QT with MinGW and want to build Paraview with the Visual Studio 2008 Express edition?

Well, and the other problem also originating is that it says, the PARAVIEW_DATA_ROOT is not found. What can I do about that?

thanks for helping,
Natalie Happenhofer

No, its not possible to mix the compilers for QT and Paraview, you
have to use the same compiler for both applications.

you can download this data from
<http://www.paraview.org/files/v3.2/ParaViewData3.2.zip>,
but this option is not required for building paraview (AFAIK).

It does render despite the error messages.     And yes, I am using

Hello,

PARAVIEW_DATA_ROOT is the directory where regression test data is
kept. It is perfectly fine for it to be NOT_FOUND if you are not
interested in testing. If you are then you can download the test data
off of the paraview web site and correct the cmake variable.

QT-QMAKE-EXECUTABLE is not being found because ParaView does not yet
officially support QT 4.4. You can either install QT 4.3 (a binary
install is fine), or change the line in ParaView's top level
CMakeList.txt file after "#don't go greater than supported version" to
let ParaView use QT 4.4.

cheers,
Dave DeMarle

For which filter or source are you seeing this? It most likely means
magnitude of a vector. If you go to the help page for that
filter/source does it describe the meaning?

If it is the exodus reader, the apply displacements enabled means the reader will look for a vector variable dislp_{x,y,z} or variants of that, and add the vector to the nodal coordinates at each time step. The mag is a factor that rescales the displacement vector, set to 1 by default.  X(t) = X(0) + mag*displ(t).

Well,
I installed QT 4.3 now (with MinGW) and then I tried to build Paraview with the "MinGW Makefiles" -Option when it asks for the compiler, but still, the same problem originates: 

"QMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:89 (Message): Qt 4.3.0 or greater not found. Please check the QT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE variable. "

Here is the part of CMakeLists.txt which posts the error:

  # ParaView requires this minimum version of Qt, and let's do it here before
  # our first call to FindQt4.cmake
  SET(QT_MIN_VERSION "4.3.0")
  SET(QT_REQUIRED TRUE)
  FIND_PACKAGE(Qt4)
  IF(NOT QT4_FOUND)
    MESSAGE(SEND_ERROR "Qt ${QT_MIN_VERSION} or greater not found.  Please check the QT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE variable.")
  ELSE(NOT QT4_FOUND)
    # don't go greater than supported version
    STRING(REGEX MATCH "^4\\.3\\.[0-9]+" qt_version_tmp "${QTVERSION}")

Do you have any ideas what to try next?

Make sure that the qmake program associated with the Qt 4.3 version is the first in your path.  Also make sure that you do a clean build (i.e. delete your binary directory and start over again).

Ok, now the executable is found, but I get the following warning:
"QT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE reported QT_INSTALL_LIBS as C:\iwmake\build_mingw_opensource/lib "

and next I get the error, that this directory does not exist. 
Well, it does not exist (I looked it up) but qt does run, so I don?t want to believe that it was not correctly installed.
Where should that QT_INSTALL_LIBS variable point to?

It appears it was not correctly installed.  QT_INSTALL_LIBS, QT_INSTALL_BINS, 
and others come from qmake, and are compiled into it.  The values of those 
are determined when you configure your Qt build.  And Qt must be installed to 
those locations.

So far I am citing it as:

Sandia National Labs, Kitware Inc, and Los Alamos National Labs.
Paraview: Parallel visualization application. http://paraview.org,
2000-2008.


Please let me know if you want it to be cited differently.

You could use the ParaView Guide.

A citation of the guide might look like this:

I usually cite The ParaView Guide.  You can get the relevant publication
information at

Message-ID: <d0767b160808271525q583ced07g3c95b777400cef19@mail.gmail.com>

Hi there.
I try to use a 64 bit linux to run paraview and I can compile and install it
successfully. The problem is when I run the software in the parallel mode, I
get errors like this:
paraview(15611): unaligned access to 0x20000000034381cc,
ip=0x2000000001d84ca1
The rendering speed is quiet slow even when I use lots of CUPs. I don't know
if these errors are reponsible for the slow speed. Does anyone know how to
fix the problem?
Thanks a lot!

What do you mean by running ParaView in parallel?  You are not trying to run the paraview executable in an MPI job, are you?

Hi again,
I have now successfully managed to configure Paraview with CMake and generate the Makefiles. I have been using the MinGW Compiler. 
After generating Cmake turns itself off and now my (surely stupid) question:
What do I do now? How to install now Paraview so I can run it??? 
I?ve looked it up in the wiki, but it is just described using Visual Studio.. 

thanks for help,
Natalie Happenhofer

Then you probably need to build it by running mingw32-make in the directory 
CMake generated the top level makefile.
I've gone that far before, but I don't know if anyone has gone as far as 
installing it.  You can try with a "mingw32-make install"

That is correct.  From your description of the error, I thought you might have been trying to run "mpirun -np 4 ./paraview", which will not work.

I've never run into your error (although I have little experience with 64-bit builds).  From the details you gave I cannot know what might be causing the rendering slowness, but have you tried compiling everything 32-bit?  That would at least give you comparison timing and help you narrow down whether the problem is related to the 64-bit build.

Hi Ken.
Thanks for you reply. Sorry for the confusion.
I am not sure if I get what you mean. but I run the paraview server program in an MPI job and then run the paraview executable to connect to the server. The command which I use to start paraview server is: "mpirun -np 4 ./pvserver".
Is this the information you want from me? Please let me know if I am wrong.
Thanks again!

To be honest, I'm not sure.  I've only ever done it on Mac.  I think you may have to set the CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS to add a gcc flag to compile 32-bit (probably using the -march flag or something equivalent).  Of course, you would have to make sure the variable is set at the beginning of the first invocation of CMake to ensure that the TRY_RUNs provide the right information.

Thanks for your advice. I really appreciate.
This might be a silly question, but I don't know how to control the 64 bit or 32 bit compile. Is there an cmake option for that or should I try to compile it on a 32 bit system?
Cheers,

Great, thanks a lot!
Just if anyone is encountering the same problem, that?s what I did:

run "mingw32-make" in the directory where you want to build Paraview (if you have not done it yet, add the path of the MinGW -executables to your PATH variable)
run "mingw32-make install" in this directory 

then you should find a paraview.exe file in C:\Programme\Paraview

Hi,
I am using Paraview 3.3, and was wondering if there is any way to 
interrupt a "save animation" action: this one is running a pvd with a 
collection of 300 vtu
and takes quite a long time.
thanks a lot a any body having a trick.

Hi to everyone.
Perhaps I was too generic in my previous question.
First question:
- does someone know and use ADINA fem package?
Second question:
- has someone developed a filter (=reader) to import ADINA result file 
(=porthole) in Paraview?
Third question:
- if yes in previous question, does you like to share this reader, or at 
least send instructions to develop it?
Thanks a lot

When saving out an animation, in the status bar at the bottom a 
red-cross button (next to the progress bar) should be enabled. You can 
click that to cancel the saving of the animation.

ok, so bad for me: thanks a lot... :)
it appears that the saved .Avi animation gives back a lower quality than 
the original display (pixels/inch)
it is redimensionned when starting the save process to respect the X/Y 
ratio I guess. but I do not see any
control to fix that issue.

thanks  a lot

Hi Utkarsh,

I had another look into the issue again, and concluded that it's a bug
in ParaView. The tracker ID is #7583.

The main problem was indeed in the removal of the
this->Internal->Property->ResetToDefault() call. Before the removal
the ResetToDefault() call subsequently executed
vtkSMArraySelectionDomain::SetDefaultValues() which copies the
contents of associated information property to the
StringVectorProperty.

However with the removal now there's nothing which links the
information property and the StringVector property, despite the
server-client downlink (client/server stream->information
helper->information property->array selection domain->string vector
property) worked properly until the update of ArraySelectionDomain
which interfaces the two properties. Hence the StringDomain of the
newly added array name is found in
pqSMAdaptor::getSelectionProperty(vtkSMProperty*, unsigned int) while
the corresponding StringVectorProperty is not, which led to the "had
to make up a value for selection" text output.

I think the fix intended by the removal of ResetToDefault() must be
done elsewhere.

For clarification, I attached a pseudo reader plugin to demonstrate
the problem. Just build as a usual plugin, load into ParaView, and try
reading any stub file with the *.pseudo extension. After clicking
Apply, you'll see the "had to make up..." message every time you move
the timestep back and forth.

Subject: [Paraview] Help with ghost cells and parallel interfaces
Message-ID: <48B80755.8080009@nacad.ufrj.br>


Folks,

I'm loading parallel files that do not have ghost information and I'd 
like to remove the parallel interface between mesh partitions. In older 
versions (2.x), the "clean to grid" filter would be enough to do such 
task, but it's not possible in PV3 anymore. I don't know how is the 
development status but, I guess, it's not working because all parallel 
readers load the data as multiblocks and this filter is not able to deal 
with multiblocks, yet. Is there any workaround for it? I've tried the D3 
filter to create the ghost cells before "clean to grid" but it has not 
worked too.

Any hint?

regards

Renato.

Cool, quite interesting idea.

Correct if I'm saying something nonsense. Could an offscreen-rendered 
image be sent to a "web-paraview-client"? I guess Berk could clarify it...

I've just found a way using the "Merge blocks" filter before "Clean to

Message-ID: <497fe5210808291145m2412de08lc4b4d3e8081cee76@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

When I use paraview built-in or client-server mode, PV_PLUGIN_PATH points to
a folder that has all of my Server and Client plugins. When I open the
paraview client, my server and client plugins have all been automatically
loaded.

When I use paraview MPI however, only the client plugins are loaded
automatically. I must load the server plugins manually.

What environment variable should be used to load remote server plugins in
MPI?

Message-ID: <4ec2a6850808291315k3fdd5ed1ia6e0dcdf54b34e2e@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I have usually been a happy user of Paraview. Since today, something
very strange is happening.

It started taking up very long to load (beyond 3 minutes), and
according to the Task Manager (I use Windows XP SP2, with 1GB RAM), it
was taking a little bit over 400MB of memory, without any data loaded.
Anything that I wanted to do on the PC turned out to be extremely
slow. After I closed Paraview, it was still running, according to Task
Manager, and taking over 300MB of memory. Previously, none of this
happened, and it took no more than 15 seconds to load.

Just in case, I have uninstalled my Paraview 3.2.0, VTK 5.0, rebooted
the PC, and reinstalled VTK 5.2.0, Paraview 3.2.1, all in that order.
And I still have the problem. Any clue?

Thanks a lot.

Message-ID: <85b5c3130808300611x6ed8838by91933d47c258c30a@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

in order for paraview to endup in Debian lenny, it needs to work on
sparc, and currently it fails with "bus error" when building[0],
however, we narrowed the problem down and thanks to many people and
especially Jurij Smakov, we have a patch that makes it work[1]. I
suggest you to read the whole bug report [0], to understand what's
going on.

Unfortunately, Jurij is then experiencing weird failures at different
point in the build (and many times the build succeeds) [2], so I
wanted to ask if anyone in the paraview list has any experiences with
paraview on sparc. Any help is appreciated.

Thanks a lot,
Ondrej

Here is what is happening. During the build process, ParaView runs
vtkSMExtractDocumentation to generate its HTML documentation. This
executable is linked against most of what VTK requires. When the build
process tries to run vtkSMExtractDocumentation, it fails because the
MPI library cannot be found. This is due to the fact that
VTK_USE_RPATH is off. You have a few options to fix this problems:

* Turn VTK_USE_RPATH on - cons: make install will not work properly
* Add the MPI library path to LD_LIBRARY_PATH
* Upgrade to CVS ParaView.

CVS paraview allows you to choose between volume rendering algoritms.
Note that those algorithms are available only for unstructured grids.
Currently, we support only one algorithm for image data.

Subject: [Paraview] vtkWedge::Triangulate() returns inverted tetrahedron
Message-ID: <20080831.111139.43140439.oshima@eng.niigata-u.ac.jp>

Hi there,

I got a negative volume whose absolute value is also incorrect for a
mesh with all VTK_WEDGEs. To replicate,

1. Open the attached wedge.vtk.
2. Apply Integrate Variables.
3. Choose Cell Data from the combo box at the top of spreadsheet view.

The volume is shown as -0.166667 instead of the expected value of
0.5. Looks like this is because vtkWedge::Triangulate() is returning
an inverted tetrahedron at line 244 of vtkIntegrateAttributes.cxx.

The tracker ID is 7588.

You'll need CVS paraview, as Berk said.  Then it's in the object
inspector panel, under the style group box on the display tab.  The
Volume Mapper combobox will be enabled when the Representation
combobox is set to Volume (and if the data is unstructured grid).

the input.

  vtkDataArary *input_array =3D this->GetInputArrayToProcess(0, input);

By the way, I notice that you are using the old-style filter convention of
overriding Execute and calling GetInput and GetOutput on yourself.  New
filters should really override RequestData and get the inputs and outputs
from the inputVector and outputVector arguments, respectively.  The data
objects have convenience methods to get the data objects from the
information vectors.

  vtkStructuredGrid *input =3D vtkStructuredGrid::GetData(inputVector[0]);
  vtkStructuredGrid *output =3D vtkStructuredGrid::GetData(outputVector);

could try using ldd to make sure that pvserver is linking against all of th=
e
libraries you are expecting.  You may also try running pvserver in a
debugger to find out exactly where it is trying to open an X window.
