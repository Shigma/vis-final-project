I contributed the initial PDB. XYZ and Gaussian readers. They're still 
preliminary and I don't think they have much future given the current 
state of ParaView, that is PV is just not built for Chemistry.

I can recommend a wonderful open-source package for your job. VMD 
http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/ is an excellent package.

I still use PV for one specific task which VMD cannot tackle: Viewing 
the molecule stored in a Gaussian Cube file AND viewing the cube volume 
itself with slices and isosurfaces.

Back to your question. Animation might have worked at the time I created 
the reader. I don't remember. I remember specifically that I made it 
work for another format we use (PDB + DCD). The DCD part contains 
time-dependent coordinates of atoms in binary. Most of my testing (back 
in 2003) was done with VTK + Tcl, which is not quite the same as a PV 
solution.

Subject: [Paraview] volume rendering/ isosurfaces from a adaptive subset of
 a regular grid.
Message-ID: <4276997C.7080104@colorado.edu>

Hello
   I am back to working on visualizing my data in ParaView, which 
consists of an adaptive set of points that lie on a subset of a regular 
mesh.
I have a couple more  questions.   One way to  attack visualizing  my 
problem is to interpolate  some more data points,
such that I have an AMR type grid of different size cubes. Then I should 
be able to generate a hexahedral grid  with connectivity.
So a couple questions about doing this.

1)  Are hexahedral grid elements the only type supported for 
unstructured volume rendering and isosurfaces?

2) Do the faces of the hexahedral elements need to be contiguous? (i.e.. 
can four small faces meet up with one large face?)

3) Is there any limit on the number of  unstructured grid elements that 
can be volume rendered with ParaView?

4) I noticed that KitWare has a phase 1 SBIR for working on AMR 
visualization. Will this code end up in ParaView?
   

Thanks for the info..

Dan

Hi Daniel,

>volume rendering and isosurfaces?

Actually, I believe all the unstructured grid volume rendering methods 
currently work on tetra - so ParaView automatically tetrahedralizes your 
data for you before rendering.

>2) Do the faces of the hexahedral elements need to be contiguous? (i.e.. 
>can four small faces meet up with one large face?)

The tetrahedral model can be an arbitrary set of tetrahedra.


>3) Is there any limit on the number of  unstructured grid elements that 
>can be volume rendered with ParaView?

Yes - the current version cannot handle large grids (large being more than 
maybe a few hundred thousand elements) because of the memory overhead of 
the method. Sandia has a nice hardware projection technique which is being 
incorporated in ParaView now - this will handle much larger grids  and will 
be much faster than the current method.


>4) I noticed that KitWare has a phase 1 SBIR for working on AMR 
>visualization. Will this code end up in ParaView?

If we get a Phase II it is likely to show up in ParaView. This is not 
likely to happen very soon - if we get Phase II the funding would not start 
until January I believe. However, the base classes will be in VTK within 
the next month or so.

Hi all,

I was wondering if anybody could give me a hand about exporting data
produced by Paraview's filters...

Being more specific: Does anybody know how to export data in a "human
readable manner" (ASCII) from Paraview? Will I have to write a VTK file
writer by myself and recompile Paraview to do it or there is an easier way?

Thanks for any help

If you execute this python script it will transform your vtk binary to vtk 
ASCII

#!/usr/bin/python

import string
import vtk

filename="filenamehere" #no .vtk ending

r = vtk.vtkDataSetReader()
r.SetFileName(filename+'vtk')

###write stuff
w = vtk.vtkDataSetWriter()
w.SetInput( r.GetOutput() )
w.SetFileName(filename+'ascii.vtk')
w.Write()

 Ok. I can generate hexahedral elements fairly easily from my data. What 
is the overhead for ParaView to "automaticly tetrahedralizes" the data?
If it is low then it is best for me to make hexahedra and let ParaView 
make tetrahedra from them. Does this sound like a reasonable plan?

 Ok this relates to the response above.  If I generate hexahedra such 
that a face never mates with more then one face but
mutiple small faces can match to a larger face, will Paraview be able to 
make a clean tetrahedral grid from it that will
make good isosurfaces without cracks and holes?  I want to understand 
the consequences of how I generate the grids before hand.

   Can you point me to a reference to this project. I am interested in 
what hardware they are using (so I can see if I can get access to the 
same hardware..)


   Thanks a million for the help!  I'm impressed with ParaView so far!

If you save the data in legacy vtk format, it's quite straightforward to
write a python script to convert the binary data to ascii.
Something along the line of

import vtk

ugr = vtk.vtkUnstructuredGridReader()
ugr.SetFileName("MyBinFile.vtk")
ugr.Update()

ugw = vtk.vtkUnstructuredGridWriter()
ugw.SetInput(ugr.GetOutput())
ugw.SetFileTypeToAscii()
ugw.SetFileName("MyHumanlyReadableAsciiFile.vtk")
ugw.Write()

If the data is another format (see header?!) then you might have to use a
different reader/writer combination.
Don't know if that's valid for all formats though.

Subject: [Paraview] Additional light sources
Message-ID: <1115183167.30244.5.camel@whirl.lab7.lan>

Hi,

I try to visualize fairly complex CFD data and I've got a problem.
The resulting scene has many details and some of them are not
clearly seen as they are in a shadow. If I change an orientation
other details become shadowed.

My question is:

Is it possible to add additional light sources to the final scene
or is it possible to move the existing light source?

Stas,

	Which version of ParaView are you using ? If you use ParaView from CVS 
you can play with lights (Key, Fill, Back and Head lights) on the 3D 
Views/Light Kit Parameter. If you don't want to use CVS, you'll have to 
wait for ParaView 2.2.

Hi all,

I downloaded the linux sources for the latest paraview ( version 2.0, 
release 1 ).   I also recompiled my custom reader that I have been using 
with the earlier version.  I keep getting the following error messages that 
I have not seen before,

================================================================
ErrorMessage
# Error or warning: There was a VTK Error in file: 
/home/ravilanka/downloads/paraview-2.0.1/GUI/Client/vtkPVArraySelection.cxx 
(228)
An appropriate property not specified. Can not update
ErrorMessage end
================================================================

I am not sure if I have to modify either the readers.xml or the Readers.xml 
with the new version.

thanks in advance

Ravi

When you said, vtkPVArraySelection.cxx is trying to get a 
vtkSMStringVectorProperty from readers.xml, what exactly is it looking for. 
I did  not modify any String/Vector Properties in readers.xml shown below.

Try making the changes indicated below.  If this fixes the problem, it 
means that ParaView couldn't find your information-only string vector property.

Amy,
Thank you very much.  I changed the xml file as you suggested and it is 
working fine now.

I have a follow up question on the xml. Currently my  "UpdateTimeStep" Node 
of type "IntVectorProperty" has a min of 1 and max of 128.  The max value is 
actually an output of theanalysis that I would like to dynamically change. 
Is there a way to access these node attributes.

      <IntVectorProperty
            name="UpdateTimeStep"
            command="SetUpdateTimeStep"
            number_of_elements="1"
            default_values="0">
            <IntRangeDomain name="range" min="1" max="128" />
        </IntVectorPropertty>

Ravi

Message-ID: <4280BB05.6020805@t-online.de>

Hi,

I am trying to compile ParaView(2.01) on
Windows 2000, VC++ 6.0, Cmake 2.0

and with build_all it stops at:

E:\paraview\Utilities\hdf5\H5detect.c(95) : error C2061: Syntaxfehler : 
Bezeichner 'jbuf_g'

I dont know the reason for this error and in the
paraview-guide-book  I was looking for some configuration-
infos for windows, but threre I couldnt find the necc. infos.

I did exactly what was written in the compiling.html for
windows-installation!
but as you can see compiling is impossible!
perhaps in cmake I have to change some configurations,
but I dont know what ? or is there a tool missing in my system?
(compiling of vtk-only(4.2), works perfect!)

is it poss. for someone to help me in this matter?

regards
Franz

I saw that a fix for this bug was committed to CVS, but was wondering  
when we can expect to see a release which contains the fix.

Also, is this a failure that happens every time ParaView 2.0.1 is run  
in client/server mode?  Or was there some rare condition that was met  
that most users will not run into?  We are deploying ParaView in a  
production environment, and are trying to decide whether we should go  
with 2.0.1, or wait for the next release.

Thanks,
joe.

Hi Joe,

According to Utkarsh, this bug was introduced into ParaView after ParaView 
2.0 was released, so this should not be an issue in ParaView 2.0.1.

Hi, all,
    Now we have a server machine with multiple processors that use Linux OS, and we want to use a PC with Windows XP as the client. Is it possible to run the paraview in C/S mode on different OS platform?
    By the way, if the server machine dose not have graphic card and display device, can the Render server and Data server of Paraview run on this machine?
    Thanks a lot!

Best,
Nancy

Hi Andrew,

I'm posting this back to the ParaView users' list.  This way other people 
have the benefit of seeing the whole thread.

When you were having problem connecting an XP client to a linux server, was 
it in the development version or in 2.0?

Message-ID: <E4C1C0FFED3E6B49AC2C1DA9723BE11ED50450@ES20SNLNT.srn.sandia.gov>

Nancy,

Sure we do it all the time. There are issues sometimes with how the
connection works. Lots of time when you run on a linux server you do a
'qsub' or equivalent and you don't know which nodes you will actually
get and even when you know which nodes you will get, your client machine
will not be able to connect 'into' that particular node. 

BUT, this is all solved by doing -rc (reverse connect) on both the
server and client. So you launch the client on windows with -rc (you can
make a shortcut to pvclient and add the -rc arg in the 'properties' of
the shortcut).
After the client is running you launch the server with -rc and that
client machine name as -ch arg.

Regarding the server not having graphics cards that is also just fine.
Any machine these days will run openGL even if they don't have a
graphics card in them. The one wrinkle is that paraview server
(pvserver) will normally open up an X window to do the parallel
rendering. If your cluster is setup to allow that your done. If not you
will need to compile paraview with mesa and then the X window thing is
not an issue.

We do not ever use paraview as a data server. We always use just the
vanilla (pvclient-pvserver) and the servers do both data handling and
rendering (even on machines with mesa) and then stream images to the
client desktop. We find this model works really well. I know other folks
that use data servers and renders servers but they are just weird and
should receive some sort of medical attention. (Of course I'm being
silly, but I do have strong opinions about why that mode of operation is
not a good idea for most use cases).

Anyway, if you have any questions just let me know.

Hi Franz,

What (if any) CMake options did you change when you were trying to build 
ParaView?  Can you send a copy of the CMakeCache.txt file (in your ParaView 
build directory)?

Hi Franz,

I'm copying this back to the ParaView users' list so see if anybody else 
sees anything in the CMakeCache.txt file.

In case anyone is wondering, the translation of the reported error message 
into English is:
E:\paraview\Utilities\hdf5\H5detect.c(95): error C2061: Syntax error: 
Designator ' jbuf_g '

Yes, that is totally fine. Having the volume rendering tetrahedralize
the data is pretty quick.

This should also be fine. Unstructured data makes no assumptions about
how faces of elements match up.

No special hardware. The 'hardware' method Lisa is referring to, is the
translation of tetrahedral cell elements into properly 'shaded'
triangles that get processed by the OpenGL library (w or w/o graphics
card... "hardware"). The basis of the algorithm is actually quite old
(Projected Tetrahedra.. Shirley and Tuchman.. 1986 I believe... :)

Just a general note, this is 'unstructured' volume rendering. Going to
be much slower than structure volume rendering, so be prepared for slug
like performance. :)

It is the development version. When I attempt to open a file on the server (
A Debian Linux box) I get the following message on the client ( XP ):
----------------------
There was a VTK Error in file:  vtk ParaView Servers ServerManager
vtkSMIntVectorProperty.cxx (283)
 No default value is specified for property: ActiveFileIsDirectory. This
might lead to stability problems
There was a VTK Error in file:  vtk ParaView Servers ServerManager
vtkSMIntVectorProperty.cxx (283)
 No default value is specified for property: ActiveFileIsReadable. This
might lead to stability problems
----------------------

If I quit and restart, then there are no error messages and everything seems
to be OK. Hoerver ... after a while ... if you are saving an animation to
disk I get this error message:
--------------------------
There was a VTK Error in file:  vtk ParaView Gui Client vtkPVApplication.cxx
(1686)
 TclTk error: Uncaught exception: bad allocation
--------------------------

Something has recently changed because the program used to just crash.

Hi Andrew,

I'm posting this back to the ParaView users' list.  This way other people 
have the benefit of seeing the whole thread.

When you were having problem connecting an XP client to a linux server, was 
it in the development version or in 2.0?

 process) with Tiled dispaly? 
Message-ID: <42831E8E.000030.31566@bjapp17>

We run paraview with c/s model, on server, we run two 2 processes (two PCs connect with mpi). The mpi configure of device is ch_p4.
Use other one PC as client connect to server with Tiled Display. The command and error message like this:

[root@xgy bin]# ./pvserver

I'm copying this message back to the ParaView users' list too so everybody 
can benefit from the answer.

Subject: [Paraview] Flipped mhd vector fields
Message-ID: <428379D4.2010603@dkfz-heidelberg.de>

Hi,

if I load vector fields stored in Meta Image Data Files (*.mha), and use 
the glyph filter, the result seems to be flipped along the y-Axis. Is 
this an intended behaviour for mhd files or is there any way around this 
Problem?

Best regards,

Max

Max,

	Are you using ParaView from source ? If so can you recompile paraview 
after having patch the following file"

Subject: [Paraview] Displaying elemental data
Message-ID: <BAY107-F1861AFB4AAA0B5A70CF9B287110@phx.gbl>

To Whom It May Concern,

I am working on an XML file (.xmf) that displays some partitioned data when 
viewed through paraview. The partitioned data is stored between the 
<Attribute> tags and displays fine except it displays the values as nodal 
values and not elementally as I would like.

Does Paraview have a simple way to display elementally and not nodal?

Pasted below is a copy of the XML file (outDISK.xmf) that I am working with.

Thanks to anyone who has any idea/hint on how to solve this.




Sincerely,

Richard Haney

Subject: [Paraview] Possible bug in client/server mode regarding file
	opening.
In-Reply-To: <200505120109.j4C19Cc9006393@trado.ucc.usyd.edu.au>
References: <200505120109.j4C19Cc9006393@trado.ucc.usyd.edu.au>
Message-ID: <4283CF9B.3030705@kitware.com>

The problem with opening a data file on the server has now been fixed 
(in CVS).

However, I was not able to reproduce the problem saving an animation. I 
had my client on a Win XP box and a server (run with mpirun -np 2) on a 
Debian box. ( I tried the opposite as well : server on Win XP and client 
on debian).

Can you verify if the animation saving problem has been fixed? If not 
could you please describe a reproducable scenario.

Thanks,
Utkarsh

The file opening problem seems to be fixed, thanks for that. 

With restpect to saving the animation, I have the client on the XP box (
pvclient -sh=linux_box ) and the server on a debian box ( pvserver
-ch=xp_box ).

I am saving a mp2 file 66s long with a resolution of around 717 by 619
pixels.  This saves OK producing an mp2 file of around 21Mb, but anything
larger resolution fails. It looks to be a memory allocation problem because
memory usage rises to around 1.8Gb on the XP machine and 1GB on the server.


Thanks

Andrew

opening.

The problem with opening a data file on the server has now been fixed 
(in CVS).

However, I was not able to reproduce the problem saving an animation. I 
had my client on a Win XP box and a server (run with mpirun -np 2) on a 
Debian box. ( I tried the opposite as well : server on Win XP and client 
on debian).

Can you verify if the animation saving problem has been fixed? If not 
could you please describe a reproducable scenario.

Thanks,
Utkarsh

Subject: [Paraview] Bug in image Calculator?
Message-ID: <428457D6.10706@dkfz-heidelberg.de>

Hi,

if I try to flip the orientation of the y-component of the vectors in a 
vector field according to the description given in 
http://public.kitware.com/pipermail/insight-users/2004-August/010250.html
using the formula ImageFile_0*iHat - ImageFile_1*jHat + ImageFile_2*kHat 
using all paraview versions above 1.4 nothing happens (which means, that 
the output vector field is the same as the input vector field). Using 
paraview 1.4.2 the results were as expected...

Thanks,

Max

I am working with 16M, 64M vertices meshes using an unstructured CFD code.

I can view the 2M solution on my workstation 3.0 Ghs with 2.5 Gb RAM. It

My question: For those working with 2M > meshes, what RAMs do you use?

I cannot reproduce this in ParaView 2.0 and the development version.
How are you verifying that the vectors are not flipped? Are you using
the glyph filter? If yes, did you make sure you are using the right
vector in glyph (where it says Vectors on the Orient/Scale interface)?

Hi Stephen,

Try this:

Load the 2M solution file, bring up the command prompt (Window ->
Command Prompt), in the command prompt type the following:

[[[$Application GetMainWindow] GetCurrentPVSource] GetDataInformation]
GetMemorySize

This should give you the memory usage for the dataset in Kbytes. This
works in parallel also. I am guessing for datasets of that size, the
processing is going be very slow unless you start running on a small
cluster.

Hi Franz,

In ParaView, you can change which mouse button / modifier key combination 
(left, middle, and right mouse buttons plus the Shift and Ctrl 
buttons).  The UI for making these changes is found by selecting "3D View 
Properties" from the View menu and then going to the Camera tab.  There is 
no way in ParaView to specify functionality for different keyboard keys.

Hello,

I have attached the files I have used. For verification of vector 
orientation I have used the glyph-filter with the following settings for 
all images:

   Orient-Mode = Vector
   Scale Mode = Vector Magnitude
   Scale Factor =  1
   Vectors = Image File

If I  "transform" the file coordinateField_3x3x3.mhd (see image 
vectors-before-calculate.png) using the image calculator and the formula 
ImageFile_0*iHat - ImageFile_1*jHat + ImageFile_2*kHat paraview-1.4.2 
gave me the results i expected (vectors-after-calculate.png). Using 
paraview versions >= 1.6 the glyphed output of the calculator looks the 
same as depicted in vectors-before-calculate.png.

Note: in the current cvs version a bug has been fixed, which resulted in 
flipped vector fields if they were read from mhd files. So if you use 
the cvs-version from today, you have to swap the to images in mind ;-) 
Anyway, i think this is unrelated to the calculator behaviour i am 
observing.

Thanks,

Max

Hello,

I have attached the files I have used. For verification of vector
orientation I have used the glyph-filter with the following settings for
all images:

    Orient-Mode = Vector
    Scale Mode = Vector Magnitude
    Scale Factor =  1
    Vectors = Image File

If I  "transform" the file coordinateField_3x3x3.mhd (see image
vectors-before-calculate.png) using the image calculator and the formula
ImageFile_0*iHat - ImageFile_1*jHat + ImageFile_2*kHat paraview-1.4.2
gave me the results i expected (vectors-after-calculate.png). Using
paraview versions >= 1.6 the glyphed output of the calculator looks the
same as depicted in vectors-before-calculate.png.

Note: in the current cvs version a bug has been fixed, which resulted in
flipped vector fields if they were read from mhd files. So if you use
the cvs-version from today, you have to swap the to images in mind ;-)
Anyway, i think this is unrelated to the calculator behaviour i am
observing.

Thanks,

Max

Subject: [Paraview] General X window issue when running paraview server
Message-ID: <E4C1C0FFED3E6B49AC2C1DA9723BE11ED509AA@ES20SNLNT.srn.sandia.gov>

All,

There is a general issue about how X windows get opened when running
pvserver on a PC cluster. Normally X windows will not allow an x window
to be opened if you are not 'logged into the display (console)'. So if I
set my DISPLAY to :0.0 and I run an mpi job that simply launches
'xclock' on 4 different nodes. I will generally get some sort of X error
like... "bad X server connection" or whatever.

This is because the X server is not allowing an X window to be opened
from someone who is not 'on the console'. This is the normal behavior of
an X server. You have to 'bypass' the security feature in order to open
an X window. How you do this is an 'advanced' topic and hopefully you
have a cluster administrator that can help you out with this.

If you do not have an administrator that can do this for you, then let
me know and I can get our cluster guy to give me a list of the
configuration changes made to the X server to allow windows to be opened
by folks not on the console.

Also, do not under any circumstances have your DISPLAY variable set to
anything other than localhost:0.0 (or equiv) when running pvserver. If
you set your DISPLAY variable to any other machine besides localhost you
have completely crippled pvserver. ParaView will have to send X traffic
from one node to another and the whole purpose behind the system design
will be completely bypassed and your performance will probably be 100x
slower.

Hi Max, 

You are glyphing the wrong vectors. Make sure you select "Result" for  Vectors,
not "ImageFile". ImageFile are the original vectors.

Hello David
 
I've provided my Fortran routines to write Ensight's case format (not gold)
in http://www.nacad.ufrj.br/~rnelias/paraview. 
I've been using this format in my CFD application without any problem...
could you compare my routines with yours?
 
cheers

I am receiving the following errors when trying to read an Ensight Gold
'Fortran Binary' file.  Can anyone provide a suggestion for how to proceed?
I have attached the case and geometry files that I was attempting to read
into Paraview.

 

Thanks in advance,

Subject: [Paraview] question about saving postscript images
Message-ID: <4285071E.3060002@psc.edu>

Hello-  I'm using ParaView 2.0.1 in client/server mode
on 64 processors.

When I 'Page Setup' at 300dpi
the 'Print' button outputs a postscript file which shows the middle
of the image from my paraview window, tiled 3 across by 3 high
times (I was hoping for the whole image at 300 dpi).

Can anyone explain to me what the user error here is?
I had this same problem with 1.8.

It works with 100dpi.
And it works when using a single processor.

Thanks-  Greg

Thanks to everyone in the paraview group. This is a great product and I 
really appreciate all the help/hints - I am still in the very early stages

The obvious differences that I see are the following: 

 

1) I am using Ensight Gold format 

2) I am using 'Fortran Binary' formatting.

3) I specify 'node id off' and 'element id off'

 

Does the paraview reader support the Ensight Gold format?

 

David

Thanks for checking into this... I ran similar checks and had the same
results...

I didn't export the files into ASCII format from Ensight (I was unaware of
this feature), but I did start this process by writing out Ensight Gold
ASCII files and they seemed to work fine.

By the way, I saw your old posting.  I was opening my files using
   open(filenum,file='ens.geo',form='unformatted',status='unknown')
After seeing your post I change the 'unformatted' to 'binary' but it still
didn't work in Paraview.  Same results for ens_checker and Ensight8 were
obtained using the 'binary' form...

Should I submit this to the developers as a bug report, or do the
developers catch these via reading the mailing list?  If I need to submit
a bug report, do you know where I should send the information?

Thanks for looking into this and providing feedback.

David

Subject: [Paraview] Simple Filter
Message-ID: <002401c5596b$8da41280$8964a8c0@wolf>

Hi

I have write an app in c++ using vtk which manipulates 
data using vtkStructuredPoints. Starting from this code I 
want to create a paraview-filter but don't know.
 
I would like the Filter to get vtkStructuredPoints as 
input, do some manipulations and give back a 
vtkStructuredPoints class to Paraview. 

Can somebody give me a starting point?

thanks in advance
Wolfgang Lechner

Object named: vtkTemp662, could not find requested method:

I downloaded the latest binary [2.0.1]

Almost any VTK filter should work with ParaView. Check VTK
documentation to see how they are written. I would recommend using
vtkImageData instead of vtkStructuredPoints since it is deprecated. 
vtkSimpleImageToImageFilter would be a good starting point.

Not currently. I would really like to have this in paraview but I
don't have a timeline on when it is going to happen.

David,

I don't know if it doesn?t matter or not but I've been writing the "C
Binary" line to my Ensight files despite using a Fortran compiler. 

I've already tested these routines with Compaq Fortran 6.6a for Windows
systems (Pentium and Athlon processors), Intel Fortran compiler 8.x for
Linux systems (Itanium-2 processor with a SGI Altix) and PGF90 compilers for
Linux systems (Opteron processor with a Cray XD1) without any problem.

Renato, 

Are you are writing out 'C Binary' from a Fortran code?  
Which compiler are you using?  What type of machine and O/S?

Thanks, the class vtkSimpleImagetoImage is indeed
exaclty what I was looking for, and I already wrote
my own filter based on the vtkSimpleImageExample.cxx.

I guess the next step is to write cmakelist, .pvsm.in and 
.xml.in files like in the PVLocal example, or is there 
even a simpler way to get my filter into paraview?

thanks again
wolf

Almost any VTK filter should work with ParaView. Check VTK
documentation to see how they are written. I would recommend using
vtkImageData instead of vtkStructuredPoints since it is deprecated. 
vtkSimpleImageToImageFilter would be a good starting point.

David,

I don't know if it doesn?t matter or not but I've been writing the "C
Binary" line to my Ensight files despite using a Fortran compiler. 

I've already tested these routines with Compaq Fortran 6.6a for Windows
systems (Pentium and Athlon processors), Intel Fortran compiler 8.x for
Linux systems (Itanium-2 processor with a SGI Altix) and PGF90 compilers for
Linux systems (Opteron processor with a Cray XD1) without any problem.

Renato, 

Are you are writing out 'C Binary' from a Fortran code?  
Which compiler are you using?  What type of machine and O/S?

Hello David

My knowledge/experience is that paraview only support Ensight C binary
Files... I would also love Ensight Fortran Binary support... However I have
no idea what the difference is between Fortran and C Binary files, so I use
ASCII for know (which is a waste of disk space and speed...)

Subject: [Paraview] AMR
Message-ID: <6.2.1.2.2.20050516130335.02daf3e0@pop.mcs.anl.gov>


I've written a reader of PARAMESH block-structured datasets (http://ct.gsfc.nasa.gov/paramesh/Users_manual/amr.html) that loads the data into vtkUnstructuredGrid.

(The PARAMESH data domains are divided into octrees whose octants are regular grids.)

I'd like to see if the new AMR structure you've been working on is suitable for these datasets.

1)  Is there documentation on it anywhere?
2)  At http://paraview.org/doc/nightly/html/classes.html, there are links to some "vtk*AMR*" classes.  Are some of these the ones that I should be using?
3)  Should I look at the source for these, or is the new AMR structure defined and manipulated somewhere else?


Thanks.


Randy Hudson.

Try this:

This should give you the memory usage for the dataset in Kbytes. This
works in parallel also. I am guessing for datasets of that size, the
processing is going be very slow unless you start running on a small

Let do a check list to find the problem:
1-I downloaded the latest binary, are you using the downloaded binary or 
the source?

2-when I type this in the prompt window:
[[[$Application 
GetMainWindow]GetCurrentPVSource]GetDataInformation]GetMemorySize
I get this
invalid command name "vtkTemp4GetCurrentPVSource"

What could be the difference? Any suggestions on what to try to find the 
problem?

OK I found your problem. I cut and copied your command and got the same
result as you. If you put spaces after the "]" everything works OK.

So: 

[[[$Application GetMainWindow] GetCurrentPVSource] GetDataInformation]
GetMemorySize

Works Ok but not:

[[[$Application
GetMainWindow]GetCurrentPVSource]GetDataInformation]GetMemorySize

 

I am sure the CVS build is OK.

 

For XP, I am using the CVS (last Friday's download).

Using the sphere as a source, the command below returns 4.

For Linux I am using today's CVS download, and the behavior is the same.

Works for me OK.

Let do a check list to find the problem:
1-I downloaded the latest binary, are you using the downloaded binary or the
source?

2-when I type this in the prompt window:
[[[$Application
GetMainWindow]GetCurrentPVSource]GetDataInformation]GetMemorySize
I get this
invalid command name "vtkTemp4GetCurrentPVSource"

What could be the difference? Any suggestions on what to try to find the
problem?

Hi Stephen,
 
Try this:
 
Load the 2M solution file, bring up the command prompt (Window ->
Command Prompt), in the command prompt type the following:
 
[[[$Application GetMainWindow] GetCurrentPVSource] GetDataInformation]
GetMemorySize
 
This should give you the memory usage for the dataset in Kbytes. This
works in parallel also. I am guessing for datasets of that size, the
processing is going be very slow unless you start running on a small
cluster.

I use v1.6 would that be the problem?

Subject: [Paraview] Re: General X window issue when running paraview server
Message-ID: <4289A621.00009F.31353@bjapp17>

There is a way about how to get X windows be opened when running
pvserver on a PC cluster.
If you use two pc as the pvserver, and the mpi can be run on the two pc, the only problem is you can?t run pvserver with tiled display.
Do the following step:
1)	if the two server PCs name is name1 and name2, and on the two PCs have the same user?s name is node1, and name1?s IP is 202.189.9.22, name2?s IP is 202.189.9.23, respectively
2)	On the Linux?s system of name1, under /home/node1 have a .bashrc file. You add two line like this  
 export DISPLAY=202.189.9.22:0.0  
          xhost +
The name2 PC configure like the PC1
 export DISPLAY=202.189.9.23:0.0  
          xhost +

Thanks Renato

You have showed me the way to write C Binary files with Fortran code...
character(LEN=80) :: buffer
open(unit=11,file='mai.geo',form='BINARY')
buffer="C Binary"
write(11) buffer

I was writting Fortran Binary files with Fortran Code
character(LEN=80) :: buffer
open(unit=11,file='mai.geo',form='UNFORMATTED')
buffer="Fortran Binary"
write(11) buffer


if you try both you will see the differrence...

form='BINARY' was not documeted in my fortran90 book... But seems to be 
supported by my compiler (PGI 5.1). Is this an extension to the fortran 
standards ???

This has been very useful since modification of my routines was minimal...

Many Thanks Andrew, works fine now.
I had tried previously:
[[[$Application GetMainWindow] GetCurrentPVSource] GetDatainformation] 
GetMemorySize
Object named: vtkTemp662, could not find requested method: 
GetDatainformation
or the method was called with incorrect arguments.
Looked like the space was there.

After your suggestion, I explicited added a space after each "]" and it 
worked fine.
[[[$Application GetMainWindow] GetCurrentPVSource] GetDataInformation] 
GetMemorySize
477010

So that means I am using approximately 1/2 Gbytes of memory.

Subject: [Paraview] annotating with time set values
Message-ID: <4289C19E.1030207@ifp.fr>

When I load a transient ensight case with several time values,  I can do 
animations based on these time values, but I haven't figured out how to 
print the time values to the screen during the animation. Is this 
possible in paraview ???

This was possible with ensight by using "Annotate" -> "Creat/Edit text 
strings" -> "Constant Variable" -> "Analysis_Time"

Thanks for your answers

Dear List Members -

We just received a new machine and I am planning to build a 64-bit version of ParaView on it; I looked through some of the ParaView and VTK archives but didn't see much specific advice except to use -fpic in the compiler flags and to build all libraries with these flags. I will be running with dual AMD Opterons under Fedora Core 3. 

Would anyone be willing to share their experience or advice for building ParaView and / or VTK on the x86-64 platform? I greatly appreciate any comments or suggestions you may have.

All the best, 
Ken

Message-ID: <20050517165610.E04C0355B0@public.kitware.com>


Hi all,

I'd like to know if there's any way to save some filter options. I used to
open files in Ensight binary format with Paraivew, but every time I open
this kind of file I have to change the "byte order" field to "little endian"
because the default is "big endian" and it's too boring when you have
several files to visualize.

Thanks for any help

I recently build paraview on Intel EMT. I encountered one compile
error (linker actually) while linking to MPICH I compiled myself. I
was linking against a static mpich library and the linker complained I
had to recompile mpich with fpic. When I linked against a shared
mpich, everything worked fine. I should note that I was building
paraview shared too. I did not try static.

Actually there is, although not very straightforward. Assuming you are
using ParaView 2.0 or older. Are you?

You will have to override the configuration built in paraview to
change the default values. Have you writting a paraview module before?
Do you have the paraview book?

No, unfortunately I have not written any Paraview module yet but I have the
Paraview's book (rev. 1.8) and already compiled Paraview in some machines.
Is it hard to implement?

I'll Second this. Anything you build yourself will be fine, because you 
can control the flags, but watch out for any third party libs you link 
against. I had a lot of trouble on a red hat box because it would link 
by default to everything in /usr/lib and I had to manually edit 
makefiles to link against /usr/lib64 in particular when running cmake, 
make sure you don't pick up the wrong libs in some of the X11R6/... 
directories and modify all the paths if necessary. I'm not sure how many 
distributions use lib and lib64 as distinct and different - but I found 
fedora core 3 was a lot of trouble in this respect. However if you know 
what you're doing (and I didn't because I'm new to linux), then you 
should be fine.

You shouldn't have to hack the makefiles, but I did find it necessary to add these to my cmake configuration:

CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS:STRING=-L/usr/lib64 -L/usr/X11R6/lib64
OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=/usr/lib64/libGL.so
OPENGL_glu_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=/usr/lib64/libGLU.so
X11_X11_LIB:FILEPATH=/usr/X11R6/lib64/libX11.so

That fixes most of my 64-bit Linux build problems. However, tk/.../wish doesn't get the message, and won't build properly unless you hack it's Makefile. Fortunately wish doesn't really matter, as it's not used for anything. See bug# 1823.

Some of these problems seem to be fixed on cvs cmake (which is what I
installed on the 64 bit machines). I was told there is going to be a
cmake release in the near future to fix these problems.

Hi all,

I'd like to know if there's any way to save some filter options. I used to
open files in Ensight binary format with Paraivew, but every time I open
this kind of file I have to change the "byte order" field to "little endian"
because the default is "big endian" and it's too boring when you have
several files to visualize.

Thanks for any help

Jean

Thanks a lot, I've just compiled Paraview and changed the byte order default
according to your tip.

I think it would be very useful if Paraview could read some initialization
or script file where users (or Paraview itself) could set some options in
the future...

If you know how to recompile the application, find the file called
readers.xml in the directory Servers/ServerManager/Resources in your own
file system

edit the file and look for the string EnSight

then a few lines below you will find these lines:

     <IntVectorProperty
        name="ByteOrder"
        command="SetByteOrder"
        number_of_elements="1"
        default_values="1" >
       <EnumerationDomain name="enum">
         <Entry value="0" text="BigEndian"/>
         <Entry value="1" text="LittleEndian"/>
       </EnumerationDomain>
     </IntVectorProperty>


just change the default value from 0 to 1 and recompile.

I'd like to be able to read and visualize, one after the other, several large data files.

In the tests I've done, using top to watch the memory allocation in pvserver, memory is not deallocated when I use either the "Delete" button of a data set's property sheet or the "Delete All Modules" item of the "Edit" menu.  This is true for input files, and for contour and cutting filters.

Is this the correct behavior?

Thanks.

This is not the expected behavior at all. I tested cvs head and 2.0.
It does not happen on head, only on 2.0.

Hi, all,
    I want to make GUI of Paraview support a new character set. For example, paraview system encoding list does not include Chinese ecoding (GB2312 or big5), and who can tell me how  I can insert this new ecoding into paraview and make its user interface display Chinese character?
    Thanks for any help!

Best,
Nancy

Hello,

is it possible to use the ITK-library together with the ParaView
application? I read something about a universal XML-interface?

Thanks

Subject: [Paraview] Trouble with Pipeline and image filters in ParaView
Message-ID: <428D97DF.7010807@cscs.ch>

I've been trying to get the LEA code working correctly with the new 
pipeline, but I seem to be having difficulty displaying correct output 
in Paraview. No matter what I set the output extent of the image to 
after processing an input, Paraview seems to somehow override my Extents 
and put the extent of the input image in the "information" tab of the 
display.

For example, input is 0-39 x 0-39, output should be 0-127 x 0-127, but 
paraview at first displays only a 0-39 square piece of the image. 
Interestingly, if I change display from Surface to outline, the outline 
jumps back to the correct size, then for a while, the information 
displayed changes (saying 0-127 correctly). Changing back to 
surface/outline/surface/outline causes the displayed image to change 
size each time back and forth between 39 and 128.

I've had a great deal of trouble getting anything sensible using imaging 
filters inside paraview and I wonder if there's something desperately 
broken deep inside it. (at least image filters that change the 
information = spacing/bounds/extents)

Has anyone got any advice? (next I'm going to wrap vtkImageShrink3D in 
xml and see if it also breaks Paraview).

thanks

JB

NB. vtkImageShrink3D also stuffs paraview up. (It's actually much worse, 
since it doesn't set any bounds or etxtent at all. At least I know the 
LEA code is not the problem)

The image filters all suffer from the same trouble of setting the output 
information, but this is never copied into the actual image object. I 
manually do this at the end of the RequestData call, but ImageShrink3D 
does not. Paraview can't see anything (especially as it probably isn't 
setting updateextent to wholeextent before executing the pipeline...)

ParaView is not internationalized. To do so is a lot of work.
Currently, we have no plans to take on such a task.

I'm new to the ParaView program and am having problems sizing my plots.  I'm trying to use the cube axes for reference, but when I scale up my picture in the actor controls the cube axes do not grow with them.  How do I tie them together so that whatever I do to the picture happens to the axes?

Message-ID: <d0606b2b05052012484d27d82@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everybody:

I have to use paraview to draw the output of a finite element program.
So far I'm writing xml files converting with a simple c++ routine the
input and output of the program. This method is anyway quite costly
from a computational point of view. Is there any other way to access
directly paraview database (to write files in its internal format). I
do not know if I expressed myself in a clear way... anyway, if you've
got any hint...

thanks and bye

The cube axes shows the bounds of the dataset, while the properties in 
the "Actor control" manipulate the actor geometry. Thus, changing the 
actor properties will not have any effect on the cube axes.
There is no way, presently, to tie the geomtry to the cube axes actor.

Hi Charles

I discovered this by looking at ensight furnished examples that worked 
in paraview, and this was the only difference I found... However the 
ensight documentation never said text lines should be stripped of 
leading whitespaces... And effectively ensight does not need them to be. 
Maybe this (allow leading whitespaces in text lines) needs to be added 
to the ensight reader for paraview...

Happy I could help.

Benjamin,

	Could you add this as a bug report for paraview(*). If possible add a 
sample ensight file that cannot be read properly.

Thanks,

You can apply the 'Transform' filter and then cube axes should work
fine.

Subject: [Paraview] Help,
 Problem in using mpi to run paraview on the Window xp?
Message-ID: <4291FDD5.000003.05645@bjapp15>

Hi all,
 
 On the Win xp,we use mpi to run paraview with two process, it's ok! 
When we use tiled display option on the client,  
it can read data from data server and can render the data normally on the client,
but it can't display in form of full-screen on the server.
What's wrong with it?
Is anyone can give me some advise?
Thanks for any help!

best regards
fhxie

Fhxie,

On the newer versions of paraview I think the tiled display options might be on the server side???

Can you describe in detail how you are running paraview? 
Command line options, how you start the mpi job, version of mpich,
what facility (service) is mpirun using to start paraview?

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview on Mac (Actually, on PPC ubuntu linux)
Message-ID: <11a2946f92b335c39d53f984487e0a08@mac.com>

Thanks to all the various hints and suggestions from the kind and 
knowledgeable members of this list I am very pleased to announce that I 
have finally got Paraview-2.0.2 running on my Mac!!

For reference:

Machine: Apple Mac (12" AlPB - PPC G4)

OS: Ubuntu linux 5.0.4 (Hoary Hedgehog - I have OS X Panther and ubuntu 
as dual boot so I have the best of both worlds.) - Ubuntu is a 
fantastic distro for those who haven't seen it. www.ubuntulinux.org You 
have to apt-get (or use synaptic) to install the build-essential files 
(gcc etc) and the various -dev packages with the development headers 
for X11 and the like (I can provide a complete list if needed). You 
have to activate the universe and multiverse repositories, but Synaptic 
makes this a simple tick in a check-box.

You can apt-get cmake from the debian repositories, but it builds 
easily from source, which is what I did.

Then I just followed the installation instructions for Paraview, with 
the one exception of running cmake interactively (cmake -i 
~/paraview-2.0.2), saying 'yes' to advanced options and changing the 
'build shared vtk libraries' option from 'OFF' to 'ON' then, make, 
(sudo) make install. Finally, (sudo) nano /etc/ld.so.conf to add the 
path /usr/local/paraview-2.0.2 to the list and (sudo) ldconfig to 
update the library search path.

If you don't want to (or can't) do the sudo install step then you don't 
need to worry about ld.so.conf or ldconfig, the executable finds the 
shared libraries in the build directory straight after the 'make' step 
(I tried)

I can now double-click the paraview executable in /usr/local/bin and it 
runs perfectly.

So, not exactly 'Paraview on OSX', but on PPC Mac at least, which is 
quite alright for me because the next step is to compile OpenFOAM, also 
on ubuntu...

Many thanks once again, especially to Kitware. I hope my small 
contribution here might be of use to others.

I may have missed earlier posts about getting Paraview to run on Mac  
OS X.  The last time I tried was 2.0.0 and, after some minor  
tweaking, successfully built/installed it.  It doesn't really do what  
I want (XYZ atom structure and motion visualization) so I haven't  
played with it much after that.  Has this been a problem and are  
people trying to do this?  If so, I wouldn't mind helping out.

Cheers,
Joe

Subject: [Paraview] Tiling configuration?
Message-ID: <1116956984.26234.28.camel@catan.zko.hp.com>

Hi, 
	I have a 2x2 tile display that I want to tile paraview (v2.0.1)
across. 

I am running in client/server mode, with 4 servers running in an MPI job
within a cluster, and a single client running outside the cluster.

Servers are launched with the following: 

/opt/hpmpi/bin/mpirun -e DISPLAY=:0 -srun -w
"tigger3,tigger4,tigger5,tigger6" pvserver -rc --client-host=catan -
tdx=2 -tdy=2

The client is launched with the following:
env PV_SEPERATE_RENDER_WINDOW=1 ./pvclient --reverse-connection -tdx=2 -
tdy=2

Visualization works fine, but, unfortunately, the tile order is messed
up. The visualization on each of the tiles looks right, but the
tiles are in the completely wrong order. (It kinda looks like a messed-
up sliding-block puzzle. )

How do I tell paraview the layout of tiles? 

I've seen some reference to a pvx file, but it is not documented (that I
could find) in the book. 

Any help is greatly appreciated. 

Thanks,
--Phil

If I am not mistaken your tile should be like this:

mpi_node_1   mpi_node_2
mpi_node_3   mpi_node_4

If you change your host configuration according to this, it should
work properly. I don't know that you can configure where each node
goes in the configuration file.

Hi Phil,

Which machines are displaying their results on which tile?

The first machine in the list you pass to MPI is used as the upper left 
tile.  Subsequent machines fill in a single row, and then the rows are 
filled from top to bottom.  For your 2 x 2 tiled display to give the 
appropriate results, the machines should be controlling the tiles as shown 
below:

tigger3 tigger4
tigger5 tigger6

This issue is the same regardless of whether you use a .pvx file.

This mapping can not be changed within a configuration file? 

Something like (which would reverse the order of the tiles): 

mpi_node_id     tile_id
-----------------------
0                  3
1                  2
2                  1
3                  0

...

It looks like if I can whip my MPI job launch into shape, I can work
around this. (I am by no means an MPI expect, and I am looking into how
to solve this.)  I haven't yet figured out how to use mpirun to specify
the exact order of nodes...  When I reverse list,
(tigger6,tigger5,tigger4,tigger3) the MPI ranks are the same as when I
launch it with (tigger3,tigger4,tigger5,tigger6).

In any event, I was hoping that we could use paraview to set the tile
layout.  However, it looks like I have to make mpirun put the correct
MPI ranks on the proper display tiles.   I'll attack that. 

Thanks for the help, 
--Phil

This is the first mpi implementation that does not use the same order
the user specifies. As far as I know, this can't be done in the
configuration file, sorry. I don't even know if Ice-T lets one do
this. If it does, adding something to the configuration file wouldn't
be too hard.

It is very possible that I am using it wrong (or found a bug).  I'm
going to ask around inside of HP to figure out what's going on.

Thanks for the help,

Further to the questions about Tiling, if stereo support was enabled on 
each node - in principle a large stereo screen would be possible -

if using CrystalEyes stereo glasses
1) Would the V-sync of each monitor need to be synchronized
2) If so is there an easy way to do this?
3) If not, is there some other way to do this?

thanks

John,
	I believe that you would have to have graphics cards with
Genlock/Framelock.  (or the add-on board)

You would set up the sync outside of paraview.  On Linux, Nvidia
provides a utility for their cards which allows you to set up which
groups of nodes need to be synchronized. (NOTE: You need to have the
specialized graphics hardware which supports this.)

Subject: [Paraview] Ensight reader : Multiple Parts seem to be treated as a
	whole,
	therefore losing the possibility to manipulate them independantly
Message-ID: <4295E51B.2060604@ifp.fr>

   Hello

When loading an Ensight gold case containing multiple unstructured 
parts, here are the problems I have.

1) Since I have multiple parts, I would like to view them independently 
or color them independently (As ensight can do it.). However in 
paraview, they are all treated as a global entity. Am I doing something 
wrong or is this normal (yet non convenient [since we lose the parts]) 
behavior ???

2) To view droplets, I use point elements. However they only display as 
squares... I would like spheres (better image for a droplet...) is this 
possible ???
    Since my droplets are only points why should it be necessary to use 
a "point" section (i.e. nodes should be enough for viewing points 
["coordinates" section in ensight], we are writing the information in 
the file twice... By the way ensight80 does not require the "point" section)

Thanks for you replies.

Benjamin

Use the "Extract Parts" filter (in the Filter menu) to separate out the 
various parts of your multi-part data set.

To see your points as spheres, you can apply a glyph filter to your data 
set and set the Glyph to Sphere0 (from the menu below the Accept button on 
the Parameters page for the Glyph filter).

Thanks Amy, the filter and the glyphs did it for me !

Is there a way to configure paraview so that it allways extracts each 
part independently apart from saving a script file ?

Create a 'Lookmark' and then uncheck 'Lock to Dataset' :)

That way you can invoke the same sequence of operations on different datasets.

Hello,

I tried the --stereo option for paraview and it works on my linux
computer without a problem. On Windows XP it doesn't work (command line
option is correctly processed). Another VTK program is working with the
stereo rendering. Can anybody help me?

Thanks Jan

P.S.: I'm using ParaView 2.0.2 with MS VS 2003 on WinXP SP2

Hello,

I use paraview to read Legacy VTK.
All the point and cell values are correctly load in paraview.

But in the same VTK file I have the time information in a scalar field and I would like to know
where in the paraview sources, this value is read ?

Thank you for your help.

Hi everybody:
  I am using paraview to display the output of a finite element
program. I need to write the xml file and I'd rather use the binary
format to input the points of the mesh. I am using C++. The question
is: I have a vector with the coordinates of the points and I have to
put it in the xml file. Has any of you faced a similar situation?

Giuseppe,

	There is an ongoing effort to have both a C and fortran interface to 
write VTK XML files. This will require VTK CVS if you are interested, 
for more information, have a look at:

VTK/IO/Testing/Cxx/
                   TestXMLCInterface.c
                   vtkFortran.h
                   vtkXMLCInterface.cxx
                   vtkXMLCInterface.h


	Please keep in mind that this was comited only today and might require 
a few iterations to stabilize.

Comments very welcome

Hi, all,
     I am reading the source code of paraview, and want to understand the message passing scheme in paraview.
For example, when I push a button or choose an item in the menu on the client GUI, how this event is passed to the final related processing Class object?
I can only find the begin end of the source code (e.g. create a menu item) and the final class of processing (e.g. a reader/source class), but I can not track the message passing process between the begin end and final methods of related class.
    Who can give me an answer?   Thanks for any help!

Best,
Nancy

The times values are not associated with points or cells, I am
assuming. Are they associated with the field data? A snippet of what
the file would look like in ASCII would be helpful.

The paraview architecture is a wee bit to complicated to describe in
an e-mail. The ParaView Guide explains it some. In short:

1. The gui elements make calls on an (C++) API called "server manager"
2. The server manager translates these into a stream that can be sent
over the network
3. An interpreter receives these streams, parses them and converts
them into C++ calls.

Instead of using something like CORBA, we developed a very simple and
light layer that is automatically generated at compile time (generated
pretty much the same way Tcl, Python and Java wrappers are generated
for VTK automatically).

Message-ID: <BAY107-F18DEC279BB17F880378B2D87040@phx.gbl>

To Whom It May Concern,

I am using Paraview to read-in a XDMF file with .h5 data file (as it is 
"heavy" data) and I keep getting a segmentation fault.  The file I am 
reading in is pretty big with 29,171 Nodes and 58,187 triangular elements.

Has anyone ran into this problem? I am thinking that the file may be too big 
but am unsure. Below is the contents of "ParaView" trace file:

58,187 elements are not that many. I seriously doubt that the size is
the issue (unless you have an ancient computer with very little
memory, but then I doubt paraview would run properly). Can you
generate a stack trace? Or write a bug report and upload the data at:
http://www.paraview.org/Bug

Subject: [Paraview] Parallel Load/Rendering of Polygon Data
Message-ID: <1117565509.21781.77.camel@catan.zko.hp.com>

Hi All,

	I have a large polygon model (2.5 gig) that I want to view within
paraview.  Individually, each of the nodes do not have enough memory (2
gig) to load the model, however, in parallel, they should have enough.
I've tried several different ways to load and render my model in
parallel without success....

Questions:
	1) Does paraview provide way to load and render this polygon
	   data in parallel, with each node loading and rendering a
	   subset of the data? 

	If I:
		A) load another relatively large model, 
		B) split it across many nodes, 
		C) use "map process id to color"

	The image appears on the screen with a series of horizontal
	bands. This is as if each of the nodes had all of the polygons,
	but only drew a band of it. (Sort-last)

	I would prefer that each node loaded and drew a different subset
        of the geometry and then depth-composited it together.
	
	(At first, round robin selection of polygons would be just
         fine..)

	Does paraview support this?  If not, where would I look to add
	the round-round loading/rendering of polygon data?

	2) What file format should I save the polygon data in? 
		
	I've used a single 4-gig x86_64 node to convert it from VRML 2.0
	to a 'pvd' file.  However, the 'pvd' file only has one
        piece, "lucy_0.vtp".  When I try to load it on many (8) 2-gig
	nodes in parallel, they each run out of memory.  

	When I load the model on the single 4-gig node, the RSS of 
	paraview is ~2.5 gig.  As a result, I would expect an 8 way run
        of paraview to each be 300M... That isn't the case.  (Yes, I
        know that things don't scale like that, but each node should
        not require more than 1 gig...)

	What is the right file format to use for parallel loading?  How
	should I generate this file from VRML data? 

NOTE: I'd had success loading/parallizing raw data across many nodes,
but polygon data doesn't seem to work.  However, I may not have reached
the single-node memory threshold....


Thanks in advance,

Subject: [Paraview] Can Use Cell Data to Color Cut of Unstr Grid in 2.0.2?
Message-ID: <155EBFC5D04CA4C0B727D095@harpo.psc.edu>

Unless I have lost my mind, version 2.0.1 could use cell data to color an 
implicit cut plane of an unstructed grid. In 2.0.2, it seems to work except 
that the plane is always a solid color. I don't have 2.0.1 around for 
comparison. A bug?

Built from source on Fedora Core 3 (Intel).

Thanks

Phillip,

I have had some success with *.pvtu file sets.
The aaa.pvtu (or in your case it would be aaa.pvtp) 
is a "mother" file that references all of the polygon
subsets into which the parent aaa.vrml has been
"decomposed," that is, aaa.001.vtp,...,aaa.00n.vtp
is a sequence of smaller, component files that
represent the entire polygon set. Each of the subdomain
*.vtp files must be displayable in its own right by ParaView.

I have attached a typical (for me) aaa.vtpu file as an example.
In this example, the "parallel subdomains" are three separate
material regions (m001,m002,m003). ParaView doesn't
care whether you created them from a serial run or a 
parallel run; all PV needs to know is that you want to display
all of *.vtu files and you want to think of the set as the entire 
model. (If your vrml file has a bunch of individual items, this
is also a handy way to display selectively each item, provided
you can conviently split your vrml data set.)

I hope this helps to parallel process your 2.5 gig data set.

Regards,

Sam Key

Phillip,

I don't know the exact right file format for loading polygonal data in
parallel, but I think Sam is on the right track.

If you want to load balance the data once it is in you can use the D3
filter. :)

Also for the short term if you can 'squeeze' the dataset on one node you
can use D3 to take data from 1 processor and send data to all the
others. Then save the dataset out as a pvtp file. You will now have
parallel files !

You can then load these up in paraview and they will be nicely load
balanced.

You could even do something like

Load up on a 2 proc machine with 4 Gig memory save out 2 files then
start up a cluster job on those two files and split again and save 16
files or whatever.... How's that for goofy!
