Does anyone have any experience modifying the Paraview source to use the
CAVElib for rendering? Theoretically, it should be possible with the
vtkActorToPerformer class. What I need to do is find out where in the
Paraview source code the rendering or mapping calls to VTK are made and make
appropriate calls to the vtkActorToPerformer object instead. A separate loop
will handle the rendering using OpenGL Performer and the CAVElib. Any help
and/or ideas would be greatly appreciated.

Hello Steven,

I do not have much experience using VTK and CAVELib, but I assume that 
there are special vtkMapper, vtkActor or vtkRenderers which do this.  You 
should be able to add these special subclasses in ParaView and make it 
work.  All of these objects are created through Tcl calls, so It should be 
easy to make the substitution.  If you are not using MPI, then ParaView 
skips creating the composite manager, so you do not need to worry about that.

The renderer/render window is created in vtkPVRenderView in the 
"CreateRenderObjects" method.

The actor and mapper are created in vtkPVData in release 0.6, but are 
created in vtkPVPart in the nightly CVS repository.

There is an environment variable (PV_SEPARATE_RENDER_WINDOW) that when set 
causes the render window and the UI  to be in separate windows.  You may 
need this option.

Charles.

Jean,

Thanks for the feedback.  I am currently extending ParaView so that 
multiple vtkDataSets can be processed as one.  I just need to get all of 
the regression tests working before I check it in.  All parts in an ensight 
file will be loaded as one "PVSource/PVData".  This even handles 
heterogeneous data types.  There will be no support for ghost cells between 
parts in a group (connectivity between parts).

I have not decided on an interface for creating new groups, or for 
splitting groups.  For extracting parts of a group, I envision a long list 
of check boxes with additional options to select/de select all parts at 
once or parts of a certain type (i.e. vtkPolyData).

It would also be nice to control visibility of sub parts without having to 
extract them.  This option will have to wait for a while.

For your fish model, (in the near future) you will be able the load the 
whole data set as one object.  Turns its visibility off.  Extract the 201st 
part. Turns its visibility on.

Charles, thanks for your input.

In EnSight, selection of a subset of many parts can be done with the usual 
combinations of mouse clicks (select with Left Mouse Button (LMB), followed by 
Ctrl-LMB, or Shift-LMB). My first reaction to check boxes is that it would be 
very cumbersome for long lists of parts. In CFD, the models I use daily are 
between 200 and 1000 parts. I know others use up to 5000 parts...

Additionally, selection can be done by names, using the standard wildcard ? and 
*. This is particularly useful when the names of the parts encode some property 
of the part, as for example a Flow Boundary Condition. One can then select at 
once all the parts representing a special flow or geometric property.

Just a few ideas. I am ready to test some preliminary implementations and give 
you more feedback.

Thanks.
Jean

Subject: [Paraview] configuration file for tiled display?
Message-ID: <3E1D8C72.ADCE4608@cscs.ch>

Hello

I'd like to run ParaView (CVS version) on an SGI 3-pipe with 3 curved
displays attached together in an hemispheric screen. 

Problem is I cannot find out how the configuration should be defined. I
have used 2 other viz softwares and I was used to defining a small ASCII
file with each display's config.

Would someone have an example or some hands-on tips on how to do it?

TIA.

Jean,

ParaView does have a simple option to use tiled displays, but I have not 
added the ability to define the displays in a configuration file 
yet.  ParaView assumes that the displays are coplanar so I do not know how 
the hemispheric display would look.  Display arrangement could be much more 
flexible if we added a configuration file.

For now, you control the display configuration with command line options:

--use-tiled-display --tile-dimension-x=3 --tile-dimension-y=1

You would have to start ParaView with 4 processes.  The user interface is 
shown in processes 1 and the other three processes render to the tiled 
displays.


There is also no support (currently) for specifying which Xdisplay to 
use.  This could also be added to a configuration file.


Charles.

At the risk of getting dirty looks on this list ;-) I suggest that if
you can get VTK-Python working on OSX you can give MayaVi
(http://mayavi.sf.net) a shot.  It should also serve as a reasonable
front end to VTK.

At the risk of getting dirty looks on this list ;-) I suggest that if
you can get VTK-Python working on OSX you can give MayaVi
(http://mayavi.sf.net) a shot.  It should also serve as a reasonable
front end to VTK.

Hello, I am a first time poster and new to ParaView.

    I am trying to comile ParaView to run on a Linux 7.3 cluster.  The =
reason I am comiling is I need to take advantage of the Mesa offscreen =
rendering.  My questions are:

    1.     Is all I need to do is turn on the use Mesa option (and =
location of the library and header file) or do I also need to enable the =
mangling option?  If I turn just the mesa option and compile the binary =
still does not seem to like the -r option from the command line (it says =
its not recognized).  I can't really test the offscreen with just the =
PV_OFFSCREEN environment variable set because of question 2.

    2.     After comiling and running the new binary there are not any =
of the XML file types in the file | open dialog box.  How can I get =
these to appear?  I am trying to load a pvti file with its associated =
vti files and ParaView says it is an unrecognized file type (they do =
work in the binaries downloaded from the web site).

    Thank you in advance for any help on these options....

Hi Steven, Charles,

Unfortunately, there's a little bit more you need to be able to use
Vtk/ParaView with CAVElib, especially in multi-piped/walled
configurations.

The problem is that display processes in CAVElib versions prior to 3.x
need shared memory to access the geometry that is to be rendered by
the different pipes. This would either require that vtkMapper and
Actor are changed so they allocate from shared mem (instead of heap),
or copying geometry into shared mem. The latter is what
vtkActorToPerformer does (and vtk2CAVE as well, by Matthew Hall).

You can probably imagine that the overhead in copying can kill
performance, especially if visualization pipelines re-execute
frequently. Also; on some systems shared memory is a limited resource;
on Linux systems for example, this is 32MB by default (cat
/proc/sys/kernel/shmmax), which isn't a lot if you're rendering
complex scenes...

Version 3.x of CAVElib gives you the option of using display *threads*
instead of (forked) processes. This allows display processes to access
memory from heap, thereby solving (most) of these problems.

We have implemented CAVElib 3.x versions of vtkActor, vtkRenderer,
RenderWindow, RenderWindowInteractor, and more, but haven't really had
a time to fully test this on systems other than our single-walled
Linux-based VR system.

If there is a need, we would be willing to share our code. But again;
note that this software requires CAVElib version 3.x.

Best,
-- Rob

I don't know what the first error is. I guess it is the NVIDIA drivers
telling that they don't like the dynamic loader you are using, this
has nothing to do with ParaView. However, this is not why ParaView
is not running. It is not running because your 2nd process does not
get a DISPLAY variable and it can't figure out where to display it's
window. Depending on your MPI implementation and the shell you are
using, there are different ways of setting this. Some MPI 
implementations allow specifying env. variables on the command line
while with others you have to specify it in a startup file such as
.bashrc.

Hi Tim,

1. Are you trying to mix Mesa (for off-screen rendering) and hardware
accelerated OpenGL (for on-screen rendering) or to simply switch to
using Mesa for both ? 

2. When creating the binaries, I hacked the build a little to include
the xml readers (normally, they are optional). If you want, I can
send the distribution I used (the modifications are a little
complicated to describe here).

Berk,

1.  Right now I am trying for the simplest way for reliably getting the
system to work so probably straight Mesa.  I only want  the master window to
get displayed (using a Linux environment cluster).

2.  The distribution would be very helpfull, thank you!  You can send it
directly to me or I can pull from somewhere.  What does Kitware do for their
build procedures to make the binaries that they distribute?  Is there a
reference in vtk that would explain the procedures you took or is it
ParaView specific?

Thank you for your help!

Tim

I'm trying to build Paraview from cvs with cmake 1.6. I'm running Red

I had to set the backwards_compatibility to 1.4 because I was getting
this error numerous times:

1.4 and will be removed in later versions of CMake. You should modify
your CMakeLists.txt files to use the SET command instead, or set the

----------

and this one aswell:

I still get another error when backward_compatibility to 1.4 numerous
times, should these really be happening???

Hi,

After some unsuccessfull tries with the CVS version of Paraview and
MPICH, I got ParaView06 to compile with LAM-MPI libraries on a Linux
cluster.

Trying to run it in parallel mode, it started to run (I got the ParaView
graphical loading widget), then decided it had better not... Here is the
output :

$mpirun -v -lamd -np 2 ./bin/paraview06/bin/ParaView
32268 ./bin/paraview06/bin/ParaView running on n0 (o)
1488 ./bin/paraview06/bin/ParaView running on n1

Rank (0, MPI_COMM_WORLD): Call stack within LAM:
Rank (0, MPI_COMM_WORLD):  - MPI_Send()
Rank (0, MPI_COMM_WORLD):  - main()

  From the previous mails about parallel mode, I thought it might be a
DISPLAY environment variable problem. So I ran the same process on a
biprocessor system, and got a similar problem :

$mpirun -v -lamd -np 2 ./bin/PV06/bin/ParaView
22845 ./bin/PV06/bin/ParaView running on n0 (o)
22846 ./bin/PV06/bin/ParaView running on n0 (o)

Rank (1, MPI_COMM_WORLD): Call stack within LAM:
Rank (1, MPI_COMM_WORLD):  - MPI_Recv()
Rank (1, MPI_COMM_WORLD):  - main()
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

One of the processes started by mpirun has exited with a nonzero exit
code.  This typically indicates that the process finished in error.
If your process did not finish in error, be sure to include a "return
0" or "exit(0)" in your C code before exiting the application.

PID 22845 failed on node n0 with exit status 1.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thanks in advance for any hints at what the problem might be.

When you say "ParaView from cvs", do you mean the release branch 
(ParaView-0-6) or the development ? Also, do you use ParaViewComplete
or separate VTK and ParaView trees ?

This is a work-around for older gnu compilers. If you are using gcc 3.0
or older, you should set VTK_USE_ANSI_STDLIB CMake (advanced) setting  
to ON. In the future, this setting will be on by default.

I think its the development branch, ParaViewComplete; I did the one of
the webpage:
"cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@public.kitware.com:/cvsroot/ParaView co -r
ParaView-0-6 ParaViewComplete"

I just checked my version of gcc, its 3.2; doesn't this mean it should 
built without error???

Anyways, I did ccmake with VTK_US_ANSI_STDLIB=ON this time and
everything built fine. But when it came to doing make install, I got an
error saying vtkRender.h not found, so I took a look into
"ParaViewComplete/VTK/Rendering" and saw everything was named Rendering
and not Render, so I changed vtkRender.h to vtkRendering.h the rest
installed fine. Could this be a bug???

There was some other error about CMakeCache.txt not found and I forgot 
now how I fixed it but I think I copied the one over from the
ParaViewComplete to the VTK directory.

Subject: [Paraview] mpi + pvtk = tcl/tk errors ?
Message-ID: <000001c2c941$6162fe50$81a8a8c0@ostrouchov2>

Hello,

I'm trying to run paraview/pvtk on a 4 node cluster (Redhat 7.2), using
mpich 1.2.4.  
I'm not the sysadmin, so ParaView/pvtk is not installed on each node,
but in my home area (which is cross mounted on all nodes). 

If I run the following script through vtk on the head node, there are no
errors.

# ParaView Version 0.6

package require vtkio
package require vtkrendering
package require vtkparallel
puts "Success"
exit

As you can see, the script isn't very complicated.

On any other node, running the script produces:

no display name and no $DISPLAY environment variable
::vtk::load_component: tk could not be found.
can't find package Tk
Tk was not found: the VTK rendering package can not be used... Please
check that your Tcl/Tk installation is correct. Windows users should
also check that the program used to open/execute Tcl files is the Tk
shell (wish), not the Tcl shell (tclsh).
can't find package vtkrendering
    while executing
"package require vtkrendering"
    (file "check.tcl" line 4)

I've attempted to solve the problem by moving all executables and
libraries to all nodes, but the same error occurs (all nodes are
identical).  I've also added:
"wm withdraw ." as the first execution line, but then vtk fails with:

Application initialization failed: no display name and no $DISPLAY
environment variable
Error in startup script: invalid command name "wm"
    while executing
"wm withdraw ."
    (file "check.tcl" line 2)

The child nodes are on a private network, and not world accessible.
(The head node has 2 nics, one for world, one for the private network.)

I've verified that wish and tclsh exist on all machines.  (In fact, both
wish and tclsh run the above script fine on the head node.)

I've attempted to do X11 forwarding from the child nodes.  I've tried
setting the DISPLAY environment var, but nothing seems to work.

I imagine at least one person is asking where the mpi problem is.  When
I began trying to run pvtk, I was using:
mpirun -np 4 -machinefile ~/machines pvtk [script]
The system would puke, giving an error similar to the above three times.
That is when I began attempting to run a smaller script on each node.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

This is a common problem. Your slave nodes are not getting the DISPLAY
variable. Depending on your configuration and your mpi launcher, you
need to find the right way of letting the know where to display. I
usually do this by setting the DISPLAY var. in a login file, i.e my
.bashrc has the following line

export DISPLAY=:0

Of course, this is not an ideal solution since it disables X11 
forwarding through ssh etc. but since I don't use the cluster for
anything other than running ParaView, I don't care. If you want
all the display to go somewhere else, replace :0 with whatever
is appropriate. Of course, you also have to set the display access
properly using xhost or xauth or something. If the mpich you
are using is configured to use mpd, the following might work:

mpirun -np 4 -machinefile ~/machines pvtk [script] -MPDENV- DISPLAY=:0

Unfortunately, setting the display to :0 did not work.  The error is
below.

Application initialization failed: couldn't connect to display ":0"
::vtk::load_component: tk could not be found.
can't find package Tk
Tk was not found: the VTK rendering package can not be used... Please
check that your Tcl/Tk installation is correct. Windows users should
also check that the program used to open/execute Tcl files is the Tk
shell (wish), not the Tcl shell (tclsh).
Error in startup script: can't find package vtkrendering
    while executing
"package require vtkrendering"
    (file "check.tcl" line 3)

If I ssh -X into the machine, everything runs fine (some X libs were
moved onto all nodes).  It still does not work with mpi, though.  I've
even changed my mpirun script to have ssh -X instead of ssh.

Any other ideas?
Thanks in advance.

I've solved the problem.  I needed to enable ssh x11 forwarding in a ssh
config file.  Works fine now.

Thanks for your help.

Cool. I still think it would be better if you could enable
local display on each node (i.e. using DISPLAY=:0). After all,
unless you are doing off-screen rendering, x11 forwarding will
comsume bandwidth.
