Paraview is really great.
 
But I think it also have some shortcomings.It has not enough data readers for engineering analysis.It can't support animation for vector field visualization(not transient data) too.
 
Paraview using splt frame packing mechanism is so weird. I don't know if it support fullscreen.
And if I want to attach the VR device, What should we do?

I agree. We hope that with time people will contribute more readers
to ParaView (or VTK). Our current priority is to implement readers used
by our customers.

This will be in ParaView in the future. I don't know how soon though.

Sure it does. You can either run ParaView with a detach 3D window
or in client-server mode. 

> And if I want to attach the VR device, What should we do?

ParaView has extensive support for large displays. It has two built
in powerwall options: Ice-T and native. It is also possible to use
Chromium with ParaView. Stereo support for Ice-T is in the works. 
It is, of course, possible to modify the source code to make it work
with a particular VR device.

Hello List

setting PV_INTERFACE_PATH to a user-defined XML file including a local 
library works very well in the 1.0.4 version. I also have set 
LD_LIBRARY_PATH and TCLLIBPATH and my local lib is loaded without any 
problems in v 1.0.4.

Using the same 3 env. variables but switching to the cvs dev version of 
paraview, I get parsing errors which I do not know how to solve. Has the 
  <Library name=""/> syntax been changed?


Here is my XML file:

<ModuleInterfaces>
<Library name="vtkLocalTCL"/>
  <Module name="MCOMmb" root_name="mcommb"
    output="vtkPolyData"
    class="vtkPVAdvancedReaderModule" module_type="Reader"
    extensions=".db" file_description="Multi-Block Structured Files">
   <Source class="vtkMCOMMultiBlockReader"/>
   <ArraySelection trace_name="point_array_sel" attribute_name="Point"/>
   </Module>
</ModuleInterfaces>

and the error message:


ErrorMessage
# Error or warning: ERROR: In 
/local/apps/ParaView/ParaView/vtkPVXMLPackageParser.cxx, line 662
vtkPVXMLPackageParser (0x8331d80): Error loading Library component

ErrorMessage end

Thanks for the help.

The syntax did not change. However, we are no longer using Tcl as the
communication language between ParaView client and server 
(client/server design is also used when running as a single process).
We are using a simple wrapping layer that is binary (no more converting
float arguments to strings and strings to float) and more compact. This
requires that you create wrappers for your library.  I will let Brad
describe how you can do that since I have little experience with it
so far.

I'll have to setup some new support in the new client/server wrappers to
build them for external packages.  Hopefully I will get this done in the
next couple of days.

hi,

I noticed the paraview is convient to add the reader, writer, filter new
class just by write the xml deploy descriptor. however, I want to add
the "vtkLinearTransform", "vtkLandmarkTransform",
"vtkThinPlateSplineTransform" to paraview, how could I do this work?

any hint will be great appreciated.

This is now implemented.  A third-party project can build a ParaView
plugin using CMake code like this:

-----------------------------------------------------------------
PROJECT(MYPACKAGE)
INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES(${MYPACKAGE_SOURCE_DIR})

# Import ParaView build settings.
FIND_PACKAGE(ParaView)
IF(ParaView_FOUND)
  INCLUDE(${PARAVIEW_USE_FILE})
ELSE(ParaView_FOUND)
  MESSAGE(FATAL_ERROR "ParaView is required.  Set ParaView_DIR.")
ENDIF(ParaView_FOUND)

# List of classes for the plugin.
SET(mypackage_SRCS vtkMyClass.cxx)

# Create vtk client/server wrappers for the classes.
VTK_WRAP_ClientServer(mypackage mypackageCS_SRCS ${mypackage_SRCS})

# Build the package as a plugin for ParaView.
ADD_LIBRARY(mypackage MODULE ${mypackage_SRCS} ${mypackageCS_SRCS})
TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES(mypackage vtkClientServer)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Then you can write an XML package configuration file like this:

<ModuleInterfaces>
 <Library name="mypackage"/>
 <!-- ... describe interfaces here ... -->
</ModuleInterfaces>

Message-ID: <400BCF4A.919A99C0@sophia.inria.fr>

1-I start ParaView and create an iso contour which I animate. I stop the
animation and save the session.pvs file and the session.tcl files. When
I restart ParaPview and load the session.pvs file, the contour animation
starts in the cycle mode with no button to stop it (the stop button is
not highlighted). Question: How does one stop the animation?

2-I have the session.tcl script, how does one use it?

3-I have 40+ sets of data (time-dependent output). Question: How can I
run ParaView in the batch mode to load the data, save an image at each
time step. ParaView in used in the sequential mode.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.58.0401271421220.13433@champion.cs.uchicago.edu>

When building ParaView on Mac OSx, I get the recurring error:

Building object file vtkExtractCells.o...
/Developer/ParaViewComplete/ParaView/Filters/vtkExtractCells.cxx: In
member
   function `void vtkExtractCells::CopyCellsUnstructuredGrid(vtkIdList*)':
/Developer/ParaViewComplete/ParaView/Filters/vtkExtractCells.cxx:471:
error: no
   matching function for call to `vtkUnstructuredGrid::SetCells(

/usr/local/include/vtk/vtkUnstructuredGrid.h:98: error:
void
   vtkUnstructuredGrid::SetCells(vtkUnsignedCharArray*, vtkIntArray*,
   vtkCellArray*)


This makes it seem like there is a problem in the actual source.  Those
stray &'s in the code.  To make sure this wasn't a fluke, I have tested
this using the ParaView CVS, ParaViewComplete CVS, and
paraview-1.0.4.tar.gz

All of them give me the same error.

For background on my setup,
I am running Mac OS 10.2.7, have fink installed, and using that, installed
python2.3, tcltk, and hdf5 using fink.  I installed VTK using the nightly
sources using the Hybrid/X11 rendering along with python and tcl wrapping.

I can include the CMakeCache.txt files if needed.

Thanks
Dave

Try getting the ParaView-1-2 branch from CVS (make sure you get
ParaViewComplete).
