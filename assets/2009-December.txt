Ok it works but there is a mistake in this page: http://paraview.org/OnlineHelpCurrent/LegacyVTKFileReader.html
since the name of the class is mentionned as "LegacyVTKFileReader"

Suppose I have a filter that can process only a limited set of file types: I would like to test the actual type of a file before applying the filter, so I try this:

  data = reader.GetDataInformation()
  data.IsA("vtkImageData")

which actually returns always 0, so I probably did not use the right method.

If a apply CleanToGrid to a dataset with several scalar and vector point data, I get an unstructured grid with all the associated variables.
But if I apply the same process in Python, only 1 scalar and 1 vector data are sent to the resulting dataset.
How to ask CleanToGrid to include all associated data?

I don't think that what you are describing is possible. That filter
does not have an option to process fewer than all of the arrays. Can
you tell us how to reproduce it?

Try

Are you sure your client and server are of the same version? The error

Hi Ken,

How does Paraview's tiled panel display support fit into this? Am I right in assuming that in that case (without offscreen-rendering) the pvservers send image output to the client, where a  composited image is displayed? Or is the client also doing local rendering of geometry sent to it from the servers?

Regards,
Paul

That is correct with two clarifications:

The ?with ?use-offscreen-rendering? explanation is only correct for when ParaView is compiled with OSMesa.

The ?without ?use-offscreen-rendering? behavior only happens because the servers try to open X windows and fail.

Dear all,

so based on the timer log results that i collected, what i read about offscreen-rendering and the explanation below, can i conclude the followings? someone pls correct me if i'm wrong!

with --use-offscreen-rendering

 *   X windows are disabled on all server processes
 *   all server processes render the geometry locally
 *   then each server processes sends the image to the client for compositing
 *   there's NO data gathering to process 0, meaning the master doesn't collect all images from each processes for composting, then only send it to the client for rendering
 *   that's why --use-offscreen-rendering is faster


without --use-offscreen-rendering

 *   X windows are enabled on all server processes
 *   all server processes the raw data, then send all geometry to process 0
 *   process 0 gather all geometry then send them to the client to render
 *   the client does all the rendering job
 *   that's why without --use-offscreen-rendering is slower


any help / reply is highly appreciated

hi chew ping?
  The Problem:"Display is not accessible on the server side. Remote rendering will be disabled.", it means that not all server start up X Server, so the server will process the raw data and send all geometry to the client to render.
  The client do all the rendering job, that's the reason why case 2 is so slow, I think.
  When you use off screen, all server processes render the geometry locally , send image to client to composite, so case 1 much faster than case 2.
  I hope this can help you, for I got the same problem before. Good luck.

Unlike Case 2, Case 1 does not show any 'Dataserver gathering to 0' or 'Dataserver sending to client'
so i guess what makes Case 2 slower is because the vtkMPIMoveData is doing extra thing to move data amongst processes

btw, whenever i run it without -offscreen-rendering, i get this message:
"Display is not accessible on the server side. Remote rendering will be disabled."

based on what i read from paraview tutorial, what i understand is that the parallel rendering algorithm allows each process to independently render its partition of the geometry and then composites the partial images together to form the final image. Is this what happened in Case 2 because it has 'Datas erver gathering to 0' or 'Dataserver sending to client'?

actually what i dont understand is why case 2 is much slower than case 1?
is it because different 'things' are going on in the processes when offscreen-rendering is on/off?


any help / reply is highly appreciated

Best Regards,
chewping

In tiled display mode all parallel image compositing goes to the tiled display.  The rendering that happens on the client is local.  Yes, that means that the geometry must be sent to the client.  Generally, the decimated geometry of the interactive LOD is all that is sent (unless the data is really small).  So in a sense, the you see only interactive renders on the client.  You have to look at the tiled display to see the full detail (which is the point of having the tiled display in the first place, right?).  If even the decimated geometry is too big (which can happen if the rendering server has lots of processes), then the client will just show a bounding box in proxy of the actual geometry.

Hi Ken,

How does Paraview's tiled panel display support fit into this? Am I right in assuming that in that case (without offscreen-rendering) the pvservers send image output to the client, where a  composited image is displayed? Or is the client also doing local rendering of geometry sent to it from the servers?

Regards,
Paul

That is correct with two clarifications:

The ?with ?use-offscreen-rendering? explanation is only correct for when ParaView is compiled with OSMesa.

The ?without ?use-offscreen-rendering? behavior only happens because the servers try to open X windows and fail.

Dear all,

so based on the timer log results that i collected, what i read about offscreen-rendering and the explanation below, can i conclude the followings? someone pls correct me if i'm wrong!

with --use-offscreen-rendering

 *   X windows are disabled on all server processes
 *   all server processes render the geometry locally
 *   then each server processes sends the image to the client for compositing
 *   there's NO data gathering to process 0, meaning the master doesn't collect all images from each processes for composting, then only send it to the client for rendering
 *   that's why --use-offscreen-rendering is faster


without --use-offscreen-rendering

 *   X windows are enabled on all server processes
 *   all server processes the raw data, then send all geometry to process 0
 *   process 0 gather all geometry then send them to the client to render
 *   the client does all the rendering job
 *   that's why without --use-offscreen-rendering is slower


any help / reply is highly appreciated

hi chew ping?
  The Problem:"Display is not accessible on the server side. Remote rendering will be disabled.", it means that not all server start up X Server, so the server will process the raw data and send all geometry to the client to render.
  The client do all the rendering job, that's the reason why case 2 is so slow, I think.
  When you use off screen, all server processes render the geometry locally , send image to client to composite, so case 1 much faster than case 2.
  I hope this can help you, for I got the same problem before. Good luck.

Dear all,

--------------------------------------------------------------------


Unlike Case 2, Case 1 does not show any 'Dataserver gathering to 0' or 'Dataserver sending to client'
so i guess what makes Case 2 slower is because the vtkMPIMoveData is doing extra thing to move data amongst processes

btw, whenever i run it without -offscreen-rendering, i get this message:
"Display is not accessible on the server side. Remote rendering will be disabled."

based on what i read from paraview tutorial, what i understand is that the parallel rendering algorithm allows each process to independently render its partition of the geometry and then composites the partial images together to form the final image. Is this what happened in Case 2 because it has 'Datas erver gathering to 0' or 'Dataserver sending to client'?

actually what i dont understand is why case 2 is much slower than case 1?
is it because different 'things' are going on in the processes when offscreen-rendering is on/off?


any help / reply is highly appreciated

chewping

Hey Nima,

Be sure to keep your replies on the list so people who know more about  
this than I do can help out, too. :)

Are you sure that the accuracy is not good enough, or do the contours  
just not look smooth enough? There are, of course, other types of  
spatial interpolation you could do, so maybe you just prefer a more  
sophisticated algorithm, but this is a linear interpolation based on  
the locations of your original data points...

In ParaView you can create a regular grid with a Python Programmable  
Source (here I'll show an example, but there are a few ways of doing  
this...):

Output Data Set Type: vtkImageData

Script:
ido = self.GetImageDataOutput()
exts = ido.GetUpdateExtent()
ido.SetExtent(exts)
org = -10
sp = 0.5
ido.SetOrigin(org, org, org)
ido.SetSpacing(sp, sp, sp)

Script (RequestInformation):
pdo = self.GetImageDataOutput()
N = 41
pdo.SetWholeExtent(0,N-1,0,N-1,0,N-1)

Then, if you have data like the output of the Delaunay3D, you can  
apply the Resample With Dataset filter using the Delaunay output as  
the "Input", and the Programmable Source ImageData as the "Source".  
This relies, though, on having something like the Delaunay results to  
define how the spatial interpolation will be done. (Here, by having  
your data at the vertices of tetrahedral cells, between which the  
scalars will be linearly interpolated.)

VTK also has some other methods for getting from unstructured grids  
(or point sets) to ImageData by "splatting" -- vtkShepardMethod,  
vtkGaussianSplatter & vtkFastSplatter -- which can be incorporated  
into ParaView as plugins fairly easily.

Otherwise, maybe someone else can help figure out how to get your  
usual method of spatial interpolation into ParaView (or, something  
like it could be in there, but I'm just not aware of it because I  
don't usually do that sort of transformation...)

Good luck
-Eric

Hmm. Strange. Looking at the files you sent, I see that this has
something to do with localization. Part of out.vtk looks like:

pression 1 8 double
5 5,1 5,2 5,3 5,4 5,5 5,6 5,7

Somehow, when you write it from Python, the writer is using comma
rather than period for the decimal. Can you check what the file looks
like when you write it using the GUI?

You can get around this by writing your files as binary for now. I
would also submit a bug report at vtk.org/Bug.

I a trying to compute the velocity magnitude but there are some thing I did not well understand:
First, what do the 3 arguments of VectorVariable mean?

  filter.VectorVariable = ['velocity','velocity', '3']

Second, what is wrong here:

  filter.Function = 'mag(velocity)'

Sorry. You were right. Very interesting, our testing did not catch it
because it turned off the feature that broke on purpose. We will fix
it ASAP. Thanks for the report.

Actually I did not realize this but I already faced this issue in the past, with the interactive PV.
This is due to the localization for sure. I am on a "french" lol Mac and I suppose there is some environment variable somewhere that tells qmake to compile a french version of the software. It would be interested to fix this bug though.
Thanks for your help.

Load this dataset with PV, then clic on the slice tool and look at the "show plane" option : instead of a plane, a selection cube appears, which is indeed not located at the center of the object.
Applying the cutting operation leads to the expected result though, but the "show plane" option is of no help for the user in this specific case.
Is this a bug?

The way to specify a vector variable is not entirely intuitive:

filter.VectorVariable = ['velocity', 'velocity', '0', '1', '2']

Hope that helps,

Peter.

Yes it helps, thx.
But what does the 2 first fields mean?
For instance I would like to select the name of the vector field from an argument of the python script, should I do this:
  filter.VectorVariable = [options.name, 'velocity', '0', '1', '2']
or this:
  filter.VectorVariable = ['velocity', options.name, '0', '1', '2']

The way to specify a vector variable is not entirely intuitive:

filter.VectorVariable = ['velocity', 'velocity', '0', '1', '2']

Hope that helps,

Peter.

I a trying to compute the velocity magnitude but there are some thing I did not well understand:
First, what do the 3 arguments of VectorVariable mean?

  filter.VectorVariable = ['velocity','velocity', '3']


Second, what is wrong here:

  filter.Function = 'mag(velocity)'

Just on the occasion of transient 3DCoRectMesh datasets being loaded as 
"Image (Uniform Rectilinear - I just noticed that "Extract Subset" goes 
completely crazy - the output is wrongly sized and contains no cells... 
Accidental or related?

With the Python API, is it possile, in a single instance of Calculator, to compute several new scalar or vector fields, which would involve having several different functions associated to the newly created fields?

I checked the latest CVS (compilation errors see the other thread) and 
the problem is gone, ExtractSubset behaves now correctly.

Thanks

Subject: [Paraview] problems with Xdmf Polyline
Message-ID: <SNT123-W481CEF155447F8AE66909BBC950@phx.gbl>


Hi!

Basically I want to visualize a 1D-array in ParaView, specifying it with the Xdmf-Format. 
My approach is to determine an X-Axis, specifying the x-Coordinates as 1.0, 2.0,.., then specifying the y-Coordinates as my 1D-array I want to visualize und using "Polyline" to "draw" a "plot". 
My sample file doing this looks like the following:

<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<!DOCTYPE Xdmf SYSTEM "Xdmf.dtd" []>
<Xdmf xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" Version="2.0">
  <Domain>
    <Grid Name="Polyline" GridType="Uniform">
      <Topology TopologyType="Polyline"
          >
        <DataItem Format="XML"
            Dimensions="1 8"
            NumberType="Float">
          0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
        </DataItem>
      </Topology>
      <Geometry Type="XYZ">
        <DataItem Format="XML" Dimensions="4 2 3">
          0.0    0.0    0.0
          1.0    2.0    0.0
          2.0    3.0    0.0
          3.0    4.0    0.0

          4.0    3.0    0.0
          5.0    2.0    0.0
          6.0    3.0    0.0
          7.0    4.0    0.0

        </DataItem>
      </Geometry>
    </Grid>
  </Domain>
</Xdmf>


and it works well. 
so, doing this with my data, I get the following Xdmf-File:

<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<!DOCTYPE Xdmf SYSTEM "Xdmf.dtd" []>
<Xdmf xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" Version="2.0">
<Domain>
<!-- Time:     0.29 -->


 <Grid Name="flko" GridType="Uniform">

 <Topology TopologyType="Polyline">
     <DataItem Format="XML" Dimensions="1 10" NumberType="Float">
         0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
 </DataItem>
 </Topology>

<!--Topology TopologyType="3DRectMesh" Dimensions="    1  121  140">
</Topology -->


 <Geometry Type="VXVYVZ">
<DataStructure DataType="Float" Precision="4" Dimensions="170" Format="HDF">
 s2d-more-sun-OT14.00000.h5:/flko/xCoordinates
 </DataStructure>
<DataStructure DataType="Float" Precision="4" Dimensions="170" Format="HDF">
 s2d-more-sun-OT14.00000.h5:/flko/yCoordinates
 </DataStructure>
<DataStructure DataType="Float" Precision="4" Dimensions="170" Format="HDF">
 s2d-more-sun-OT14.00000.h5:/flko/zCoordinates
 </DataStructure>

 </Geometry>


</Grid>
</Domain>
</Xdmf>


In this case, just for testing purposes, I just connected the points 0 - 9. If that worked, I would have tried connecting them all. 

Well, I suspected that I got something wrong in the Geometry part, but trying it with another topology type (the commented one you see here), the grid is visualized well. trying it with the Polyline-Topology, I get a segmentation fault. 

 
Thanks for any piece of advice,
Natalie Happenhofer

No, you need to use the python programmable filter (in conjunction
with numpy) to do that. Here is an example script applied after a
sphere source:

inp = inputs[0]
ns = inp.PointData['Normals']
output.PointData.append(ns*3, "array1")
output.PointData.append(ns/2, "array2")

Here ns is a numpy array (sort of). So, everything numpy supports
should be available to manipulate ns. Also, if you have the source
code, look at /Utilities/VTKPythonWrapping/paraview/vtk/algorithms.py
for some of the algorithms already available.

I did not do any performance comparisons yet but this should actually
be quite faster than the calculator.

I will document this fully for 3.8. Feel free to ask any questions meanwhile.

That property is called MaximumStreamlineLength to be consistent with
the GUI. It sounds like our online documentation is out of date. I
suggest doing:

s = StreamTracer()

Message-ID: <4B1662C3.3080608@itis.ethz.ch>

However: changing ExtractSubset parameters (output extents) at some 
point (after a few changes) "propagates" upstream, i.e., the original 
dataset "inherits" the extents of the downstream filter (gets 
truncated). This is clearly wrong, but probably unrelated to this topic.

BTW. For a longer while I have been observing dramatic drop in PV 
usability. Average time before crashes is only a few minutes. I am 
basically scared to touch anything once I set up my pipeline (change 
names of calculator variables, extents of VOI etc. etc.). My last resort 
of using save states is now failing too, it is usually impossible to 
reload the state (segmentation faults).

Dear All,

I have been having trouble with an issue using ParaView, where-by I'd like
to create streamlines constrained to the surface of a wing i.e. mimick
oil-flow. Has anyone been able to get this to work? I am currently able to
obtain this type of visualisation via the LIC algorithm supplied by VTKEdge.

Any ideas?

Cheers,

Hmm. This is not good. I am guessing this is in CVS ParaView? Do you
know when this started happening? Any suggestions on how to reproduce
it? Also, can you run in a debugger and give us stack traces?

Do you have non-zero vectors on the surface?

In Tcl [reader GetOutput] returns the data set from a reader. Is there the same kind of method in Python? I have just found method for getting cell data, point data and field data.

Yes this is today's CVS, compiled in RELEASE, so no backtrace available.
It does not crash, just invalidates the information upstream.

I do not know when this started happening because it is only today that 
the ExtractSubset at all started working for me.

To reproduce:

1) load 3D transient XMF Uniform 3DCoRectMesh dataset
2) chose ExtractSubset, select a shrinked VOI.
3) (what I do now is volume rendering of the fragment)
4) manipulate the VOI in the ExtractSubset filter a few times.
5) after a few changes the upstream information is damaged (i.e. the 
current VOI has overwriten the original extents and not whole dataset is 
available to subsetting anylonger).

To deliver an example dataset will not be easy (mine is big, 
confidential etc.) but if you cannot reproduce this problem using some 
other test datasets I will try fabricate one for you.

if reader is a vtk class, then use:
reader.GetOutput()

if reader is a paraview proxy AND you are connected to the builtin server,
reader.GetClientSideObject() will return the vtk class, which you can
then cal GetOutput() on.

if reader is a paraview proxy but you are connected to a remote server
then you have to use servermanager.Fetch to aggregate and deliver the
output to the client

Subject: [Paraview] Name of StreamTracer (CustomSource) in Python?

StreamTracerWithCustomSource

Two suggestions:

1. In Python, dir(paraview.simple) or help(paraview.simple)
2. Use idle (or something like it) and StreamTr <tab> for tab completion

These are the methods I use to find a source/filter/writer I can't
remember the name of. Also, use the name in the GUI as a starting
point. The Python name is the GUI name with things like spaces and
parentheses removed.

Best,

Not directly. Even if you extracted a single block, it's still a
vtkMultiBlockDataSet and vtkMultiBlockDataSet cannot be written out as
legacy VTK. What is the data type of the block? You can always use
vtkMergeBlocks to create a vtkUnstructuredGrid and then save out as
legacy vtk files.

Paul,

I've been changing the way plugins are configured. Can you try
clean-building your plugin? If that doesn't work, can you post your
CMakeLists.txt file?

Thanks

I would like to resample an unstructured grid with a regular grid.
My idea was to create a regular grid and then to resample the data with this soucre but I do not find any grid source.
Any help?

You can use something like "Wavelet" to generate your regular grid.

Thx, it works except that it did not resample the point data, so all my point data are assigned 0 values!

The problem is I was looking for such a tool in PV, not in VTK, although I can end by using it of course.

There's a typo in the xml configuration consequently, the Source input
was erroneously named "SeedType" with incorrect documentation. I have
committed a fix to change that back to "Source".

Sorry, bad documentation. SeedType is the property you are looking for.

The longer way of doing this is to save it as a vtm file, then opening
file(s) referring to individual blocks one by one and saving them as
vtk. Why do you want to save the file as legacy vtk?

1. why not use VTK_Edge? What is the drawback?
2. we do:
a. create vector from shear stress components (calculator)
b. Extract the part of multiblock-dataset we want to but streamlines on
c. mask points, random, draw
d. StreamTracerWithCustomSource, Fluid as an Input and mask points as an
source, selecting the created shear stress vector field.

This works quite good but sometimes streamlines break at the border of a
block. However I was considering VTKEdge recently. Is it bad?

I am having a similar problem:

gmake[2]: *** No rule to make target
`/media/portable/VTK_Additions/PointSetNormalEstimation.xml', needed
by `plugin/vtkSMXML_PointSetNormalEstimation.h'.

My CMakeLists.txt in the plugin directory is simply:

INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES(${INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES} ../../)

ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN(PointSetNormalEstimation "1.0"
  SERVER_MANAGER_XML ../../PointSetNormalEstimation.xml
SERVER_MANAGER_SOURCES ../../vtkPointSetNormalEstimation.cxx
)

Thanks,

David

Subject: [Paraview] mvapich2_munmap
Message-ID: <4B17053E.9050305@gmail.com>

I have this strange situation when running paraview on a particular 
build/install/revision of mvapich. Shortly after paraview starts up it 
hangs (I create a cone source, click accept), and watching in top I see 
memory grow before it's killed for using too much. Attaching a debugger 
I see what looks like an infinite recursion. It's only happened to me 
using this particular build of mvapich which happens to be the only one 
on this system.

Just curious if anyone has seen anything like this before?

Just for some test purpose but anyway, the solution given by Utkarsh is convenient for my problem.
Thx

Thx, it works except that it did not resample the point data, so all my point data are assigned 0 values!

1. We do use VTKEdge and it is very fast. However, if you are using a
machine with an older, incompatible or no gpu, or you need a less dense
spread of streamlines (you can't control this in VTKEdge), then you need
another option.

2. I'll give this a go. I've definitely tried this in the past with no
success, but I've never used the mask points option. I'll let you know how
it goes.

Thanks,

Adriano

1. why not use VTK_Edge? What is the drawback?
2. we do:
a. create vector from shear stress components (calculator) b. Extract the
part of multiblock-dataset we want to but streamlines on c. mask points,
random, draw d. StreamTracerWithCustomSource, Fluid as an Input and mask
points as an source, selecting the created shear stress vector field.

This works quite good but sometimes streamlines break at the border of a
block. However I was considering VTKEdge recently. Is it bad?

Utkarsh,

I have similar problem: the generated vtkSMXML_ header files cannot be
found. Attached is my CMakeLists defining the plugins. Some variables are
declared in other places. If you need them, tell me.

Dear Paraviewexperts,

as I'm new to paraview as well as the .vtk-format,
I need to know how my inputfile for a Delaunay2D plot
has to be set up.
As data I only have a list of points in 2D with
vectors applied to them.
That means I have four values for each point:
Two of them describing the offset (x,y) and the other two
describing the direction (dx,dy) of the vector.

So far I've got the following, but something seems to be wrong:

# vtk DataFile Version 3.0
vtk output
ASCII
DATASET UNSTRUCTURED_GRID
POINTS 5433 double
x1 y1
x2 y2
.. ..
.. ..
CELLS 1 4
3 0 1 2
CELL_TYPES 1
5
POINT_DATA 5433
VECTORS Name double
LOOKUP_TABLE default
dx1 dy1
dx2 dy2
.. ..
.. ..


Can you help me change this, so that it works ?
Thank you in advance, I appreciate any help.

Best regards,
Christian Hettkamp

VTK/ParaView does not accept 2D points or vectors. Try adding a third
component with 0 value.

I just put this line in the script area:

and I get this error:

Any idea of the problem?

Further investigations:
- I commented out the ICS/IDS reader plugin that was causing build errors.
Now, it builds.
- The output libraries are now static! Do we have to precise if a plugin is
static or dynamic?

This is visible for several definitely different PV plugin projects.

"make -j 2" gives the following (ending) output:

Subject: [Paraview] Problems loading plugins in pvpython
Message-ID: <004e01ca742b$0427e6a0$4f2810ac@win.ara>

I'm trying to use the LoadPlugin simple module in pvpython, but I keep
getting this error:

>>> LoadPlugin("myLib.so", True)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in ?
  File
"/usr/people/gagliard/Paraview/ParaView3.6.2-rc1/Utilities/VTKPythonWrapping
/paraview/simple.py", line 548, in LoadPlugin

  File

/paraview/servermanager.py", line 2084, in LoadXML
    if not parser.Parse(xmlstring):
TypeError: function takes exactly 2 arguments (1 given)

The help for LoadPlugin states:

Help on function LoadPlugin in module paraview.simple:

LoadPlugin(filename, remote=True, ns=None)
    Loads a ParaView plugin and updates this module with new constructors
    if any. The remote argument (default to True) is to specify whether
    the plugin will be loaded on client (remote=False) or on server
(remote=True).
    If you loaded the simple module with from paraview.simple import *,
    make sure to pass globals() as an argument:
    LoadPlugin("myplugin", False, globals()), to load on client;
    LoadPlugin("myplugin", True, globals()), to load on server;
    LoadPlugin("myplugin", ns=globals()), to load on server.
    Otherwise, the new functions will not appear in the global namespace.

So, I really should be able to pass it a single argument if I want to, but
whether I give it 1, 2 or 3 arguments it will still give me the same
TypeError. However, it works fine in the interactive Python shell. 

Is this a bug or have I forgotten to do something?

Cheers,

Adriano

I've seen this happen when:
* i was working under windows
* i was using an external python shell (idle)

The exact same script ran find under pvpython AND the python shell
within the client. The same script (with path changed appropriately)
on my mac build works fine.

Ok, this is an obvious error on my part. The problem was because I was
trying to load a GUI plugin after loading the servermanager plugin, which is
pointless in batch mode. I guess it is getting too close to Christmas!

Is this a bug or have I forgotten to do something?

Cheers,

Adriano

Jerome,

I've committed a fix for the static library issue. I am tracking down
the build issues everyone's facing.

David,

I am not sure if your problem is related to Paul's. It looks like make
is complaining about missing xml file. Are you sure you are pointing
to the correct xml?

Subject: [Paraview] holes in distributed polydata
Message-ID: <4B17DF5B.60706@gmail.com>

I'm seeing lines where the background shows through a surface polydata 
of quads. When I zoom into the region to investigate the holes are gone. 
Moving the image around the holes appear in different places. They 
depend on camera position. In this surface there are 2.5E6 quads. the 
area is 10x16 units and the number of quads is 1250x2000. each quad has 
0.008 units on a side. I hadn't seen the holes before going to this 
higher resolution. It's likely that the hole is near a process boundary, 
in my polydata filter each process adds his quads to his output 
polydata, in this run the quads are distributed in strips of 512 as needed.

3 holes/lines in bottom half of the image (black background shows through):
http://nashi-submaster.ucsd.edu/movies/PV/bug.png

zoom in no holes/lines:
http://nashi-submaster.ucsd.edu/movies/PV/bug-zoom-2.png

process boundaries (from process id filter):
http://nashi-submaster.ucsd.edu/movies/PV/bug-procs.png

Should PV be able to handle a polydata distributed like this?

Jerome,

I tried to mimic your plugin by a small example but could not
reproduce your issue. If you don't mind helping me track this down,
can you try the following:

* First, try clean building -- delete the build directory for the
plugin (not paraview) and try again.
* Does the vtkSMXML_*.h the compiler is complaining about exist?
* What does ICSImageReader_Plugin.cxx look like?

Thanks,

Utkarsh

Hi,
Thanks for all! Unfortunately, I am currently re-compiling ParaView from
scratch... I will give you a feed-back as soon as my tiny comp' has
finished.

What I can say is that your fix about 'static' link is ok. I did not have to
wait the compilation to end, maybe because this is CMake-script related?

The build error is now reported on a DICOM reader and I am having the
following message :

/home/dje/Softwares/VesselExtraction/Plugins/ParaView/CoronaryExtractionToolbar_Plugin.cxx:43:93:

(Sorry for the frenchy message!!)
The vtkSMXML_DICOMImageReader.h cannot be found. But he exists ! Attached
are vtkSMXML_DICOM.....h and the DICOM_plugin cxx and h.

Thanks again,

Jerome

Subject: [Paraview] Plugin xml checker?
Message-ID: <c19fcadc0912030838h1ac64618n80b4f23539690fb6@mail.gmail.com>

Is there any tool available to "check" an xml file before loading it?
Often when I apply a plugin filter, Paraview simply crashes. It is
always due to an error in my xml file, but I have to go searching for
it manually. Could something be developed to do things like ensure
when you have command="SetUseAutoRadius" that SetUseAutoRadius()
actually exists in the filter? Currently when a plugin fails there is
a lot of guess work and manual hunting that would be nice to replace
by some kind of automatic parser/checker/tester.

Does anyone understand what I mean / agree?

Thanks,

David

Message-ID: <c19fcadc0912030848v1b9adc41vcf52367266f1d59c@mail.gmail.com>

If I have a property such as:

         <DoubleVectorProperty
                            name="Neighbor Radius"
                              command="SetRadius"
                              number_of_elements="1"
                              default_values="1.0">
         </DoubleVectorProperty>

If I load the plugin and immediately set the value and Apply the
filter, the output is correct. However, if I then go back and change
the value and Apply again, the output does not change. Is there
something that needs to be done to enable this functionality?

Thanks,

David

Understand and agree. I would also like to see an official "dtd" file  
for the XML files. Lots of XML editors have "validation" commands that  
will make sure the XML conforms to the DTD spec which can help remove  
some xml related bugs that pop up (not well formed, missing tags,  
attribtutes).
   Also, for advanced XML tools like the ones included in Eclipse and  
NetBeans, the DTD can enable xml "Code Completion" which helps when  
trying to develop the XML in the first place. This helps the user use  
the correct tags and attributes for a given tag. It also would help  
explore the possible tags, versus diving in to the ParaView source  
code and skimming some of the XML files in there.

THanks for letting my "Hijack" the thread Dave..

First, when you apply, does SetRadius() get called on the VTK object?

If not the property doesn't know that it has been changed for some
strange reason (unlikely).

If so, when SetRadius is called, does it invoke Modified() when its
argument changes?

Subject: [Paraview] Plugin behaviour in pvpython
Message-ID: <00a801ca7447$da54a1c0$4f2810ac@win.ara>


I created a reader filter that takes the filename you point it to, strips
the fileroot out and then loads data from files with different extensions.
It works fine in interactive mode, but under pvpython it appears to not be
doing the fileroot stripping stage. Once you set a filename in a python
script, is the filter barred from changing it internally?

Thanks Paul and Jerome,

All those files helped. The issue was exposed where there were
multiple call to ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN in  a CMakeLists.txt file. The
problem was since ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN was a macro, the state of some
variables was cleared cleanly and hence leaked from one call to
another. Fixed that by converting the ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN to a
function (instead of a macro) so variable scopes work as expected.

I've committed a fix. Let me know if that doesn't help.

Subject: [Paraview] Support for text visualization in Paraview
Message-ID: <adb0f27a0912031311v13c5ec88i984089c69350b900@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

To support correlation between physical test data and simulation data,
I import both test data (strain gauge measurement data) and simulation
data (finite element structural analysis data) into Paraview.
Currently we face the challenge that we need to keep track of
approximately 700 strain gauge locations and corresponding values. I
represent these strain gauges as 1D cells (Vertex) in Paraview. Each
of the vertices is than colored by the strain value. This allows very
nice comparison of test and simulation during a test. Since we
reference these strain gauges with unique string labels it would be
very nice if it would be possible to visualize these labels in
paraview. A possibility would be to have a cell or point label. I have
two questions:
   1. Is this already possible with paraview (and how to do it)
   2. If not can someone estimate how much effort it would take to
implement it (if all possible). I would be happy to share the code if
anyone is interested.

Kind regards,

Marco

Hi Marco,

- select all your data using selection controls toolbar.
- open selection inspector and scroll down to display style.
- you will find "Cell Label" and "Point label" tabs. click on the one
you want to display and then check "Visible".

The problem here is that the labels will show up on all you points or
cells. if you want to display your labels on some specific locations
only,
you will have to add a vtkStringArray to your output, SetValue("") on
the points or cells where you don't want to display anything,
and SetValue("a label") on the points where you want to display your labels.

Good luck,

Nehme

Message-ID: <14f7c4810912040042n6e7887e9xf84b39b5c1681e88@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I'd like to plot the result of the "Integrate Variables" Filter over the
Time. Isn't that possible?

In this case, I'm calculating the massflow m' by slicing a pipe, extracting
a surface, generating surface normals, calculate with the calculator
(Result=(NormalsX*Ux+NormalsY*Uy+NormalsZ*Uz)*density) and adding a
"Integrate Variables" Filter.
Plotting all other values over the time works greatly, but I'm not able to
plot the massflow over the time.

Thanks for your help!

Dominic

Subject: [Paraview] Using Paraview with 3 wall stereo-projection
Message-ID: <4B18CFE8.8090706@fz-juelich.de>

Hi,

I would like to use ParaView with our 3 channel passive stereo
projection screen. (See
http://www.fz-juelich.de/jsc/cv/vislab/vr/hardware#screen for details)
I'm using ParaView 3.6.1, which is installed with mpi support on all
machines of the cluster.
I already tried the following, but without success:

* CLIENT:     ./paraview cave.pvx --render-module=CaveRenderModule

* SERVER:   mpirun  -machinefile
/home/demo/work/ParaView3/bin/machines.txt -env DISPLAY :0.0 -n 3
/home/demo/work/ParaView3/bin/pvserver
/home/demo/work/ParaView3/bin/cave.pvx --render-module=CaveRenderModule

with cave.pvx:
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<pvx>
  <Process Type="client" />
  <Process Type="server">
   <Machine Name="zam065-01"
            Environment="DISPLAY=zam065-01:0"
            LowerLeft="-5.2  0   3"
            LowerRight="-1.2 0   3"
            UpperLeft="-5.2  1.5 3" />
   <Machine Name="zam065-02"
            Environment="DISPLAY=zam065-02:0"
            LowerLeft="-2.0 0   3"
            LowerRight="2.0 0   3"
            UpperLeft="-2   1.5 3" />
   <Machine Name="zam065-03"
            Environment="DISPLAY=zam065-03:0"
            LowerLeft="1.2  0   3"
            LowerRight="5.2 0   3"
            UpperLeft="1.2  1.5 3" />
  </Process>
</pvx>

What am I doing wrong?

Hmmm. Are you running from an install ParaView? Which version and
which platform? numpy_support is a Python module that is in VTK. It
should be copied to an install but maybe there is a bug somewhere.

This allows to set/get VTK arrays as numpy arrays (google numpy) for 
much faster processing.

Hello,

I have some questions about the servermanager-module. I'd like to run a test-case on a cluster and visualize the results via  Paraview GUI on client-side. Therefor I have included some classes in the test-case, in order that those results are transformed in vtk-objects and paraview-objects. Getting the results on client-side should work without File I/O. 
Have anyone an idea how I can get the server-side vtk-objects without writing files? Are there some existing examples? Do I have to start my test-case in the python shell of the GUI? If so, how can I manage this?

best regards,
nathalie

Yep, I wasn't calling Modified(), thanks.

Here's another question - this filter generates a data array called
"Curvature". After I apply the filter, I immediately go to the display
tab and change "Color By" to "Curvature". Is there a way to do this
automatically in the xml or somewhere else?

Thanks,

David

I am running from the cvs 3.7.0 source, which I compiled on Mac OS X Leopard, nothing else.
So does it mean that using the programmable filter requires to install an additionnal module?

It is not clear to me what exactly you are trying to do, but I think
you want servermanager.Fetch().

Call Fetch to aggregate and deliver the data produced on the server
back back to the client. See the wiki page, the book or help within
paraview's python shell to learn how to use it.

ParaView 3.6 doesn't support Cave. We lost this functionality while
transitioning from 2.6 to 3.0. We are planning to bring the support

I am not sure why it wouldn't work. Remember to plot point-based
arrays, you should created a point-selection, while to plot cell-based
arrays, you should create a cell-selection.

Who's doing the stripping? Is it the vtkFooReader? In that case,
there's nothing in pvpython that will prevent the vtkFooReader class
from changing the filename internally.

Sure! But you are asking more that simple xml-validity checks. You
also want to ensure that SetUseAutoRadius actually exists on the
vtk-class and is call-able etc. That's far more complicated than it
sounds. However to a great deal, ParaView does give verbose
abort-messages in such cases to help user identify missing commands
etc. To qualify your comment, ParaView doesn't simply crash when such
a filter is created, it aborts with error messages (ofcourse on
windows that may seem no different that crashing -- but on linux when
running from a terminal, I see nice error messages before it aborts).

build are considerably smaller, 30-50% depending on the architecture. In
particular, they do not contain a paraview binary any more, but in the bin
subdirectory merely:

bin/lproj
bin/pvbatch
bin/pvdataserver
bin/pvpython
bin/pvrenderserver
bin/pvserver
bin/smTestDriver

Happens with cmake 2.6.4 and 2.8.0 on 6 different Unix platforms.

ParaView itself builds just fine on these platforms (by now), it's just that the
packaging mechanism seems to be broken. Given that Utkarsh's pre- and
post-branding commit mails on the developer mailing list nor the pdf attachment
listing the internal document
http://www.paraview.org/ParaView3/index.php/ParaView-based_Applications mentions
changes in the cpack mechanism, can anyone confirm my observation?

Sven,

If I remember correctly, in my emails I did mention that the
installation rules are broken and they will be fixed soon (~ 1 month).
We are planning on a general cleanup and restructuring of the install
rules to make sure it packages are generated correctly on all
platforms.

Hello,

I have already tried the command servermanager.Fetch(). And I think it make the right thing on server-side, when I run the test-case with the standard python shell.
But I get no representation in GUI. I have tried to work with the Proxymanager, but I have also read, that this just only works  with the Paraview-Python-Shell. Is this right? When I try to run my test-case in this shell, the function  GetClientSideObject() won't work. It's little bit confusing. Maybe I don't understand the basics of servermanager correctly.

Executing my test-case is done by console. When I start Paraview in server-client-mode, how does Paraview recognize the running test-case? Does a command exist, so that a master process can call or initialize Paraview GUI. Or can I use the methods of Proxymanager from the standard python shell? 

If you like to see the scripts, I would send them to you on Monday or Tuesday. 


best regards,
nathalie

Mike -
Hijacking is only bad when you don't improve the question as you did :)

Utkarsh -
Ah, I am running linux but I never start Paraview from a terminal - I
guess I'll be seeing a lot more useful things than I have been! But to
Mike's suggestions, there could at least be a syntax checker (DTD I
guess it's called in XML?), as well as checking for class existence.
It could at least make the assumption that in:

<SourceProxy name="NormalEstimation"
class="vtkPointSetNormalEstimation" label="NormalEstimation">

The files vtkPointSetNormalEstimation.h/cxx need to exist. I think any
little scripts/checks like this that could be done to help nail down
problems would be great (I guess especially for windows developers).
Should we make a feature request with some of these things so some
brave person can start looking into it?

Thanks,

David

Ouch. That's very distributed :-) Does the problem go away when you
decrease the number of partitions?

Just for the record:

When you do so, please remember that Qt-cocoa needs the qt_menu.nib  
directory in the Resources. Also, I think I had trouble with  
QT_QTCLUCENE_LIBRARY not being included in the bundle and a missing  
empty qt.conf file (to prevent Qt from loading png/tiff plugins).

Subject: [Paraview] paraview 3.6.1 change isosurface value based on data in
 vtk file series
Message-ID: <20091204234736.EIL24770@ms4.nss.udel.edu>

Hello,
I wanted to know how the following can be done

I have a time series data as a set of .vtk files. file0.vtk, 
file1.vtk.....file100.vtk
I want to see isosurface for each time step, but i want the 
isosurface value to be based on the data at that time step

for eg: time step 3 - file3.vtk should have the isosurface as 
mean value of the data in file3.vtk

How do I perform the above? 
Note that I cannot animate the contour isosurface value - 
since it must be based on specific time step data.

thanks and regards
Gowri

its ugly but I get a lot better performance by splitting the work up 
dynamically with a small grain size. in the run shown below there are 
only 16 processes but there are a whole lot of process boundaries.

I was able to reproduce it on a second system today.

these holes are pretty non-deterministic in where they show up. moving 
the camera they can show up in different places. Which makes sense if 
this is related to some parallel rendering/finite precision issue with 
all those process boundaries. The small size of the quads are also a 
factor, because I didn't ever notice it before when using larger quads.

I saved the data as a legacy file and opening it on my desktop there are 
no issues, so its definitely a parallel only issue. Also running through 
D3 seems to fix it, but the issue may still be there because with the 
minimal number of process boundaries its much less likely to get the 
camera in just the right position.

I notice there are lookmarks in PV 3.6.1 but not in the recent CVS.
Have they been dropped?

Anyone else having a problem with the spread sheet view? When I click
the "split vertically" button and then click "Spreadsheet view", I
used to be able to see selection details (the spreadsheet), etc but
now the window is just gray.

This issue has been fixed in CVS late last week. Is your ParaView
up-to-date?

It's reproducible. I'll take a look, shouldn't be too hard to fix.

I'm using the split function to get the file's name and extension. I think I
may have a workaround for this in the short term.

Who's doing the stripping? Is it the vtkFooReader? In that case, there's
nothing in pvpython that will prevent the vtkFooReader class from changing
the filename internally.

Hi Ken, did you received my last e-mail (on 1st december)? I write you
again...


It seems that we have finally resolved the problem regarding OSMesa.

Now can you help us to configure paraview options to improve the
performances on our cluster (8 nodes dual quad core -> 8 core per node = 64
cores; no GPU; 10 GB ram per node)?

If we run pvserver vith 64 processes (8 processes per node with: mpirun -np
64 -machinefile list pvserver --use-offscreen-rendering)
we have problems to load and/or execute operations with big models (20*10^6
cells) exported from CFD++ in Ensight binary mode (it seems that Paraview
loop endless).

Our client configuration is (version 3.6.1):

edit -> settings -> render view:
- use immediate mode rendering: checked
- use triangle strips: unchecked
- LOD threshold: unchecked
- outline threshold: 500 MCells
- allow rendering interrups: unchecked
- enable deept pelling: checked
- number of peels: 4
- use offscreen rendering for screenshot: checked

edit -> settings -> server:
- remote rendering threshold: checked, 0 MBytes
- suppress ordered compositing: checked
- subsample rate: checked, 4 pixels
- squirt compression: checked, 10Bits
- still subsample rate: checked, 4 pixels
- client collect: checked, 97 MBytes
- compositing threshold: unchecked


Can you help us?
Thanks again
Luis

Dear all.

Last year I had installed on a Cray machine Paraview 3.4.0 and both

as documented here

Burlen,

For the zoom in, you say there are no holes/lines, but in the image I see a grid of lines.  It looks like you have a bunch of little quads with spacing in between them.  Is this the case?  If so, then the "hole" artifacts you see on the bottom of the screen are probably simply aliasing artifacts.  They are places where the pixel happens to align right where the gap is.

I can't think of an easy way around this (other than to modify your data to remove the gaps, if that makes sense).  Anti-aliasing techniques such as oversampling or smoothing would probably fix the problem, but they would also break the parallel rendering so they are no good.

I was able to reproduce it on a second system today.

these holes are pretty non-deterministic in where they show up. moving
the camera they can show up in different places. Which makes sense if
this is related to some parallel rendering/finite precision issue with
all those process boundaries. The small size of the quads are also a
factor, because I didn't ever notice it before when using larger quads.

I saved the data as a legacy file and opening it on my desktop there are
no issues, so its definitely a parallel only issue. Also running through
D3 seems to fix it, but the issue may still be there because with the
minimal number of process boundaries its much less likely to get the
camera in just the right position.

Hey Dominik,

I asked some Kitware folks about this at the IEEE Vis conference, and  
they said that Lookmarks are being dropped in favor of the recently  
implemented Python trace & macros functionality. For a more detailed  
explanation you'll have to wait for more official sources. :)

Talk to you later,

You must be very brave to attempt to try to drive a tiled display with a Windows cluster.  In my experience it is quite difficult to work with MPI jobs on Windows clusters.  (I hear that the MS HPC platform should be better, but there may be other issues with driving graphics cards on them.)

At any rate, this may simply be an issue with your pvserver MPI job not having access to the Windows console.  I don't think the Windows OS is generally all that keen on giving a remotely launched application access to the console graphics, so the MPI implementation needs to work around that somehow.  I don't know if, for example, MPICH can do that.

There were some changes to python scripting from 3.4 to 3.6 and not all were backward compatible (a necessity to support the paraview.simple module).  You may need to update your script.  Does it run on a typical client?

Hi Ken,
I understand that the old script does not work because of the changes 
but it seems that there is a bigger problem because as mentioned in my 
previous mail the  line

from paraview.simple import * 

fails, while this is supposed to work with the new version, isn't it? 
This line also fails with the pvpython client.
Also, is there a python script written in the new format, I could use 
for testing?
Thanks,
Mina

Luis,

I saw your email, but I have been on travel and don't have a quick answer for your problem, so I have not had a chance to respond.  This is why it is always a good idea to cc the ParaView mailing list.

Offhand I do not know what the problem might be.  The first thing I would check would be to make sure that none of the processes has crashed.  You are loading a lot of data, so if it is not partitioned in a way that allows it to be load balanced well you could be running out of memory.  If you find that all the processes are doing something, then it would be helpful to know exactly where they are spending a lot of time.

-Ken

Hi Ken, did you received my last e-mail (on 1st december)? I write you again...


It seems that we have finally resolved the problem regarding OSMesa.

Now can you help us to configure paraview options to improve the performances on our cluster (8 nodes dual quad core -> 8 core per node = 64 cores; no GPU; 10 GB ram per node)?

If we run pvserver vith 64 processes (8 processes per node with: mpirun -np 64 -machinefile list pvserver --use-offscreen-rendering)
we have problems to load and/or execute operations with big models (20*10^6 cells) exported from CFD++ in Ensight binary mode (it seems that Paraview loop endless).

Our client configuration is (version 3.6.1):

edit -> settings -> render view:
- use immediate mode rendering: checked
- use triangle strips: unchecked
- LOD threshold: unchecked
- outline threshold: 500 MCells
- allow rendering interrups: unchecked
- enable deept pelling: checked
- number of peels: 4
- use offscreen rendering for screenshot: checked

edit -> settings -> server:
- remote rendering threshold: checked, 0 MBytes
- suppress ordered compositing: checked
- subsample rate: checked, 4 pixels
- squirt compression: checked, 10Bits
- still subsample rate: checked, 4 pixels
- client collect: checked, 97 MBytes
- compositing threshold: unchecked


Can you help us?
Thanks again
Luis

If you are using OSMesa, you should not need X running on any of the nodes.  It should be sufficient to have the OSMesa libraries and associated Mesa GL libraries installed on a shared folder.  However, make sure that folder is actually mounted everywhere (a common failure in my experience) and that they are the ones actually loaded for each node.

I'm sorry, I explained the problem very bad; we are using OSMesa library.

If we run pvserver only on the master node:

mpirun -np 2 pvserver --use-offscreen-rendering

It's all ok (even if DISPLAY variable is not set: we don't know if it's necessary).


If we try to use 2 nodes (master and node1), running this command on the master node:

mpirun -x LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/user/ParaView/ParaView-bin/bin/:/usr/lib/:/home/user/ParaView/ComponentiAggiuntivi/lib -np 2 -machinefile /home/user/ParaView/NodesList /home/user/ParaView/ParaView-bin/bin/pvserver --use-offscreen-rendering

X is running on the second node (called node1); DISPLAY is not set neither on node master nor in the second node.
Must X server run on each node and must DISPLAY variable to be set also if we are using OSMesa library?

Must we install OSMesa on each node or it's enough to have installed that library on a shared folder (/home/user/ParaView/Components/lib) in the master node?

Have you any other idea?

Thank you very much for your patience

By "usual error" do you mean the crash in the GL or pthreads library?  It could be that the environment in the non-master nodes is incorrect.

Hi ken, thanks again.

we recompiled again OSMesa library (only on the master node of our cluster; the libraries file are generated on a shared folder - /home/user/ParaView/Components/lib - visible on each node), then we recompiled Paraview with these libraries (and setting shared libraries=off in ccmake menu); now we are able to connect the client with pvserver provided that pvserver runs only on the master node.

If we run pvserver on two or more nodes with the command:

mpirun -x LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/user/ParaView/Components/lib -np 2 -machinefile NodesList pvserver --use-offscreen-rendering

we always get the usual error when we try to connect the client with the server

Must X server run on each node? Currently X server is not running on any node (if we execute "pidof X" we obtain nothing) and DISPLAY variable is not set, but we can connect the client with the master node...

Have you any idea? Can you help us?

(Responding back to the ParaView list.)

These symbols should be defined in the GL library that is part of Mesa.  You should have a library like /home/myuser/TempOSMesa/Mesa-7.6/lib/libGL.so.  That is where the symbols should be defined.  libOSMesa.so simply references those libraries.  It is because the symbols cannot be found in the GL library that you are getting the error.  You can use the 'nm' command to query what symbols are defined are what are required.

It sounds like you are still linking to the system OpenGL libraries somehow.  Those symbols should be defined in the libGL.so that is built with Mesa (whereas the /usr/lib/libGL.so on your system probably does not have them).


Hi Ken,
thanks again.

Looking the errors such as:

"home/myuser/TempOSMesa/Mesa-7.6/lib/libOSMesa.so: undefined reference to `_mesa_free_context_data'"

I believe those symbols must be defined in libOSMesa.so library and not in /usr/lib/libGL.so library.

In fact, if we install OSMessa using Debian packages we can compile ParaView, but we can't connect client and server; the error always is similar to:

ParaView3/Servers/Common/vtkServerConnection.cxx, line 67

If instead we compile OSMesa ourselves we can't compile ParaView: I believe that something went wrong compiling OSMesa (some simbols aren't present in libOSMesa.so created), but I don't know if compiling OSMesa ourselves can help us to resolve our problem.

We also tried to install on our cluster ParaView 3.6.1already compiled (downloaded from http://www.paraview.org/paraview/resources/software.html) and it works: we can establish client-server connection.

But if we try to run more 2 or more pvserver instances on the same node (mpirun -np 2 pvserver), we have this error:

"vtkProcessModuleConnectionManager (0x23d6da0): Failed to set up server socket"


 Did you do a clean build of ParaView (that is, delete the binary directory and start over from scratch)?  If you just tried to change some CMake variables in an existing build, you may have some stale libraries built.

We did "make clean".

You should also check to make sure that the executables being built are linking to your compiled Mesa libraries instead of the system libraries.  You can check this with the ldd command.  You may have to set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to point to /home/myuser/TempOSMesa/Mesa-7.6.

We also tried to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

Can you help us?

Not really, but I would consider trying downloading the Mesa source and compiling it myself.  Since the error is happening somewhere in the OpenGL libraries (and is not really being replicated on other user's platforms), the only cause I can come up with is a problem with the libraries (and mismatched libraries is the most common problem).  Compiling Mesa is actually pretty easy, so it is worth taking the effort to check.

Could it be a problem with mismatched libraries?  I notice in the error below that it occurs in /usr/lib/libGL.so.1.  This is a system library.  Did you compile OSMesa yourself?  If so, then you should not be using the system GL libraries; you should be using the libraries that you compiled when you also generated the OSMesa library.

Hi,
we have a Linux (Debian) cluster without gpu and we have a big problem using Paraview 3.6.1in client - server mode.
The server has been compiled with OSMesa library and following the instructions reported here (in particular the section "OSMesa support"):

http://www.itk.org/Wiki/Setting_up_a_ParaView_Server

If we try to connect the client started with the command:

paraview

and the server, started with the command:

pvserver --use-offscreen-rendering

we must disable the checkbox "Remote rendering threshold" (but this causes bad performances) in the client settings (Edit -> Settings -> Render view -> Server), othervise Paraview crashes after loading a big input or performing some operation such us changing "outline" to "wireframe"...

The error always is (similar to):

ParaView3/Servers/Common/vtkServerConnection.cxx, line 67

This error also occurs if we start client and server logging directly (without any ssh connection) on the master node; on master node X is running and we can execute the test:

mpirun -np 4 /usr/X11R6/bin/glxgears

So, it doen't seem a problem regarding X connection and permission...

Moreover, executing the test:

/ParaView/ParaView-bin$ ctest -I ,,10

we obtain some segmentation fault, but the log file can't give any useful information.

..

On our local machine with gpu 100% test passed, and we haven't any problem to connect client and server on that machine.


MPI version is: mpirun (Open MPI) 1.2.7rc2
OSMesa version is: 7.0.3-7


We searched on google, on Paraview wiki... without any succes: can you help us please?

Mina,

It's possible that there were some #ifndef's missing in
Servers/ServerManager/Resources/rendering.xml in 3.6.1 which meant,
when ParaView was compiled without Qt, it would still try to look for
certain proxies. I am looking at 3.6.2 source and they are now fixed
(You might want to check out the latest release candidate with cvs-tag
	ParaView-3-6-2-rc2). That would explain the importing error in
pvpython on Crays.

Hi Utkarsh,
Thanks for the information, but would you expect this fix to resolve the 
issue with pvbatch as well (as i am more interested in pvbatch to work  
properly rather than pvpython)
Thanks,
Mina

pvbatch and pvpython are not much different, they use the came core so
the fix should apply to both.

If you're just running mpi you need to enable your mpi service to interact
with the desktop. You can do this by going into the Services manager
(Control Panel -> Administrative Tools -> Services) and going into the
properties of your MPI service (MPICH2 Process Manager, if you're using
MPICH2 from Argonne). On the Log On tab there is a check box "Allow service
to interact with desktop". If you're using HPC server and the HPC Job
Manager there is an environment variable that must be set (which I can dig
up if that is the case).

Message-ID: <024601ca775c$7fbba160$4f2810ac@win.ara>


Does anyone know how to disable the pop-up window for opengl rendering? If
it isn't possible via the interactive interface, could someone give me
pointers as to where in the source code this is called? It's something I'd
really like to get rid of without having to use software-based rendering.

Cheers,

On the latest build from CVS I am getting a black 3D view when I set
the opacity to anything other than 1.  This has never happened before
- has something with the rendering changed?

Hi Ken,
For that figure you mention I turned on "surface with edges" to show the 
cell size better. Sorry I can see how that could be confusing. But just 
to clarify, there aren't actually any holes in the surface.

Here is another zoom in of the same area where "surface with edges" is 
off and you can see that there are no holes.
http://nashi-submaster.ucsd.edu/movies/PV/bug-zoom.png

Now I also have hit a case where after running through D3 I got a hole 
at the process boundary. this run had 80 processes, the surface shown 
has dimensions of 5.5 x 10 units with 1500 x 2727quads with side 0.0036 
units.
http://nashi-submaster.ucsd.edu/movies/PV/bug-d3.png

I am only seeing this with the small quads and in parallel at process 
boundaries.

I believe you are talking about the server-side render window that pops up.

I am attaching a experimental patch to get you started. It works only
on Linux. All I am doing it not mapping the window. Now when you run
server with offscreen:

pvserver --use-offscreen-rendering

and connect to it from ParaView client, you should no longer see any
server-side windows when remote rendering.

Of course the patch is more of a hack, but it should give you a starting point.

This is from the auto loading - it will work if I load in the other
plugin first.  It is telling me that it is not a valid qt plugin and
then it also says which library is missing (the other plugin)

BTW I also have problems when loading plugins that contain GUI
components in pvpython.  I was on the verge of merging all my GUI and
SM plugins together when I realised this.  The only solution I have
found is to LD_PRELOAD all the GUI libraries.

Paul

As stated below, lookmarks are being deprecated, and the Python trace tool can be used instead.  

You get to the Python Trace by going to Tools/ Python Shell/ Trace.  We also know that this functionality needs to be moved somewhere that is easier to find.

Hmm.  It is possible that the "floating viewport" feature of IceT could be causing troubles with precision.  Could you try adding

icetDisable(ICET_FLOATING_VIEWPORT);

somewhere in the vtkIceTRenderManager::UpdateIceTContext() method and see if the problem goes away?

Hi Ken,
For that figure you mention I turned on "surface with edges" to show the
cell size better. Sorry I can see how that could be confusing. But just
to clarify, there aren't actually any holes in the surface.

Here is another zoom in of the same area where "surface with edges" is
off and you can see that there are no holes.
http://nashi-submaster.ucsd.edu/movies/PV/bug-zoom.png

Now I also have hit a case where after running through D3 I got a hole
at the process boundary. this run had 80 processes, the surface shown
has dimensions of 5.5 x 10 units with 1500 x 2727quads with side 0.0036
units.
http://nashi-submaster.ucsd.edu/movies/PV/bug-d3.png

I am only seeing this with the small quads and in parallel at process
boundaries.

Is this dependency among plugins because you are referring to some
classes defined my plugin A in plugin B? If so, you might be better
off creating a library for the common classes and then have the two
plugins depend on it. You'll have to use LD_LIBRARY_PATH or rpaths to
ensure that the shared libraries are loaded when the plugins are
loaded. ParaView currently does not guarantee any order when trying to
auto-load the plugins at startup. That  may be something worth
investigating.

Subject: Re: [Paraview] Disabling OpenGL window pop-up

I believe you are talking about the server-side render window that pops up.

I am attaching a experimental patch to get you started. It works only on
Linux. All I am doing it not mapping the window. Now when you run server
with offscreen:

pvserver --use-offscreen-rendering

and connect to it from ParaView client, you should no longer see any
server-side windows when remote rendering.

Of course the patch is more of a hack, but it should give you a starting
point.

Then something is wrong with your PYTHONPATH. If you are running
pvpython or the Python shell from the GUI, this should already work -
please report it as a bug to me. If you are running pure Python, this
directory has to be in your PYTHONPATH (not a bug). I am surprised
that your could import any modules at all. I am guessing that you have
the module directory in the source code in your path. If that's the
case, please replace it with the one in the binary tree.

Hi Ken and others,
If I apply these filters to my data set: Data -> Gradient -> Surface
Flow, the result (shown in on the information tab of the Surface Flow
object) is 0.

With another 3D data set I did not succeed in calculating the flow
either. I imagine that I need to do something like:
Data set -> Gradient -> Extract Surface -> Integrate Flow
How do I extract the correct surface? The extract surface filter
description says that in extracts the total outer surface. In my case
this results in a nett flow of 0.
I have a hollow cylinder and need to calculate the flow over the inner
surface and (a part of) the outer surface. How can I achieve this?

This is fixed by adding my plugin directory to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

I was recently had some .obj files to view and noticed to my surprise
that ParaView doesn't support reading them - I'd guess since they aren't
mentioned in the Servers/ServerManager/Resources/readers.xml

Is there any reason that they aren't enabled? Or just an oversight?

Thank you Dave! It runs with your tip!
But I have two more questions:

When I connect from the client to the server the paraview render windows
are shown fullscreen (only the task bar is visible) on my visualization
cluster nodes. But if I make any change on the client side, e.g.
applying a filter, the render windows on visualization nodes become the
same size as the render window of my client application? Is this a
feature? Of course, I want the display on my visualization nodes always
to go fullscreen.

And can I specify that the render window on the visualization nodes open
up on the second monitor of that node? It is always displayed on the
first monitor.

Thank you really much for your answers!

PS: I am using mpich2 (x32) for Windows

What is the "inner surface"?  Do you mean that there is a hollow part in the middle and you want the surface between the mesh and the empty space in the middle?  If that is the case, then Extract Surface will extract that as well.  You just might not be able to see it if it is completely encased in another mesh.  You would have to clip away (or make transparent) the outer surface to see anything inside.

If that is not what you mean by inner surface, then I have no idea what you mean.  You could construct an infinite number of surfaces from the interior of a mesh.

Hi Ken and others,
If I apply these filters to my data set: Data -> Gradient -> Surface
Flow, the result (shown in on the information tab of the Surface Flow
object) is 0.

With another 3D data set I did not succeed in calculating the flow
either. I imagine that I need to do something like:
Data set -> Gradient -> Extract Surface -> Integrate Flow
How do I extract the correct surface? The extract surface filter
description says that in extracts the total outer surface. In my case
this results in a nett flow of 0.
I have a hollow cylinder and need to calculate the flow over the inner
surface and (a part of) the outer surface. How can I achieve this?

Subject: [Paraview] colour by a different vector component in two views
Message-ID: <c9adba420912080626v5aedc64cr2fc367f2ea377085@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

If you try a view a different component of the same vector in
different views it will update both views to the same component.  E.g.
use cube source, open two views, display first to colour by normals
and X, set second to colour by normals and Y, select the first view
again and it will also display Y.

Regards,
Paul

That's right, this is because the component choice is a property of
the lookup table and the lookup table for an array with a given name
and number of components is same for all views and sources. A solution
is to use the calculator or python programmable filter to create
another clone array with a different name and then color to two
differently.

Hi,

I've found a bug with the calculator:

create a box
apply calculator filter: array name "a", value "1"
apply calculator again: array name "b", value "2"

now change the input for the second calculator to the box and you get
the following error:

vtkArrayCalculator (0x28b3d40): Invalid array name: a

Even though it doesn't use that array...

The problem is more general.

Create a custom filter using calculator and the data (u,v,w,p) 
sqrt(u^2+v^2+w^2). Save a custom filter. Now re-open the data but now do 
not read 'p' array this time (XDMF). Apply custom filter. Calculator 
will complain p is absent.

I am not sure why this is a problem? The custom filter will preserve
your equation. So the next time you use the custom filter, it an array
required in the calculator is missing, it should indeed complain.

Please note that 'p' is not required in the Results formula. Only those 
variables should be required that are needed to form a valid formula, 
not those that were originally present.

Subject: [Paraview] using integrate variables between two filters
Message-ID: <73bd53f00912090341s4a525bf1ga8e07b44e0ab3d73@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I use Paraview to post process results from finite element simulations
and find it very useful. There is however, one thing that seems
feasible but I cannot find out how to do in Paraview and I would
appreciate it if someone could tell me whether it is possible.

I write data from my simulation to file as .vtk with a number of
variables at each mesh location (say x velocity, y velocity and
pressure). In Paraview I can load the file, compute result =
velocity_X - velocity_Y using the calculator and then integrate
variables to get the integral of velocity_X - velocity_Y on the mesh.
This is obviously not a very useful result in general, what I really
want is to compute velocity_X_simulation_1 - velocity_X_simulation_2,
where simulation 1 and 2 share the same mesh but some different
parameters. I can use a similar method to the one described above as
long as the data from both simulations is stored in the same .vtk
file, but is it possible to load two .vtk files into a single
pipeline, or to access data across pipelines for the integrate
variables method?

An even more optimistic question, if the two simulations are run on
meshes that exist on the same domain (i.e. region in space) but have a
different set of nodes, say the mesh for simulation 2 is refined once
more than the mesh from simulation 1, is it possible for Paraview to
interpolate data from the less refined mesh to the more refined mesh
in order to compute velocity_X_simulation_1 - velocity_X_simulation_2
and integrate?

The first scenario seems technically feasible, if it has been offered
in Paraview. Alternatively, are there specialized programs that can
read two .vtk files and combine their variables into a single .vtk
file? The second is more optimistic and couldn't be done without
explicitly interpolating the results from one mesh to the other. I
have found the Group Datasets filter, but this does not seem to quite
do it (the data sets are marked (partial) once grouped and calculating
differences fails).

Thank you for any ideas about how I could achieve this, and also
confirming whether it can be done in Paraview or if I should make
another plan will help me to move forward.

Regards,
Michael

Hi Michael,

Your first question has been discussed before, e.g., here:
http://markmail.org/message/jon3wyz3ve2rzza5

Regarding your second question you're looking for the ParaView filter Resample
with Dataset. It takes two inputs which will be your coarse and refined grid.
See the filter's help for more details.

Sven

Hi,

I checkout the CVS today and since then, my custom filters taking 2 input
ports refuse to be set on the second input.
I can reproduce it with the "Stream tracer (custom source)". Does anyone not
this?

That looks like an error we had been getting due to commit to ParaView
a few days back. Try updating your ParaView.

Utkarsh,

I've now been able to test out the new patch and it is working fine. To be
honest, this is all that is required as it removes the annoyance of having
numerous pop-up windows cluttering your desktop anytime you try to run
ParaView in parallel.

Thanks again!

Subject: Re: [Paraview] Disabling OpenGL window pop-up

I believe you are talking about the server-side render window that pops up.

I am attaching a experimental patch to get you started. It works only on
Linux. All I am doing it not mapping the window. Now when you run server
with offscreen:

pvserver --use-offscreen-rendering

and connect to it from ParaView client, you should no longer see any
server-side windows when remote rendering.

Of course the patch is more of a hack, but it should give you a starting
point.

Sven,
sorry for the typo : I meant "note this?". I also noted the builtin server
named "b" at startup.

After the update the plugin is (seems) loaded (no errors at least) but
the Point Sprite is still not available:

I am not sure what you mean by "refuse to be set on the second input".
I just tried creating "Stream tracer (custom source)" and it seems to
work fine for me.

Hi,

I can reproduce the behaviour J?r?me described with some of my nightly builds.
Load the state attached, select RandomVectors and apply
StreamTracerWithCustomSource filter. As Source try to select the PointSource.
The GUI won't let you select it. Happens with a 32bit Linux build, a 64bit Linux
build. Not with a Solaris SPARC build, though.

Moreover, when I start up paraview in builtin mode, the server in the pipeline
view is merely called "b", only when opening a file it becomes "builtin".

Sven

Message-ID: <811a1f290912091259y45e36af4y50dc0f945ca089af@mail.gmail.com>

I am developing my plugin and while configuring ParaView 3.6.1 with
CMake I am getting the following warning:

kwProcessXML not found.  Plugin may not build correctly

It seems like I should be worried about this? I am building both a
client and Server plugin.

I am including the Plugin into the ParaView build by setting the

Maybe left out something from the CMake ?

Subject: [Paraview] Error when Moc'ing During a Client Side Plugin
	Compilation
Message-ID: <811a1f290912091349o43610dc5l5659de0db2cc290e@mail.gmail.com>

I am getting the following error when VS runs the build for my Client
Side Plugin:

2>------ Build started: Project: MXAReaderClientPlugin, Configuration:
Debug Win32 ------
2>Generating moc_pqMXAReaderPanelImplementation.cxx
2>C:/Users/mjackson/Workspace/ParaView3-3.6.1/i386/Plugins/MXAPlugins/Client/pqMXAReaderPanelImplementation.h(45):
Error: Undefined interface
2>Project : error PRJ0019: A tool returned an error code from
"Generating moc_pqMXAReaderPanelImplementation.cxx"

The line in question is :
Q_INTERFACES(pqObjectPanelInterface)

I have checked to make sure the include paths have both the QObject
and the pqObjectPanelInterface.h file on them. Not really sure what
else to try?

Any help is appreciated.

I make the change listed in the bug report but that didn't seem to
make a difference.

I've tried to use this filter to show the time, but when I apply it it shows 
the file number, not the time. Is there some special setting? Or my vtk file 
doesn.t contain the information?

Forget my bad english.

There is no way for ParaView to read file information from some VTK
file formats (because they don't support time). Which file format are
you using (what is the extension)? Also, what is type of your data
(rectilinear, curvilinear, unstructured etc.)?

Dear Sven,

Thank you for that answer. I would have struggled to find that post
and both do exactly what I need.

Something that I noticed when applying step 4:
> 4) Use Calculator #2 on AppendAttributes1 to take difference (eg h1-h0).
If h1 and h0 are extracted as a single component of a vector, eg
velocity_0, I get an error when applying this calculator:

ERROR: In /home/kitware/ParaView-3.6/ParaView3/VTK/Common/vtkFunctionParser.cxx,
line 1629
vtkFunctionParser (0x3376110): Syntax error: operator expected; see position 2

ERROR: In /home/kitware/ParaView-3.6/ParaView3/VTK/Common/vtkFunctionParser.cxx,
line 1629
vtkFunctionParser (0x3376110): Syntax error: operator expected; see position 2

Warning: In /home/kitware/ParaView-3.6/ParaView3/VTK/Graphics/vtkArrayCalculator.cxx,
line 394
vtkArrayCalculator (0x3036ec0): An error occured when parsing the
calculator's function.  See previous errors.

I have seen these errors on Linux paraview 3.6.1 and 3.2.1 as well as
Mac 3.4. Interestingly enough if I set up the initial two calculators
with a scalar field, e.g. pressure, it works fine and I can later swop
the pressures to velocity_0 with out any problem. (In order to test
this I used a single .vtk file with a vector velocity a scalar
pressure and made a copy of the file copy of the file. Once the inputs
were swopped I confirmed that the difference between the velocities in
the files was zero.)

I was surprised that taking the velocities directly failed, but
specifying the pressures first and swopping seems to be a good work
around.

Thanks for the help!
Michael

Thanks in advance for your time & any clues.

Subject: [Paraview] cvs version of paraview not installing client
Message-ID: <4B2100DD.5070301@arl.army.mil>

I am attempting to build and install the latest cvs version of paraview.

I have tried building it with both the cvs version of cmake and the 
latest 2.8 release of cmake.

It builds everything, but it doesn't install the client. The following 
gets installed in bin:
lproj  plugins  pvbatch  pvdataserver  pvpython  pvrenderserver  
pvserver  smTestDriver

I would expect to see something like this:
assistant  lproj  paraview  plugins  pvbatch  pvdataserver  pvpython  
pvrenderserver  pvserver  pvTestDriver  vtkSMExtractDocumentation

I use the same flags when installing paraview 3.6, and both the client 
and server get installed.

Am I missing a flag or doing something wrong with the install?

Thanks,

Due to changes that we are currently working on, the installation for
ParaView in CVS is broken. We are working on fixing it.

Carrie,

A similar question has been posted a week ago and yesterday. Please see
http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2009-December/014869.html and/or
http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2009-December/014931.html

Summarizing them:
'make install', 'make package', 'cpack -G ...' are currently broken.
ETA for a fix is 1 month.

Sven

Ah, found my problem. I was naming the output from the first
calculators staring with a digit, 01_x for example. This was fine for
displaying etc but does not seem to be valid for the next calculator.
I have fixed this now, please ignore my previous message.

Hi.
Please, tell me where can I find info about using plugins from python?
I use LoadPlugin() for ParaView-3.7 and for 3.6.2 but without result:
plugin is loaded without errors, but not visible:

In [8]: LoadPlugin
('/opt/ParaView-3-6-2-rc1/bin/plugins/CSCS_PointSprite_Plugin/libCSCS_PointSprite_Plugin.so',globals())

In [9]: Sphere()
Out[9]: <paraview.servermanager.Sphere object at 0x1d9ab10>

In [10]: dp=Show()
vtkSphereSource : [ ...........]

In [11]: dp.GetProperty('Representation').Available
Out[11]: ['Outline', 'Points', 'Wireframe', 'Surface', 'Surface With Edges']

I.e. Point Sprite representation is not available. Is this a bug or am I
doing something wrong?

Luis,

I saw your email, but I have been on travel and don't have a quick answer for your problem, so I have not had a chance to respond.  This is why it is always a good idea to cc the ParaView mailing list.

Offhand I do not know what the problem might be.  The first thing I would check would be to make sure that none of the processes has crashed.  You are loading a lot of data, so if it is not partitioned in a way that allows it to be load balanced well you could be running out of memory.  If you find that all the processes are doing something, then it would be helpful to know exactly where they are spending a lot of time.

It seems that we have finally resolved the problem regarding OSMesa.

Now can you help us to configure paraview options to improve the performances on our cluster (8 nodes dual quad core -> 8 core per node = 64 cores; no GPU; 10 GB ram per node)?

If we run pvserver vith 64 processes (8 processes per node with: mpirun -np 64 -machinefile list pvserver --use-offscreen-rendering)
we have problems to load and/or execute operations with big models (20*10^6 cells) exported from CFD++ in Ensight binary mode (it seems that Paraview loop endless).

Our client configuration is (version 3.6.1):

edit -> settings -> render view:
- use immediate mode rendering: checked
- use triangle strips: unchecked
- LOD threshold: unchecked
- outline threshold: 500 MCells
- allow rendering interrups: unchecked
- enable deept pelling: checked
- number of peels: 4
- use offscreen rendering for screenshot: checked

edit -> settings -> server:
- remote rendering threshold: checked, 0 MBytes
- suppress ordered compositing: checked
- subsample rate: checked, 4 pixels
- squirt compression: checked, 10Bits
- still subsample rate: checked, 4 pixels
- client collect: checked, 97 MBytes
- compositing threshold: unchecked


Can you help us?
Thanks again

If you are using OSMesa, you should not need X running on any of the nodes.  It should be sufficient to have the OSMesa libraries and associated Mesa GL libraries installed on a shared folder.  However, make sure that folder is actually mounted everywhere (a common failure in my experience) and that they are the ones actually loaded for each node.

I'm sorry, I explained the problem very bad; we are using OSMesa library.

If we run pvserver only on the master node:

mpirun -np 2 pvserver --use-offscreen-rendering

It's all ok (even if DISPLAY variable is not set: we don't know if it's necessary).


If we try to use 2 nodes (master and node1), running this command on the master node:

mpirun -x LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/user/ParaView/ParaView-bin/bin/:/usr/lib/:/home/user/ParaView/ComponentiAggiuntivi/lib -np 2 -machinefile /home/user/ParaView/NodesList /home/user/ParaView/ParaView-bin/bin/pvserver --use-offscreen-rendering

the error is:

X is running on the second node (called node1); DISPLAY is not set neither on node master nor in the second node.
Must X server run on each node and must DISPLAY variable to be set also if we are using OSMesa library?

Must we install OSMesa on each node or it's enough to have installed that library on a shared folder (/home/user/ParaView/Components/lib) in the master node?

Have you any other idea?

Thank you very much for your patience

By "usual error" do you mean the crash in the GL or pthreads library?  It could be that the environment in the non-master nodes is incorrect.

Hi ken, thanks again.

we recompiled again OSMesa library (only on the master node of our cluster; the libraries file are generated on a shared folder - /home/user/ParaView/Components/lib - visible on each node), then we recompiled Paraview with these libraries (and setting shared libraries=off in ccmake menu); now we are able to connect the client with pvserver provided that pvserver runs only on the master node.

If we run pvserver on two or more nodes with the command:

mpirun -x LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/user/ParaView/Components/lib -np 2 -machinefile NodesList pvserver --use-offscreen-rendering

we always get the usual error when we try to connect the client with the server

Must X server run on each node? Currently X server is not running on any node (if we execute "pidof X" we obtain nothing) and DISPLAY variable is not set, but we can connect the client with the master node...

Have you any idea? Can you help us?

(Responding back to the ParaView list.)

These symbols should be defined in the GL library that is part of Mesa.  You should have a library like /home/myuser/TempOSMesa/Mesa-7.6/lib/libGL.so.  That is where the symbols should be defined.  libOSMesa.so simply references those libraries.  It is because the symbols cannot be found in the GL library that you are getting the error.  You can use the 'nm' command to query what symbols are defined are what are required.

It sounds like you are still linking to the system OpenGL libraries somehow.  Those symbols should be defined in the libGL.so that is built with Mesa (whereas the /usr/lib/libGL.so on your system probably does not have them).


Hi Ken,
thanks again.

Looking the errors such as:

"home/myuser/TempOSMesa/Mesa-7.6/lib/libOSMesa.so: undefined reference to `_mesa_free_context_data'"

I believe those symbols must be defined in libOSMesa.so library and not in /usr/lib/libGL.so library.

In fact, if we install OSMessa using Debian packages we can compile ParaView, but we can't connect client and server; the error always is similar to:

ParaView3/Servers/Common/vtkServerConnection.cxx, line 67
vtkServerConnection (0x3182220): Server Connection Closed!

If instead we compile OSMesa ourselves we can't compile ParaView: I believe that something went wrong compiling OSMesa (some simbols aren't present in libOSMesa.so created), but I don't know if compiling OSMesa ourselves can help us to resolve our problem.

We also tried to install on our cluster ParaView 3.6.1already compiled (downloaded from http://www.paraview.org/paraview/resources/software.html) and it works: we can establish client-server connection.

But if we try to run more 2 or more pvserver instances on the same node (mpirun -np 2 pvserver), we have this error:

"vtkProcessModuleConnectionManager (0x23d6da0): Failed to set up server socket"


 Did you do a clean build of ParaView (that is, delete the binary directory and start over from scratch)?  If you just tried to change some CMake variables in an existing build, you may have some stale libraries built.

We did "make clean".

You should also check to make sure that the executables being built are linking to your compiled Mesa libraries instead of the system libraries.  You can check this with the ldd command.  You may have to set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to point to /home/myuser/TempOSMesa/Mesa-7.6.

We also tried to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

Can you help us?

We compiled Mesa with:

Not really, but I would consider trying downloading the Mesa source and compiling it myself.  Since the error is happening somewhere in the OpenGL libraries (and is not really being replicated on other user's platforms), the only cause I can come up with is a problem with the libraries (and mismatched libraries is the most common problem).  Compiling Mesa is actually pretty easy, so it is worth taking the effort to check.

No, we didn't compile OSMesa ourselves, but we installed OSMesa library on each node downloading the .deb packages with:

Could it be a problem with mismatched libraries?  I notice in the error below that it occurs in /usr/lib/libGL.so.1.  This is a system library.  Did you compile OSMesa yourself?  If so, then you should not be using the system GL libraries; you should be using the libraries that you compiled when you also generated the OSMesa library.

Hi,
we have a Linux (Debian) cluster without gpu and we have a big problem using Paraview 3.6.1in client - server mode.
The server has been compiled with OSMesa library and following the instructions reported here (in particular the section "OSMesa support"):

http://www.itk.org/Wiki/Setting_up_a_ParaView_Server

If we try to connect the client started with the command:

paraview

and the server, started with the command:

pvserver --use-offscreen-rendering

we must disable the checkbox "Remote rendering threshold" (but this causes bad performances) in the client settings (Edit -> Settings -> Render view -> Server), othervise Paraview crashes after loading a big input or performing some operation such us changing "outline" to "wireframe"...

The error always is (similar to):

ParaView3/Servers/Common/vtkServerConnection.cxx, line 67
vtkServerConnection (0x3182220): Server Connection Closed!

Executing with: 0
*** Process received signal ***

*** End of error message ***
Segmentation fault


This error also occurs if we start client and server logging directly (without any ssh connection) on the master node; on master node X is running and we can execute the test:

mpirun -np 4 /usr/X11R6/bin/glxgears

So, it doen't seem a problem regarding X connection and permission...

Moreover, executing the test:

/ParaView/ParaView-bin$ ctest -I ,,10

we obtain some segmentation fault, but the log file can't give any useful information.

..

On our local machine with gpu 100% test passed, and we haven't any problem to connect client and server on that machine.


MPI version is: mpirun (Open MPI) 1.2.7rc2
OSMesa version is: 7.0.3-7


We searched on google, on Paraview wiki... without any succes: can you help us please?

If you need more information let us now

Thank you very much

Hi Ken,

it seems to have solved the problems. I say that with fingers crossed, I 
haven't seen holes any since your suggested changes, where before I was 
seeing them quite often, popping up from time to time.

Message-ID: <AB48A31C4EC97E498F4235B7CEF74A1901E550B9F2@MBX00.d.ethz.ch>

Hello

I have a reader creating 3 output ports (1 AMR and 2 vtkMultiBlock). Execution is fine, but the 3 eye icons left of the objects in the pipeline browser are now missing. My most recent CVS checkout was on December 4. Everything was right. I updated today, and the icons are now missing. 

I can still turn visibility ON/OFF via the python shell, but the icons are gone. Did I miss a change in the source code which requires modifying my own reader?
 (I have not changed my reader,) I just updated my cvs version of PV3, from december 4 to today.

thanks for any tip.

Thank you!
It works now!
I simply had to select the result of the integration (the point in the 3D
View) with "SelectPointsThrough". "SelectPointsOn" didn't work.

Utkarsh,

The spreadsheet view is more functional now, but it still doesn't seem
to work properly. Here is the procedure:

1) Load a vtp file with points and vertices
2) GenerateIds for the points
3) Split screen vertically
4) click "Spreadsheet view"
5) click in the points window to "activate" it
6) "select points on" some of my points
7) Click "show only selected elements" in the spreadsheet view
8) with "showing" set to "points.vtp" or "GenerateIds1", I don't see
the points that I have selected.

Am I doing something wrong or is there a bug? Can you reproduce this?

Thanks,

David

Message-ID: <c19fcadc0912110447x60b1d76do14cdb17c8ff3d263@mail.gmail.com>

Would it be possible to make a mode where when you hover over (or
click on?) a point its ID (index) pops up in a balloon? I typically
use the spreadsheet view to get a points ID, but this seems like using
a sledge hammer to kill a fly. This seems like a very common operation
that could be a bit easier.

Thoughts?

Thanks,

David,

I couldn't reproduce this. Try with a simple Sphere. Can you still reproduce it?

Subject: [Paraview] Filter input types
Message-ID: <BAY109-W17AB89CBBA3879F508EE92B28C0@phx.gbl>


I wrote a filter inherited from vtkPolyDataAlgorithm.
As far as I have understood, such a filter is supposed to produce a vtkPolyData but may use any kind of dataset as input.
The problem is I get an error because my input is an ImageData set while a PolyData is expected.
Any idea of what I missed in my code?

Hi Fred,

Quoting from the vtkPolyDataAlgorithm doc:
"This class also provides a FillInputPortInfo method that by default says
that all inputs will be PolyData. If that isn't the case then please
override this method in your subclass."

You will find a lot of VTK classes that override the
FillInputPortInformation method. It shouldn't be too difficult.

Subject: [Paraview] Parallel Data Redistribution
Message-ID: <AB48A31C4EC97E498F4235B7CEF74A1901E54611A1@MBX00.d.ethz.ch>

I have a filter pipeline which reads N blocks from disk, this works fine on N processors. 

I now wish to subdivide those N blocks (using a custom filter) to produce new data which will consist of M blocks - where M >> N.

I wish to run the algorithm on M processors and have the piece information transformed between the two filters (reader -> splitter), so that blocks are distributed correctly. The reader will Read N blocks (leaving M-N processes unoccupied), but the filter which splits them up needs to output a different number of pieces and have the full M processes receiving data.

I have a reasonably good idea of how to implement this, but I'm wondering if any filters already do something similar. I will of course take apart the D3 filter for ideas, but I don't need to do a parallel spatial decomposition since my blocks are already discrete - I just want to redistribute the blocks around and more importantly change the numbers of them between filters.

If anyone can suggest examples which do this already, please do

Thanks

JB

What is the data type? vtkRedistributePolyData and its subclasses do
this for polydata. It can do load balancing (where you can specify a
weight for each processor) as well.

Berk

The data will be UnstructuredGrid for now. Multiblock, but actually, I don't really care what each block is, only that I accept one block on each of N processes, split it into more pieces, and the next filter accepts one (or more if the numbers don't match up nicely) blocks and process them. The redistribution shouldn't care what data types, only how many blocks in and out.

Looking at RedistributePolyData makes me realize my initial idea is no good. In my mind I had a pipeline where multiblock datasets are passed down the pipeline and simply the number of pieces is manipulated to achieve what I wanted - but I see now that if I have M pieces downstream mapped upstream to N pieces, what will happen is the readers will be effectively duplicated and M/N readers will read the same pieces. I don't want this to happen as IO will be a big problem if readers read the same blocks M/N times. 
I was hoping there was a way of simply instructing the pipeline to manage the pieces, but I see now that this won't work, as there needs to be a specific Send from each N to their M/N receivers (because the data is physically in another process, so the pipeline can't see it). This is very annoying as there must be a class which already does this (block redistribution, rather than polygon level redistribution), and I would like it to be more 'pipeline integrated' so that the user doesn't have to explicitly send each time an algorithm needs it.

I'll go through RedistributePolyData in depth and see what I can pull out of it - please feel free to steer me towards another possibility :)

JB

It sounds like M is equal to the number of processors (pipelines) and
M >> N. Is that correct?

We have thought about this a bit in the past and we think that it is a
great idea. Implementing it efficiently on all modes ParaView supports
is not trivial though. We would still like to do it at one point.

It works properly with a sphere source. Try it with these points though:

I can't get it to display anything about them in the spread sheet view.

Subject: [Paraview] Calculator and Python
Message-ID: <14f7c4810912110844n5bd0eff9s9484f6b5f11f9158@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I'm trying to programm the Calculator with the help of Python to automate
the pipeline.
Isn't it possible to see the changes in the GUI?
I tried it like this:

calc=Calculator()
calc.Function='Normals.U' #Pointproduct of two Vectors U and Normals
calc.ResultArrayName='newResult'
calc.ReplaceInvalidResults=0
calc.UpdatePipeline()
Show()

but in the GUI, it didn't change.
In the shell the values are changed. (If I press "Apply" in the GUI, the
values change back (ok, thats not a bug))

I think the Calculator Filter isn't really "Apply"ed after that. I don't get
any result if I'm adding a IntegrateVariablesFilter on this.

Has somebody the same problems?

Thank you,

Dominic

Odd, works fine for me.
Are you sure you are looking at the same "Generate Ids" source in the
spreadsheet view? Make sure the same source is visible in both the
views.

Hm, it works if I generate the Ids then save the result to a file and
open that file. If I try to select points directly on the GenerateIds1
and set "showing" to GenerateIds1" the spreadsheet view is empty when
I select points. It seems that when I select points in GenerateIds1
the pipeline browser switches back to highlighting the input file. If
I "mess around" (ie. turn some things on and off etc (I can't figure
out exactly what is fixing it)) then try again, it works.

Maybe we should just ignore this and hopefully it will present
somewhere else that makes it more straightforward to see/fix?

Thanks,

David

Yes, That's the idea. N blocks, broken (in place) into M new blocks, then fanned out to the M processes downstream where they can be processed separately . If it were on a single node, then each block could be a separate 'connection' to a downstream filter, but distributed, an explicit send is needed.

Subject: [Paraview] How to push a value to the ServerManager so it gets
	pushed down to the Server
Message-ID: <C156BECB-A285-4AFD-BF58-A24BD7AC5418@bluequartz.net>

In my ServerManager XML file I have the following:

     <IntVectorProperty
       name="ActiveDimension"
       command="SetActiveDimension"
       number_of_elements="1"
       default_values="0"
       information_only="1">
     </IntVectorProperty>

And in my Client GUI code (which extends pqLoadedFormObjectPanel) I  
have the following code:
   vtkSMProperty* smProperty = this->proxy()- 
 >GetProperty("ActiveDimension");
   if (NULL == smProperty)
   {
     DebugTrace(<< "SMProperty was NULL for 'ActiveDimension'" );
   }
   vtkSMIntVectorProperty* activeDimProperty =  
vtkSMIntVectorProperty::SafeDownCast(smProperty);
   activeDimProperty->SetElement(0, index);

Doing a std::cout on the server side indicates that the Server side  
property (ActiveDimension) is NOT getting set. What exactly am I doing  
wrong?

  I would also like to have a QComboBox in the Gui that is hooked up  
to a server side property. What is the best way to go about that?

Thanks

I would have the reader (most parallel readers do this) generate empty
data on all processes of id >= N. Then your filter can redistribute
from those N processes to all M processes. I am pretty sure
RedistributePolyData can do this for polydata as long as you set the
weight to 1 on all processes. Ditto for D3.

Are you forgetting a this->proxy()->UpdateVTKObjects() call after you
have changed the value?

Yes, I did not know about that, but adding it still did not help.

That was not intended to be a solution, but rather a diagnostic.  My guess is that there are precision errors in the rasterization when the viewport is shifted.  Could you restore vtkIceTRenderManager and try the attached patch to IceT?

Hi Ken,

it seems to have solved the problems. I say that with fingers crossed, I
haven't seen holes any since your suggested changes, where before I was
seeing them quite often, popping up from time to time.

Why do you have the "information_only" attribute ? That's used only
for properties whose value are obtained from the server -side and are
never pushed "to"  the server. Simply remove that attribute, and it
should work -- I think.

Well,
   That helped. At least something is getting set on the server side  
now. Copy-Paste error. Doh. Alas, the value getting set is not the  
correct value.

Subject: [Paraview] Problems getting Vector plots ....
Message-ID: <4B2424EE.30901@hiwaay.net>



.... I am trying to use Paraview to view results from a Control-Volume 
CFD code (all variables calculated & stored at cell centers). After 
(apparently) whiffing w/ the legacy VTK ASCII format, I added some code 
to write out an XML file (also legacy VTK) w/ the grid & solution 
quantities. I can get it successfully imported into Paraview (3.2.1 & 
3.6.1.fc11) & see the grid & any raster plots (Gouraud) of various 
scalars, as well as velocity magnitude. I can't figure out how to get 
vector plots, however, & haven't (yet) located an example somewhere on 
the website. Any pointers on that topic ? TIA for your time & any clues.

Thanks for the pointer, that did some good, however the 'vectors' seem 
to only involve 1 component (X-direction) .... & all are positive (wrong 
for this data. Ring any bells :-) ? TIA ....

If the elements you want to display in you combobox are always the same,
simply use:

   <IntVectorProperty
     name="ActiveDimension"
     command="SetActiveDimension"
     number_of_elements="1"
     default_values="0">
        <EnumerationDomain name="enum">
          <Entry value="1" text="X"/>
          <Entry value="2" text="Y"/>
          <Entry value="3" text="Z"/>
        </EnumerationDomain>
   </IntVectorProperty>

and then rename you combobox to "ActiveDimension" in qt designer.

That's should be enough to do what you are looking for.

If you want to fill dynamically your combobox depending on some inputs, it's
harder than that but can be done.

for you first question, you can always use immediate_update=1 instead of
information_only to make sure that your value is pushed immediately to the
server.

Just FYI I created a request for this on uservoice:

https://paraview.uservoice.com/pages/11350-general/suggestions/415055-create-an-xml-file-syntax-checker

Should uservoice requests also be submitted on Mantis?

Thanks,

Thanks David.
Adding it myself and submitting a patch would also be possible, but perhaps in Jan.
In the meantime I just converted it from obj to vtk legacy format to get going quickly.

Hello,

I installed paraview with open mpi following the instructions on paraview.org/wiki. 

But when I ran 

mpirun -np 12 ./pvserver

the pvserver complained it didn't find shared library libvtkPVServerCommon.so. I checked the lib/ in the installation direction and found the library.  I am just wondering what can goes wrong.

Thanks in advance!

Hi Huan,

Note: By installing, I am guessing you mean that you compiled and
installed ParaView. The binaries we distribute do not have MPI
support.

Which version of ParaView did you compile and how did you install it?
It sounds like the search path ParaView uses for finding shared
libraries is not setup properly. There are two reasons (that I can
think of) why this may happen:

1. Modified installation of ParaView
2. ParaView is configured/compiled with VTK_USE_RPATH set to OFF. This
happens when using a development version of ParaView by default (i.e.
checkout of trunk from cvs) or if you explicitly turn off
VTK_USE_RPATH

Best,
-berk

That's not necessary. We'll move the request to the bug tracker when
it's accepted.

There's seems to be a bug with Calculator panel, that it does not
respect the value set using the python shell.
I've added it to the bug tracker:

Unfortunately the values that are stored in the QComboBox are read  
from the data file. The "workaround" that i was able to implement was  
to create the correct number of QTextEdit widgets and place them in  
the Gui in QtDesigner. Then in my constructor for my Panel Class, I  
simply call "setVisible(false)" on each of those QTextEdit widgets so  
they do not show up in the GUI. I then add in the appropriate logic  
using Signals/Slots to keep those invisible widgets up to date.
    Seems kinda of klunky but frankly there is not enough  
documentation in ParaView to stray from what is in the Wiki. There is  
mention that I need to implement some sort of "adaptor" for things  
like this (QRGB to RGB) is used as the example, but no actual  
implementation details so I, as the programmer, am basically left  
guessing what to try to implement.

   Thanks for the suggestion though. Keep them coming. Better, yet,  
would be places in the ParaView source to look for "examples" besides  
grepping through the sources for key words.

Hi Berk,

Yes, I downloaded the source code of version 3.6.1. And I checked the
VTK_USE_RPATH and it was on. 
The only warning I got when configuring paraview with ccmake is I am
using QT 4.6, whereas the official support is 4.3. 
Could that be a problem?

Thanks a lot for the help!

Huan

If you set VTK_USE_RPATH to OFF, recompile and reinstall, the problem
should disappear. Alternatively, you can set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to
where the ParaView libraries are. You need to do that such that the
processes launched by OpenMPI get this LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

I realised that adding LD_LIBRARY_PATH doesn't work when it requires
another plugin - but adding the REQUIRED_PLUGINS in the CMakeLists.txt
works :)

Berk,

We had a discussion back in 2008, which resides here http://www.cmake.org/pipermail/paraview/2008-May/008170.html

Continuing from this, my question of the other day, touches on the same problem.

I'd like to manipulate the piece number read by each reader. As mentioned before, UPDATE_PIECE is not passed into RequestInformation at first (since nobody knows how many pieces there are yet!), so I can't (directly) generate information in the reader which is 'piece dependent'. And I can't be sure that someone doing streaming won't interfere with piece numbers when using the code differently.

For the particle tracer (for example), I'd like to tell the upstream pipeline to read no pieces when certain processes are empty of particles (currently they update and generate{=read} data when they don't need to). I may be able to suppress the forward upstream somehow, but I don't know of an easy way for the algorithm to say "Stop" to the executive to prevent it updating if the timestep changes, but the algorithm has determined that no processing is required (ForwardUpstream of Requests continues unabated). I'd like to set the UPdatePiece to -1 to tell the executive to stop operating.

Also : for dynamic load balancing, I'd like to instruct several reader to read the same piece - since the algorithm controls (for example) the particles the algorithm can internally communicate information about what to do amongst its processes, but it can't talk upstream to the readers and fudge them.

I am wondering if there is any way of supporting this kind of thing using the current information keys and my instinct says no. It seems like the update pice and numpieces were really intended for streaming and we need two kinds of 'pieces', one for streaming, another for splitting in _parallel_ because they aren't quite the same. (Please note that I haven't actually tried changing piece requests in the algorithms yet, so I'm only guessing that it won't work properly)

<cough>
UPDATE_STREAM_PIECE
UPDATE_PARALLEL_PIECE 
<\cough>

Comments?

Hmmm. I don't exactly see the difference between the two (I mean
streaming and distributing). In your case, I would think that a filter
can arbitrarily change the pipeline request to either request nothing
or ask the same piece on two processes. It would like this:

reader0 - request piece 0 of 1 - filter - request piece 0 of 1 -
update suppressor
reader1 - request piece 0 of 1 - filter - request piece 1 of 1 -
update suppressor

This should work fine as long as the reader does not have another
consumer (for example a representation if the visibility is on) that
is asking for a different piece. The following should also work

reader0 - request piece 0 of 1 - filter - request piece 0 of 1 -
update suppressor
reader1 - request piece 0 of 0 - filter - request piece 1 of 1 -
update suppressor

Of course, if you have any filters that do parallel communication in
between, you are SOL.

Does that make sense?

Now if you have structured data and the frickin' extent translator
gets in between, things are not as straightforward - which why I hate
the extent translator. If I had some time/funding, I would write a new
executive that does not use structured extents.

I see. I already had the same kind of problems but am not able to help much
because there is no enough details in your message. Am not sure if it's a
reader or a filter that you are developing ? are you reading the file on the
client side ? server side ? or both ?

2 potential problems:
- if you are reading the file on both the server and client side, your
plugin will not work when the server is running on different computer
because the file will not be accessible to one of them.

- apply your plugin, save the state, delete all objects and reload the
state, probably something will go wrong.

if you give more details, I'll probably be able to help.

I am developing both a reader (Server Side only) and a custom GUI to  
go along with the reader for the client side. I have all sorts of  
custom Qt Gui widgets in my Reader Gui Plugin and I was hoping to  
reuse a bunch of code that was already existing.

   I have created some plugins (Server side reader with Client side  
custom gui) for ParaView in the past, but all of those plugins used  
simple QWidgets. Nothing like what I am trying now.

  My code is in a publicly accessible git repo if you want to take a  
look at the code.

I think the part that John wants that is missing is the ability for a filter to say I want no data (or simply, I don't care).  The idea being that during the RequestUpdateExtent phase you could send a flag to tell the pipeline to not propagate the request upstream.  Instead, simply call RequestData and propagate back down.  However, like Berk said, this is a bad idea because any upstream objects that do parallel communication will lock up.  I would hope that your reader itself does parallel communication.  You're going to get contention on your disks otherwise as different processes request the same pieces.

I suppose the filter could also simply request piece -1 and the reader could take that as a flag to read nothing.  Assuming neither the executive or another filter tries to do anything with the piece number you should be OK, but I don't know if that will just work.

Hmmm. I don't exactly see the difference between the two (I mean
streaming and distributing). In your case, I would think that a filter
can arbitrarily change the pipeline request to either request nothing
or ask the same piece on two processes. It would like this:

reader0 - request piece 0 of 1 - filter - request piece 0 of 1 -
update suppressor
reader1 - request piece 0 of 1 - filter - request piece 1 of 1 -
update suppressor

This should work fine as long as the reader does not have another
consumer (for example a representation if the visibility is on) that
is asking for a different piece. The following should also work

reader0 - request piece 0 of 1 - filter - request piece 0 of 1 -
update suppressor
reader1 - request piece 0 of 0 - filter - request piece 1 of 1 -
update suppressor

Of course, if you have any filters that do parallel communication in
between, you are SOL.

Does that make sense?

Now if you have structured data and the frickin' extent translator
gets in between, things are not as straightforward - which why I hate
the extent translator. If I had some time/funding, I would write a new
executive that does not use structured extents.

As mentioned before, UPDATE_PIECE is not passed into RequestInformation at first (since nobody knows how many pieces there are yet!), so I can't (directly) generate information in the reader which is 'piece dependent'. And I can't be sure that someone doing streaming won't interfere with piece numbers when using the code differently.

I may be able to suppress the forward upstream somehow, but I don't know of an easy way for the algorithm to say "Stop" to the executive to prevent it updating if the timestep changes, but the algorithm has determined that no processing is required (ForwardUpstream of Requests continues unabated). I'd like to set the UPdatePiece to -1 to tell the executive to stop operating.

It seems like the update pice and numpieces were really intended for streaming and we need two kinds of 'pieces', one for streaming, another for splitting in _parallel_ because they aren't quite the same. (Please note that I haven't actually tried changing piece requests in the algorithms yet, so I'm only guessing that it won't work properly)

In the past we had the pipeline execution stop if update number of
pieces was 0. We can easily add that back in. It would be a one line
change in vtkStreamingDemandDrivePipeline::NeedToExecuteData().

Alternatively, the reader could check for UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_PIECES and
do nothing it is is 0. I think that's better that requested piece
being -1 which is ambiguous.

In either case, I'm thinking this is not a great idea if the filter John is writing is intended to be used with anything other than his special reader.  Otherwise, the reader is going to get the request and do something unpredictable.

Maybe a safer approach is to make a new key like UPDATE_NO_DATA.  The filter could then set request some arbitrary piece and number of pieces and also add UPDATE_NO_DATA to its input.  If the reader understand UPDATE_NO_DATA, it will not actually read the data requested.  If it does not understand, it will simply read a piece that is ignored: no big deal.  That said, is this adding unnecessary complications to the pipeline mechanisms (which are already difficult for reader/filter designers)?

You can do this without making any changes to the executives. Set
UPDATE_NO_DATA in RequestUpdateExtent(), also add it to the request's
KEYS_TO_COPY entry. The executive would then copy it up the pipeline
all the way to the reader. One possible issue: if you want to make a
new pass without UPDATA_NO_DATA, you have to manually modify reader as
NeedToExecuteData() would not take UPDATA_NO_DATA into account. I
would like to have a general mechanism in the pipeline that causes it
to re-execute if the user requests a different value than a previous
one in such cases. It would be pretty straightforward but I never had
the time.

Hi Berk,

Thanks for the help. Setting the RPATH solves the problem of finding
the libraries.

Subject: [Paraview] compiling paraview against mpich2
Message-ID: <1260914407.7124.6.camel@huan-laptop>

Hello,

I was trying to compile paraview against mpich2.
I wonder if I need to specify some extra mpi libraries the cmake
configuration. I don't have a root account so i built the mpich2 under
my own account. So ccmake cannot find it. 

Also, can I compile paraview against staticly built mpi libraries? 

Thanks,

Huan

You need to link to both the mpi and mpicxx libs. Put one in
MPI_LIBRARIES and the other in MPI_EXTRA_LIBRARIES (or use path
separator.)

I do not think it it matters whether mpich is compiled statically or not.

Here is a very obscure trick. First, delete all CMake variables that
start with MPI_. To do this in ccmake, you have to first switch to
advanced view, file the MPI_ variables and hit 'd' next to each one to
delete them. Next, set the MPI_COMPILER to the mpicxx that is in your
MPI version. Next configure. CMake should pick all the right MPI
settings.

Subject: [Paraview]  how to configure display wall
Message-ID: <636847370912151743n383998basdf085c31e8f1d1d8@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all ,

I installed Paraview on two machines using MPI compiler. When I ran *
pvserver* on one machine as a server and ran *paraview* on the other as a
client , and then I connected the client to the server, it worked well. Now
I want to render  a sample dataset  and show the results on a tiled display
wall,that is , the two monitors connected to the client and the server. But
I have no idea how to make this happen. Can someone give me some help?

Thanks in advance.

Hi,

Thanks for the help. Somehow cmake didn't find the correct mpiexec -- it
did find the libmpichcxx.so. I fixed the mpiexec, compiled and
installed.
But when i ran ./pvserver --ldd (results attached below)
It seems that the paraview didn't find libmpichcxx. 
I installed mpich2 under my local account and put the lib path into
LD_LIBRARY_PATH. 
I wonder if you could help me figure out what happened. 

Thanks!

Huan

Hi,

Can anyone explain why the following warnings are appearing when I open the
Python Shell? This only appears to be happening on my machine in interactive
mode (using pvpython or pvbatch, I don't get these messages). 

>>> from paraview.simple import *
Warning: Clip is being overwritten. This may point to an issue in the
ParaView configuration files
Warning: Clip is being overwritten. This may point to an issue in the
ParaView configuration files
Warning: PlotSelectionOverTime is being overwritten. This may point to an
issue in the ParaView configuration files
Warning: FlattenFilter is being overwritten. This may point to an issue in
the ParaView configuration files
Warning: ProcessIdScalars is being overwritten. This may point to an issue
in the ParaView configuration files
Warning: UpdateSuppressor2 is being overwritten. This may point to an issue
in the ParaView configuration files
Warning: WarpByVector is being overwritten. This may point to an issue in
the ParaView configuration files
Warning: WarpByVector is being overwritten. This may point to an issue in
the ParaView configuration files
paraview version 3.7.0, Date: 2009-10-03
>>>

Fortunately, they don't appear to be having any effect on my scripts, so it
isn't a big issue but I'd like to understand why it is happening when I
haven't touched anything. I'm using ParaView 3.6.2-RC1.

Cheers,

Adriano

Hi Adriano,

Sounds familiar to me. I reported this a while back to Mantis:

Message-ID: <c9adba420912160302v385470f8o951c7fea1f48d883@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Is it possible to have multiple vector arrays for point data?  By
using the "SetVector" method it will overwrite any previous vector
values.  The other option I have tried is to use "AddArray" but this
does not work properly with a transform as the vector array added with
"SetVector" will get transformed but vector arrays added with
"AddArray" do not.  Ideally I would like to be able to set the array
type.

Thanks,
Paul

Hello,
I write a plugin reader. And this reader reads data which is time dependent.
So in RequestInformation I set the different values for steps and the min
and max value of time like this :

for(int i=0;i<nbtimesteps;i++)

outInfo->Append(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::TIME_STEPS(),timeStep[i]);

timeRange[0]=time_min;
timeRange[1]=time_max;
outInfo->Set(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::TIME_RANGE(), timeRange, 2);

nbtimsteps is the number of steps.
and timeSteps[i] is the value of the time at the step i.



In RequestData I write the following line to see the value of
UPDATE_TIME_STEPS.
if(outInfo->Has(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_TIME_STEPS()))
      {
          double step =
outInfo->Get(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_TIME_STEPS())[0];
          int nSteps =

outInfo->Length(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::TIME_STEPS());
          double* steps =

outInfo->Get(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::TIME_STEPS());
          std::cout << "Step : "<<step<<endl;
          for(int i=0;i<nSteps;i++)
          {
            std::cout << "steps : "<<steps[i]<<endl;
          }
      }

 when I display
outInfo->Get(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_TIME_STEPS())[0] for
the first time value,
I expected to have my first value of my timeStep, but I have 0.
And if I click on the next frame button in paraview, the next value is
0.1111111.

I don't understand what I am doing wrong.

Thanks,
Didier

PS : I use paraview 3.7

Have a look at the time presentation on the paraview wiki under IEEE 2008 tutorial. you need XML + RequestInformation and then it should work

You have to run a single MPI job over both of your machines and then turn on tiled display with the -tdx and -tdy flags.  I added some details to the Wiki:

Hi all ,

I installed Paraview on two machines using MPI compiler. When I ran pvserver on one machine as a server and ran paraview on the other as a client , and then I connected the client to the server, it worked well. Now I want to render  a sample dataset  and show the results on a tiled display wall,that is , the two monitors connected to the client and the server. But I have no idea how to make this happen. Can someone give me some help?

Thanks in advance.

That's strange. Are you positive that you set LD_LIBRARY_PATH
correctly and you also exported the variable (assuming you are using
bash/ksh/zsh)?

Hi Berk,

Yeah, I have custom plugins and filters that are loaded automatically. I've
done some checking after the pointer from Sven, and it is definitely the
custom filters that are causing the issue. I tested filters that were
created with version 3.5.0 and 3.6.2-RC1 and both give these warnings if the
custom filters are loaded. What is strange is the warning itself doesn't
appear to relate to any built-in filter used in the custom filter. For
example:

Custom Filter A:

Use:
	-> EnSight Reader
	-> Transform
	-> Extract Block
	-> Extract Surface
	-> Compute Surface Normals
	-> Calculator
	-> Integrate Variables

Error in python shell:

>>> from paraview.simple import *
Warning: Clip is being overwritten. This may point to an issue in the
ParaView configuration files
paraview version 3.7.0, Date: 2009-10-03
>>>

Clip filter isn't used at all. As I said, I'm using the release candidate
build, but the error has been reported by Sven as being in existance since
early October this year. 

Cheers,

Adriano

Hi Adriano,

Are you loading any plugin or do you have any custom filters?

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview 3.6.1 on Fedora 12 legend labels overdrawn
Message-ID: <2034674BF9D4714BAE35B22BF073EEF401B02362@MS-AFIT-02.afit.edu>

I'm using Paraview 3.6.1 on Fedora 12, and came across the problem
referenced in a previous message to this list
(http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2009-September/013774.html) in
that the legend labels seem to be drawn over each other.  I've attached a
screenshot showing this behavior.

As a comparison, I've looked to see if the same behavior is seen on another
distribution.  Also attached is a screenshot from Paraview 3.6.1 on CentOS
5.4, where the legend labels appear as they should.

Paraview on Fedora is from the default repositories, compiled with qt 4.5.3;
Paraview on CentOS 5 is compiled with qt 4.4.3 -- I wonder if the version of
qt makes a difference, although I've also compiled it with qt 4.5.2 on
CentOS 5 and there is no difference there.

Any ideas?

At a system level is the font dpi higher on fedora (there is typically some
gui way to adjust this)? Do any other labels render like that, or just
legends?

There was a bug in the python module due to which it reported the
wrong name as being overridden. Now it should report the correct name
-- I've committed a fix. You'd get this error if you named a custom
filter with the same name as the name  (or label) or any other
existing proxy.

There was a bug in the python module due to which it reported the wrong name
as being overridden. Now it should report the correct name
-- I've committed a fix. You'd get this error if you named a custom filter
with the same name as the name  (or label) or any other existing proxy.

It seems like you need to fix two things, just like what berk said, your
LD_LIBRARY_PATH is not set correctly. You need to add the path to the mpi
library to LD_LIBRARY_PATH, for example my LD_LIBRARY_PATH has
/usr/voltaire/mpi/lib

if that still doesn't work, its most likely that the cmake configuration
didn't get all the libraries you need, according to your error messages,
the easiest way is to locate the libraries it can't find and manually add
them to your 'MPI_EXTRA_LIBRARY' variable. It should work eventually

Thanks John.

I try , but I have problem with this:

this->ActualTimeStep = vtkstd::find_if(
    this->TimeStepValues.begin(), this->TimeStepValues.end(),
    vtkstd::bind2nd( WithinTolerance( ), requestedTimeValue ))
    - this->TimeStepValues.begin();


I have always this following build error :
error : 'find_if' is not a member of std.

I don't understand what I'm doing wrong.

This problem sounds totally unrelated to the first problem you reported.

Do you have #include <vtkstd/algorithm> at the top of your reader?  find_if is declared in this header.

Have a look at the time presentation on the paraview wiki under IEEE 2008 tutorial. you need XML + RequestInformation and then it should work

Hello,
I write a plugin reader. And this reader reads data which is time dependent.
So in RequestInformation I set the different values for steps and the min and max value of time like this :

for(int i=0;i<nbtimesteps;i++)
               outInfo->Append(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::TIME_STEPS(),timeStep[i]);

timeRange[0]=time_min;
timeRange[1]=time_max;
outInfo->Set(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::TIME_RANGE(), timeRange, 2);

nbtimsteps is the number of steps.
and timeSteps[i] is the value of the time at the step i.



In RequestData I write the following line to see the value of UPDATE_TIME_STEPS.
if(outInfo->Has(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_TIME_STEPS()))
      {
          double step = outInfo->Get(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_TIME_STEPS())[0];
          int nSteps =
                outInfo->Length(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::TIME_STEPS());
          double* steps =
                outInfo->Get(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::TIME_STEPS());
          std::cout << "Step : "<<step<<endl;
          for(int i=0;i<nSteps;i++)
          {
            std::cout << "steps : "<<steps[i]<<endl;
          }
      }

 when I display outInfo->Get(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_TIME_STEPS())[0] for the first time value,
I expected to have my first value of my timeStep, but I have 0.
And if I click on the next frame button in paraview, the next value is 0.1111111.

I don't understand what I am doing wrong.

Thanks,
Didier

PS : I use paraview 3.7

Subject: [Paraview] Bundleing PyQt/Sip with ParaView (on Mac)
Message-ID: <a44d4ae00912160855q3fbf6280u6cb4cb0b9dbfc1e@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

We are trying to figure out the ideal way to organize various python files
in a ParaView bundle.

The files that we will need are:

Python.frameWork/Version/2.3/bin/sip (executable)
Python.frameWork/Versions/2.3/share/sip/PyQt/*.sip (text files)

/Library/Python/2.3/site-packages/sip.so
/Library/Python/2.3/site-packages/Qt*.so (PyQt libraries)
/Library/Python/2.3/site-packages/*py (various PyQt and sip files).

The contents of our Bundle looks like:

Frameworks/
Libraries/
MacOS/
Plugins/
Python/
Resources/
Support/

We are thinking that we should put everything under Python. We are wondering
what you guys think, is this a consistent layout for standard Apple bundles?

Thanks!

Didier,

The find_if thing is really becuase in older paraview versions when the UPDATE_TIME_STEP was sent, it was sometimes rounded to float/double and slightly different from the declared value of time that the reader (for example) had really generated. All it does is find the closest time value to the ones you should have (actually, not closest, but one equal to or larger) - you don't rellay need it - at some point I'll update the tutorial. Leaving it in won't hurt and will at least ensure you get something meaningful.

JB

This problem sounds totally unrelated to the first problem you reported.

Do you have #include <vtkstd/algorithm> at the top of your reader?  find_if is declared in this header.

I try , but I have problem with this:

    vtkstd::bind2nd( WithinTolerance( ), requestedTimeValue ))
    - this->TimeStepValues.begin();


I have always this following build error :
error : 'find_if' is not a member of std.

I don't understand what I'm doing wrong.

Have a look at the time presentation on the paraview wiki under IEEE 2008 tutorial. you need XML + RequestInformation and then it should work

Hello,
I write a plugin reader. And this reader reads data which is time dependent.
So in RequestInformation I set the different values for steps and the min and max value of time like this :

for(int i=0;i<nbtimesteps;i++)
               outInfo->Append(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::TIME_STEPS(),timeStep[i]);

timeRange[0]=time_min;
timeRange[1]=time_max;
outInfo->Set(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::TIME_RANGE(), timeRange, 2);

nbtimsteps is the number of steps.
and timeSteps[i] is the value of the time at the step i.



In RequestData I write the following line to see the value of UPDATE_TIME_STEPS.
if(outInfo->Has(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_TIME_STEPS()))
      {
          double step = outInfo->Get(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_TIME_STEPS())[0];
          int nSteps =
                outInfo->Length(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::TIME_STEPS());
          double* steps =
                outInfo->Get(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::TIME_STEPS());
          std::cout << "Step : "<<step<<endl;
          for(int i=0;i<nSteps;i++)
          {
            std::cout << "steps : "<<steps[i]<<endl;
          }
      }

 when I display outInfo->Get(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_TIME_STEPS())[0] for the first time value,
I expected to have my first value of my timeStep, but I have 0.
And if I click on the next frame button in paraview, the next value is 0.1111111.

I don't understand what I am doing wrong.

Thanks,
Didier

PS : I use paraview 3.7

Hey John,

I guess you can kind of do this with the current "request update" stuff 
but thanks to the flexibility of the pipeline information key,values you 
can also roll your own very easy.

I recently implemented dynamic load balancing in a new stream line 
tracer. To get the work load balanced its crucial that each process have 
to have on demand access to the entire data set. I accomplished it with 
information keys and by using a "meta-reader" in place of the 
traditional paraview reader. The meta reader does two things, it 
populates the new keys and it gives PV a dummy dataset that is one cell 
per process such that the bounds, shape, and array names are the same as 
the real dataset which is not read during the meta-reader execution. 
When the stream tracer executes downstream of the meta-reader he picks 
the keys out of the pipeline information. The important key,value is an 
out-of-core (ooc) reader. The ooc reader is a vtkDataObject so that it 
can be passed through the information. Once the stream tracer has it he 
can make repeated IO requests as particles move through the dataset as 
needed. My interface accepts a point and returns a chunk of data. The 
ooc reader internally handles caching and memory management. In this way 
you can keep all processes busy all the time when tracing stream lines. 
The approach worked out well and was very simple to implement, with no 
modification to the executive. Also the filter has control of caching, 
and can free all the memory at the end of its execution which reduces 
significantly the memory footprint compared to the traditional PV 
reader. And I need not worry if PV or some upstream filter uses MPI 
communications in between during my IO requests. There is a little more 
to our scheduling algorithm which I wont discus now but so far for 
making poincare maps we scaled well up to 2E7 stream lines per frame and 
96 processes and we minimize the memory footprint which is important to us.

Berk and Ken already basically gave you all the options you need but I 
add this because it shows how flexible and powerful the pipeline 
information really is.

As mentioned before, UPDATE_PIECE is not passed into RequestInformation at first (since nobody knows how many pieces there are yet!), so I can't (directly) generate information in the reader which is 'piece dependent'. And I can't be sure that someone doing streaming won't interfere with piece numbers when using the code differently.

I may be able to suppress the forward upstream somehow, but I don't know of an easy way for the algorithm to say "Stop" to the executive to prevent it updating if the timestep changes, but the algorithm has determined that no processing is required (ForwardUpstream of Requests continues unabated). I'd like to set the UPdatePiece to -1 to tell the executive to stop operating.

It seems like the update pice and numpieces were really intended for streaming and we need two kinds of 'pieces', one for streaming, another for splitting in _parallel_ because they aren't quite the same. (Please note that I haven't actually tried changing piece requests in the algorithms yet, so I'm only guessing that it won't work properly)

Hi, I just found it's because I switched back and forth between tcsh and
bash and my library path is only defined in bash.
It's working now.

Thanks again for all the help!

Hmm, oddly the qhelpgenerator is segfaulting.
Not sure why. Does the configured
/local/data/jfavre/ParaView3Build/Documentation/paraview.qhp look
reasonable?

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview 3.6.1 on Fedora 12 legend labels overdrawn
Message-ID: <4B2986F2.2090700@gmail.com>

My apologies of this message appears twice -- I tried to send it from my 
work account earlier today, but it looks like it didn't go through.

I'm using Paraview 3.6.1 on Fedora 12, and came across the problem
referenced in a previous message to this list
(http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2009-September/013774.html) in
that the legend labels seem to be drawn over each other. I've attached a
screenshot showing this behavior.

As a comparison, I've looked to see if the same behavior is seen on another
distribution. Also attached is a screenshot from Paraview 3.6.1 on CentOS
5.4, where the legend labels appear as they should.

Paraview on Fedora is from the default repositories, compiled with qt 4.5.3;
Paraview on CentOS 5 is compiled with qt 4.4.3 -- I wonder if the version of
qt makes a difference, although I've also compiled it with qt 4.5.2 on
CentOS 5 and there is no difference there.

Any ideas?

Andrew

Subject: [Paraview] particle animation
Message-ID: <405346.98644.qm@web35306.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Dear ParaView experts:

I did a simple calculations of particle motion under magnetic fields using perl.  I would like to plot the particles as a function of time.
What format should I use to save for paraview to be able to read in?  The particles has attributes of: size, time, coordinate in X, coordinate in Y, and coordinate in Z.  The particles were initially randomly distributed within a (Xmin, Ymin, Xmax, Ymax) domain.  There is no mesh required.

Is there any examples/tutorials on something like this?

It will be highly appreciated if someone can point to me a direction.

Pei

Thanks Burlen, Berk, Ken - I'm digesting all the emails and rewriting a bunch of filters and readers to see if I can do everything with the UPDATE_PIECE keys and related exchanges of information.

I'll report back once I make some progress or need help.

cheers

Yes.

But not without writing code. If you look at vtkExtractDataOverTime (I don't recall the precise name from memory), it builds up an array of values one per time step. The trouble is if you want to change the code to pick the max at each time step, then at the end, scan each to return the real max (or update as it iterates over each step), then you need to modify the class (i.e. copy and paste most of it then edit the bits you want to change). I have several almost identical filters which do ExtractXXXOverTime and the code duplication is pointless. I have a plan to create some kind of adaptor class which ExtractsXXXOverTime with the user supplying the class to run at each time step so that all you need to do is override some functor like object to do the small bit of real code, and the donkey work is managed by the holder class.

Hi, Raashid,

I did search the mailing list before I posted the question.

I found some communication about practicle tracing, but, it seems that it is not quite what I am looking for (seems more complex than what I am trying to do).? I do not quite understand what the solution was either.

I will think that the people who do Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics must be doing this on daily basis.? And in my case, it is even simpler because I do not have to worry about flow field -> only the potions of the particles as a function of time.

Best,

Pei

I think this question has been asked and answered before.
You can search the earlier mailing list.

(Hmm, somehow this reply got past me yesterday -- so my earlier message
made it)

I've checked the dpi settings on both machines (CentOS and Fedora) and
they are both set at 96 dpi.

Is there anyone else that is using Paraview on Fedora 12 -- are you
seeing the same issue?

What happens if you run the binary from paraview.org? Also, do you see
this same problem with other labels - for example if you create a text
source or turn on the labels for the selection?

When you say "plot the particles as a function of time", do you mean
an animation or the paths of the particles in 2D?

(cc'ing back to ParaView list)

It looks like your pvserver is not compiled with MPI.  Are you using binaries you downloaded from Kitware?  That won't work.  You will have to compile pvserver yourself with MPI.  Again, details are on the Wiki.

Hi Ken,

Thank you  for your reply. But I am sorry that I am still not very clear about what to do.I have two nodes and on node2 I type the following command:

$cat machinefile
node2
node1
$mpdboot -n 2 -f machinefile
$mpdtrace
node2
node1
$mpirun -n 2 pvserver -display localhost:0 -tdx=2 -tdy=1
Listen on port: 11111
Waiting for client...
Listen on port: 11111

And then I run paraview on node1
$paraview

A GUI interface shows up and I  connect it to server node2 (File->Connect). Then I open a sample dataset(ParaViewData/Data/tube.exii) and press the button Apply,but I only see an image in the GUI interface on node1 and nothing on node2. I am new to ParaView, can you tell me what to do next? I really appreciate your help.

Hi all ,

I installed Paraview on two machines using MPI compiler. When I ran pvserver on one machine as a server and ran paraview on the other as a client , and then I connected the client to the server, it worked well. Now I want to render  a sample dataset  and show the results on a tiled display wall,that is , the two monitors connected to the client and the server. But I have no idea how to make this happen.

I'm using Fedora 12 on my laptop and I don't see anything like this. 
I've tried in a few minutes to install the paraview version coming with 
Fedora, loading a simple dataset and displaying the legend, everything 
works fine. I've also a compiled version of paraview which works fine as 
well, no corrupted text.
There might be something going wrong with your graphic card driver, if 
you have an nvidia card, I would recommend you to install the official 
nvidia driver and not the "nouveau" driver coming with Fedora.

You should be able to do it by applying a descriptive statistics filter and then selecting the row containing the variable you want and ploting the selection over time.  However, I see that several pieces of that are broken right now.  I'll start raising bugs to fix them.

Yes.

But not without writing code. If you look at vtkExtractDataOverTime (I don't recall the precise name from memory), it builds up an array of values one per time step. The trouble is if you want to change the code to pick the max at each time step, then at the end, scan each to return the real max (or update as it iterates over each step), then you need to modify the class (i.e. copy and paste most of it then edit the bits you want to change). I have several almost identical filters which do ExtractXXXOverTime and the code duplication is pointless. I have a plan to create some kind of adaptor class which ExtractsXXXOverTime with the user supplying the class to run at each time step so that all you need to do is override some functor like object to do the small bit of real code, and the donkey work is managed by the holder class.

The simplest thing to do is to create a series is to create a series
of csv files. Like foo1.csv, foo2.csv etc. Then you load this series
into ParaView. You apply Table to Points and Glyph (make sure to
switch to 3D view), then you hit play.

Note: ParaView does not support 2D data natively. You will have to add
a fake z value.

Hi, Berk,

I just realized that I still need to know the format of the csv file.? Can I use:
x,y,z,d (where d is the diameter of the particle)?? How will paraview know which colum to use to scale particle size (ie, d)?

I will have 1000 time steps.? Does it mean that I have to load the csv files indivisually?? Is there a possibility of using vtu/pvd format (still need to know the vtu/pvd format though)?

Pei

Not sure why. I tried building the ReaderPlugin in Examples provided
with ParaView, it seems to work exactly as expected. Take a look at
your plugin and compare it with the one in Examples/Plugins/Reader.
Make sure the xmls match up.

Yes, you can. You tell the Table to Points filter which columns to use
for x, y and z. Then you tell the glyph filter to use the remaining
column for scaling. Give it a try, you'll see.

ParaView can load a file series of csv files. If you  name them as
<name>0.csv, <name>1.csv, ...., ParaView will give you the option of
opening the whole series.

Yes, I saw that in an earlier situation that there may be something to do with nvidia cards, but the Fedora 12 machine (a laptop) has an intel graphics chip -- the CentOS machine has an nvidia card and it does _not_ show the problem...

Hi

I have tried various ways to get rid of this problem but fail. I guess it is related to the intel graphic card driver.

I have tried F10,F11,F12,paraview 3.4,3.6,either compiled or from the distribution repository.One method to kill the problem while using the laptop is change the "intel" to "vesa" driver,but with that generic driver I could not get 1200x800 screen resolution.

Yes, it does seem to be related to the intel graphics driver.  The 
problem does not show up with a clean installation of Fedora 12 in a 
virtual machine, but it does show up with a clean installation of Fedora 
12 on the native hardware.

That's too bad -- my machine also has a 1200x800 screen...

The problem is still there with the binary from paraview.org.

With a text source there isn't a problem, but with selection labels 
there is (see attachment).

Perhaps you are picking points which are visually coincident in this view ?

OK. Now that we have a guess about the source of the problem. I can
suggest a solution: compile ParaView with Mesa, software rendering
only. I'd recommend getting the Mesa source from mesa3d.org, compiling
and installing it. I wouldn't use the one that comes with your
distribution. ParaView will probably perform slightly worse than the
native Intel drivers but it should give you correct results.

No, this is a purely 2D dataset.

Subject: [Paraview] particle motion animation - can someone help?
Message-ID: <897525.639.qm@web35304.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Dear Paraview user group:

I would like to plot/animate the motion of particles.? The particles were initially randomly distributed within a Xmin Ymin Xmax Ymax domain.? The particles are then start to move toward a magnetic source.? I can done calculating the positions of each partcile at each time step.? What format should I use so that paraview can handle ploting/animate the positions of the particles? (the particle sizes are also randomly distributed, it will be nice to show the particle size based on the same scaling).

I made up 10 csv files each with x,y,z,d.? Each csv corresponds to each time step.? I am using paraview 3.6.1 (MS windows version).?

the filenames are output1.csv, output2.csv, output3.csv....

When I first opened the files, I chose output..csv (I think that this will open all the csv files).? Hit apply, I got output* in the pipeline browser.
Then, I did filter/TableToPoints and chose the X Column, Y Column, Z Column. Hit apply.
Then did "Split Horizontal" to create a new display window and select "3D View".
Then, Filter/Glyph. change Glyph type to sphere, change scale mode to scalar, hit apply.

This got me all the particles with correct size.
However, when I press "Play" button to animate, I got the following error:

ERROR: In ..\..\..\src\VTK\Graphics\vtkTableToPolyData.cxx, line 111
vtkTableToPolyData (06CC5D88): Failed to locate? the columns to use for the point coordinates

ERROR: In ..\..\..\src\VTK\Filtering\vtkExecutive.cxx, line 757
vtkCompositeDataPipeline (06CC6028): Algorithm vtkTableToPolyData(06CC5D88) returned failure for request: vtkInformation (06C661F0)
? Debug: Off

? Reference Count: 1
? Registered Events: (none)
? Request: REQUEST_DATA
? FROM_OUTPUT_PORT: 0
? FORWARD_DIRECTION: 0
? ALGORITHM_AFTER_FORWARD: 1
-----------------------------------------------

If I open each .csv file indivisually and go through the steps above (without the animation), I got a nice plot of the particles.? So, each csv file seems to be fine.

Did I miss any step so that animation does not work?

Pei

I attached the csv file I made up so that you can check if the csv files are not correctly formatted.

Since your csv files don't have any header column, make sure that you
uncheck the "Have Headers" check box on the reader panel.

Hi, Utkarsh,

Yap!? That is the issue.? After unchecked the "Have Headers" box, now I am able to animate through time.? Thansk a lot!? Now I am REALLY happy!

Wish you all the paraview developers/users have a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!

Pei

Subject: [Paraview] source with optional input port
Message-ID: <4B2C11FF.5050606@gmail.com>

Hi folks,

I'd like to have a PV data source that can be used either as a 
source(without an input dataset) or as a filter(with an input dataset). 
Based on what I have observed, to accomplish it the source has to show 
up both in the sources menu and the filters menu, which is easy to do 
with the XML by adding an entry in both the sources and filters groups 
that points back to the same class and base proxy. It all works except 
for sharing a custom qt panel between them, specifically sharing the 
panel across proxy groups isn't currently allowed.

The attached patch enables a custom panel to be shared across the 
sources/filters proxy groups. Assuming that this is the right way to 
accomplish this can this patch be committed?

Why would you want to do this?  For one example:
a source with an optional input used like a filter can then extract 
spatial bounds from the input dataset and then position itself 
automatically in the scene. This makes the source faster/easier to use 
than if you have to type in the coordinates to position it. There are 
plenty of other examples, with one thing in common, the potential to 
make the source easier/faster to use.

Burlen

It sounds like the link line is missing the C++ bindings for MPI. Can
you grep for MPI_ in the CMakeCache.txt file (in your binary tree)? I
would like to know that MPI_LIBRARY and MPI_EXTRA_LIBRARY are.

I've compiled a generic version of Mesa (using the basic make target 
linux-x86-64), and built Paraview 3.6.1 with the generic Mesa (as shown 
at 
http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/Setting_up_a_ParaView_Server#OSMesa_support) 
on the Fedora 12 machine with the label problem.  The attached 
screenshot shows that there is no longer any problem with the labels.

So, thanks for the tip -- using software rendering works.  Any hope to 
get hardware rendering to work with the intel video driver?

I've now narrowed the problem to libGL.so.  The libGL.so that ships with 
F12 is /usr/lib64/libGL.so.1.2, with /usr/lib64/libGL.so.1 pointing to 
it.  The version that I compiled from source (using the generic build 
instructions to get software rendering) is libGL.so.1.5.070601.  If I 
point /usr/lib64/libGL.so.1 to my new libGL (libGL.so.1.5.070601), *and 
run the version of Paraview that ships with F12* (not my customized 
build), then the label problem is not present.

I don't know if this is due to a newer version of libGL, or if it is 
because I compiled that version of libGL without hardware acceleration.  
Any insight from others?

I would like to keep the original version of libGL -- so I'd like 
Paraview to look for libGL.so.1.5, instead of libGL.so.1.  Perhaps I'll 
need to statically link Paraview to libGL? Any suggestions as to how 
best to keep the hardware accelerated version of libGL, but point 
Paraview to the in-software-only libGL?

You can choose a different version of OpenGL libraries by setting the
LD_LIBRARY_PATH. If it points to where the Mesa libraries are,
ParaView should use those first.

By the way, are you seeing any significant performance different
between Mesa and Intel drivers? Also, is there any way to enable Intel
support when compiling Mesa? I suspect that the Intel drivers are
already Mesa based.

Message-ID: <AB48A31C4EC97E498F4235B7CEF74A1901E7E6D697@MBX00.d.ethz.ch>


I am following the same method I use in multi-block readers to set names of individual grids ("Extract Block" in the GUI panel correctly identifies grids by names)

The same (using Extract AMRBlock) does not name my patches. The levels are named, but the patches are simply labeled with the default "Dataset %d", i.e. ignoring my own setting from:

   output->GetMetaData(levelId, boxId)->Set(vtkHierarchicalBoxDataSet::NAME(), tmpName);

Is there an easy fix to that?
TIA

The default Mesa libraries shipping with F12 are compiled with dri 
support.  I also rebuilt the latest version of Mesa to use the i915 dri 
driver, but the problem with labels is still there.

I have only been testing Paraview with a simple 2D dataset, so I don't 
know if there is a significant difference in performance.

I guess the problem is related to some incompatibility between the intel driver and the intel 4 series graphic card.I do not have such problem with the intel 3 series graphic card.

The Graphic Card:Intel Corporation Mobile 4 Series Chipset Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 07)

I believe that this was intentional as the number of patches can be in
thousands to hundreds of thousands. Getting that many strings from the
server and populating the GUI with them would be slow. If you look at
vtkPVDataInformation, there is a code that says something like:

  if (this->CompositeDataInformation->GetDataIsMultiPiece())
    {
    // For vtkMultiPieceDataSet, the vtkPVCompositeDataInformation does not
    // give us individual piece information, we collect that explicitly.
    this->AddFromMultiPieceDataSet(data);
    }
  else

vtkHierarchicalBoxDataSet uses multi-piece datasets to represent each
level so this code executes. You could probably (I am not 100% sure)
get rid of this if to make it work.

It looks like the problem is with the Mesa library using hardware 
rendering for the Intel video chipset (I'm using the i915 driver).  I'd 
like to submit a bug report upstream -- but I'm not at all familar with 
the Paraview code.  Where would I find the details of the label code 
where the problem is?  I'd at least like to point to some possible Mesa 
GL functions that are not implemented correctly in the i915 driver...

Unfortunately, there are a lot classes involved in the rendering of
text in VTK. The
code that actually renders the text in question is in
VTK/Rendering/vtkOpenGLFreeTypeTextMapper.cxx. Look at the
RenderOverlay method. Looking at the code, it looks like the main text
rendering is done by FTFont, which I am guessing is part of the
freetype library.

Message-ID: <766e07b20912210723x5cd20e8es129631f4c2e83abc@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
could you please explain the way to automatize a sequence of operations?

For example, suppose I always have to apply on every input:

1) slice filter (with some plane...)
2) contour filter (on some variable, with some values interval...)

We would like to apply automatically these two operations after loading a
generic input file.
W tried to use File -> Save state, but this saves the sequence and the
input, and we won't the input.

Thank you
Luis

Subject: [Paraview] Help with Python scripting for Calculator function.
Message-ID: <4919db420912210737o779a2cd4o57860f56a2e203e9@mail.gmail.com>

I'm trying to use python scripting to use the calculator.   I can't get the
function and the results to display in the GUI.

I first used the trace capabilities to generate a function and was able to
successfully generate my results on the GUI but when i shut down and
restarted and run the scripts just generated from the trace it doesn't
display the function in the
Object inspector.


Here's a sample python script that i'm using.

Calculator1 = Calculator()
Calculator1.AttributeMode = 'point_data'

# i'd like to display this function in the GUI
Calculator1.Function = 'Hdemag_Z*2'


Calculator1.ScalarVariable = ['Hdemag_X', 'Hdemag', '0', 'Hdemag_Y',
'Hdemag', '1', 'Hdemag_Z', 'Hdemag', '2', 'M_X', 'M', '0', 'M_Y', 'M', '1',
'M_Z', 'M', '2']
Calculator1.CoordinateScalarVariable = ['coordsX', '0', 'coordsY', '1',
'coordsZ', '2']
Calculator1.CoordinateVectorVariable = ['coords', '0', '1', '2']
Calculator1.VectorVariable = ['Hdemag', 'Hdemag', '0', '1', '2', 'M', 'M',
'0', '1', '2']
Calculator1.ResultArrayName = 'Heffective'
DataRepresentation5 = Show()
DataRepresentation4.Visibility = 1


Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Hi David, thank you very much.
Custom filter is useful but it doesn't seem to be exactly what we would.
In fact, with this filter we obtain the final result.
Instead, we would preserve in our pipeline all operation:

1) slice
2) contours
3)...

Can anyone help us?
Thank you

Luis,

With the 3.6.2 release candidate and the latest CVS you can use the Python tracing to build a Python script that does the operation you wish.  You can then edit the script if necessary and make a macro for it.

One of the intentions of the Python tracing/macro capability is to make creating solutions to these repetitive processes easy.  If you try this, let us know how it works for you.

Do both the legend labels and the cell/point labels use this method?

It looks like the code defines a binding between freetype and GL -- 
which would explain the Mesa part.

Many users have the problem so if you will please share your script with 
us when you have it working as many of us have minimal knowledge of 
python and to write such scripts.

That sounds reasonable, but specification of multiple group names and
xml names and the m*n matching between them seems funny. Any ideas on
how we can make that more explicit? What is the user wants the panel
for (readers, MyReader) and (filters, MyFilter) but not (readers,
MyFilter)? Not sure if it's even worth the trouble -- but just in case
you can think of a cleaner solution.

Subject: [Paraview] Relative values when Glyph is used makes problem
Message-ID: <4B2FD706.1070006@bredband.net>


Dear all,

I am using Paraview to show some simulation results. When I open my file
in Paraview I use Glyph and then Arrows to show current distribution
inside a volume. The problem is, let say in X-axis, have very larges
values comparing to others. For example, while all values are between
-1.0 and +1.0, there is one arrow with value of +9.0. This causes the
large arrow to be clearly visible while other arrows are extremely small
 that are very hard to be seen. I think Paraview shows the arrows
relative to the largest value(s). Is there any way to force Paraview to
show only absolute values? In that case, however very large arrows might
exist in my sample, but other arrows are at least in medium size and
therefore visible.

Thanks for your help,

D.

I suspect that you  have to add libmpi_cxx.so to MPI_EXTRA_LIBRARY.
The full path should be something like
/usr/global/openmpi/1.3.3/gnu/lib/libmpi_cxx.so

Yes, they use the same code. At the end, freetype is doing the
rendering of text so it may be possible to write a pure OpenGL program
that reproduces the effort but it would probably be not easy.

There is a scaling factor for the glyph that you can edit. You have to
first click on the Edit button and type in the value you want to
scale.

Message-ID: <4314f7000912211426t51efb39n8129db5473618b17@mail.gmail.com>

I recently updated my ParaView3 source directory in preparation for a
clean build of the OverView informatics client. The last time I had
updated from CVS was in early September. The OverView build
instructions (http://kitware.com/InfovisWiki/index.php/Building_OverView)
haven't changed, but the OverView target appears to have been removed
from the CMake config files: there is no "PARAVIEW_BUILD_OverView"
option.

Is it still possible to build OverView?

Not currently. There are plans to roll OverView capabilities into
ParaView proper, but it's still too early to comment when that would
happen.

How do you get a function to display on the Object inspector using python
shell.


The point data has a scalar variable called "H_field"

i use the following command in the python shell.

__________________________________________

Calculator1=Calculator()
Calculator1.AttributeMode='point_data'
Calculator1.Function='H_field*2'

Nothing is displayed in the object inspector..

Luis,

With the 3.6.2 release candidate and the latest CVS you can use the Python tracing to build a Python script that does the operation you wish.  You can then edit the script if necessary and make a macro for it.

One of the intentions of the Python tracing/macro capability is to make creating solutions to these repetitive processes easy.  If you try this, let us know how it works for you.

Subject: [Paraview] duplicate points
Message-ID: <4B33FE1F.5030007@bredband.net>


I have a question about how Paraview parses the VTK files. I use
VERTICES to show points on a geometry which works fine and they are shown
on our shape when Paraview is used. But, some points are duplicated
which means some points are overlapping each other. I want to know if
Parview
is smart enough to simply ignore duplicated points, defined using POINTS
or it will make the 3D geometry heavier and as programmer I need to take
care
of that and make sure that there are no duplicate points?

Thanks,

D.

Hi everyone,

When I connect the paraview client to the server, the  render windows
are shown fullscreen on the  cluster nodes. But if I try to draw something,
the render windows on visualization nodes are not shown fullscreen any more.
I set the resolution of all the monitors to the same(1024x768 @60Hz).How to
fix this problem?

Thanks.

Are you using tile-display mode? what version of PV are you using? there was a bug in tiled display mode, which was fixed about a month ago. Try version 3.6.2 or the CVS trunk if you can.

Inside the ParaView.app bundle, in with all the paraview and vtk  
libraries does "libvtkPVServerManager.dylib" exist? This is a typical  
OS X situation where you may have to adjust the "install_name" with  
"install_name_tool" in order to allow all the libraries to load. A  
"not recommended" hack is to also add to the DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH as  
appropriate, but that is just really considered more of a work around  
and VERY prone to failure.

Giovanni,

Here is the XML comment format

<!--  Comment to the lucky person skilled with emacs  -->

I attached a *.pvd file that references *.vtu files with similar comments.

ParaView by default will not remove duplicate points. However, there
are filters that can do this. For example, you can use "clean to grid"
to remove duplicate points of unstructured meshes. I believe that
there is a clean polydata filter that does the same for polygonal
datasets.

However, I would prefer the plots at cell centers, is that supposed to 
work ? If not, why not :-) ? If so, it doesn't appear to, could I add 
that to a bug-list somewhere ? TIA, & I have plots of all of this, but 
they caused my posts to be bounced as too big, let me know if you want 
them ....

Subject: [Paraview] cannot get streamlines on unstructured meshes
Message-ID: <4B3AAA5E.7090004@ices.utexas.edu>

Hi,

        While all paraview features work perfectly fine for my
unstructured mesh output, I cannot get streamlines to show up (or they
are too small to see). This only happens on warped geometries -- if the
geometry is a Cartesian box, everything works.
I've tried the CleanToGrid feature to align nodes and avoid holes due to
roundoff in the mesh, but not had any success.
It must be some simple problem, for instance caused by not perfectly
aligned elements, but I do not see the problem. I'd highly appreciate
any hint.

Here is a small test example where I have the problem (I use v3.4 but
have tried other versions as well)
http://users.ices.utexas.edu/~georgst/files/chunk_velocity.vtu


Thanks everybody,

georg

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView 3.6.2 release imminent
Message-ID: <a44d4ae00912301441o662fae92rb104d73758293f0e@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

The ParaView 3.6.2 release is now imminent! At this time I would like to
provide the latest set of binaries (Release Candidate 3) to anyone
interested in trying them out whilst I tag the repository and generate the
final binaries.

Win32: http://www.paraview.org/files/v3.6/paraview-3.6.2-rc3-win32-x86.exe
Win64: http://www.paraview.org/files/v3.6/paraview-3.6.2-rc3-win64-x86.exe
Linux32:
http://www.paraview.org/files/v3.6/paraview-3.6.2-rc3-Linux32-x86.tar.gz
Linux64:
http://www.paraview.org/files/v3.6/paraview-3.6.2-rc3-Linux64-x86.tar.gz
Mac App:
http://www.paraview.org/files/v3.6/paraview.app-3.6.2-rc3-Darwin-universal.dmg
Mac Command Line:
http://www.paraview.org/files/v3.6/paraview.cl-3.6.2-rc3-Darwin-universal.tar.gz

Two significant new features to 3.6.2 are that the Mac application bundle
and comand line tools are now built as universal binaries (PPC and Intel
i386). This simplifies our build process by reducing the number of packages
we maintain.

The second difference is the inclusion of the VisTrails plugin in the
Windows and Linux packages. VisTrails is an open-source scientific workflow
and provenance management system developed at the University of Utah that
provides support for data exploration and visualization. Whereas workflows
have been traditionally used to automate repetitive tasks, for applications
that are exploratory in nature, such as simulations, data analysis and
visualization, very little is repeated---change is the norm. See
http://www.vistrails.org/index.php/Main_Page to learn more.

The Release notes that appeared in the October Kitware Source describe
further new features:

ParaView's Python interface was revamped, an exciting new extension to the
Paraview Python interface is Python trace. The goal of trace is to generate
human readable, not overly verbose, Python scripts that mimic a user's
actions in the GUI. See the "Python Trace" article on page 6 of the October
2009 Kitware Source for more details.

ParaView 3.6.2 also include a collection of statistics algorithms.
You can compute descriptive statistics (mean, variance, min, max, skewness,
kurtosis), compute contingency tables, perform k-means analysis, examine
correlations between arrays, and perform principal component analysis on
arrays.  More information about these filters is available on the ParaView
Wiki at http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Statistical_analysis.

Please feel free to notify me of any issues experienced with these binaries.

Happy Holidays!

Subject: [Paraview]  How to see 3D Surface
Message-ID: <4B3BDD0F.30506@gmail.com>

Hi, 

I am trying to generate a 3D dataset from a 2D dataset with field 
values.  I read the thread in the subject line, and tried the suggestion 
but couldn't get it to work.  The suggestion was to use the calculator 
to do the following:

coords + vitesse_X*kHat


I tried doing things like:

coords + (my_field_value)*coordsZ

that didn't work, and I can't figure out what "vitesse" is, can you 
enlighten me?  Thanks!

Ryan

What do you mean by field values? Are you trying to make a "terrain
map" - i.e. a surface that is z = f(x,y)? If so, you can use the
Delaunay 2D filter.

Sorry if this is way off - I didn't see the beginning of the conversation.

Thanks,

David

vitesse is french for speed, so he was probably telling you to generate 
the new coordinates as:

coords + speed_X * kHat .... although I think it might better read:

coords + delta * kHat, for i = 1 to N repetitions, but who knows ....

Hi David,

Thanks for the response.  Yes, I am trying to make a terrain map, and 
yes I have tried the Delauney filters.  I have a 2D unstructured mesh, 
with several fields defined at the grid points.  When I view the data I 
get a 2D contour map, but what I want is a non-colored 3D representation 
of f(x,y), with grid lines, where f is the height above my 2D x-y 
plane.  Does that make sense?

Someone else just responded saying that vitesse means "speed" in french, 
but I'm still unsure what the command is supposed to do.

Ryan

Can you share the data (or a small subset - maybe a 10x10-ish grid
with 1 field of value (the z coordinate) )? I can poke around with it
tomorrow. I'd probably write a little VTK program to simply convert
the field data into the actual z component of each point's coordinate
- maybe someone can tell you how to do this inside Paraview?

Thanks,

David

Subject: [Paraview] XDMF with H5T_COMPOUND
Message-ID: <4B3D0B2B.5090201@renci.org>

Hi All,

Newbie here.
 Is there an example on how to create an XDMF node of compound datatype? 
I have a HDF5 dataset where a leaf node in the HDF5 tree is an array of 
compounded data structure, i.e.

particle id (int) / x / y / z / pressure x (double) / pressure y / 
pressure z / mass / energy / name (string)
...
particle id (int) / x / y / z / pressure x (double) / pressure y / 
pressure z / mass / energy / name (string)

There is no internal connection between particles.

I am following the Write XDMF example in
http://www.xdmf.org/index.php/Write_Xdmf
which illustrate a 3D grid data topology. Would you please help? Thanks 
a lot.

Best,
xunlei
