Subject: [Paraview] cluster server-client connection
Message-ID: <44562AFA.90806@psu.edu>

Hi,

I compiled ParaView on a 64-bit linux cluster with MPI support and would 
like to connect using a client on a 32-bit linux display w/o MPI.

I got the following error when attemping this;

Process id: 0 >> ERROR: In 
/usr/global/paraview-cvs20060427/src/ParaView-cvs20060427/Servers/Common/vtkClientConnection.cxx, 
line 334 vtkClientConnection (0x3604e80): Failed to get correct ID to 
assign to this connection.
 
Connected to client
Client connection closed.


Do the ParaView version numbers 2.5/2.4 and 32/64 bit architectures need 
to match?

Versions need to match. In the configuration, VTK_USE_64BIT_IDS have to
match. 64/32 bit should work as long as these match.

Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.64.0605011518460.218@ncmir>


hi,

i am wondering if paraview supports mullion 
information when rendering to a tiled display. 
in case that is not a known term (mullion... 
since it was not known to me until today), this 
refers to the hiding of image information at the 
borders of the lcd screens, such that the data 
appears continuous across the junction of 
adjacent displays.  in case this is still not 
clear, please let me know and i can provide a 
concrete example.

thanks,

Hi everybody,

I am using paraview to plot the results of a f.e. program. I need to
look at the deformation of multi-block structures. I am using xml
files to make an animation (a collection of .vtu files).
Right now I am debugging the f.e. program and I need to recognize the
different cells forming the structure. How should I assign a number
(in the screen output) at each different cell of the structure? Here
are an example of the .pvd file and the .vtu. How should I improve the
resolution of the screen output?

Thanks

Write a separate file with only e.g. the coordinates of the cell 
centres. Then use 'label point ID' to display the number of the point. 
(numbering starts at 0)

Bit clumsy since these labels are not hidden by any geometry in front so 
gets very messy for 3D models.

Hi, is there a filter in paraview which calculates the center of a surface?
Something like: given a cylindrical surface, find is axis?

Thanks

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView on Intel Mac
Message-ID: <4458FBBE.40306@mcs.anl.gov>


I've built paraview 2.4.3 on my MacBook, and want it to recognize the 
three custom readers I've written and the vtkGaussianSplatter filter 
I've added.  (BTW, I was only able to do this by setting 
BUILD_SHARED_LIBS to OFF.)

I've written the XML files for the user interfaces (and the server 
manager as well), and set PV_INTERFACE_PATH to point to the directory on 
the Mac where they reside (and have set things up likewise on the server 
cluster).

However, when I run "paraview" as a single process under X11 on the Mac, 
it will only add entries in the filter and file dialog menus for the 
splatting filter and readers (the readers aren't on the Mac, but this 
was a test) if I use the "Import Package" submenu of the "File" menu.

And, "pvclient" can't find them via PV_INTERFACE_PATH or "Import 
Package" -- or finds them but doesn't use them -- when I run in 
client-sever mode.

(These XML files, readers and filter all worked when I ran the paraview 
client (in this case, 2.4.2) on my Thinkpad under XP -- and when I ran 
"paraview.exe" as a single process there.)

FYI:  I left the OpenGL and GLU CMake parameters in their default 
settings, pointing to the frameworks, rather than pointing them at the 
/usr/X11 directories, where it looks as though there are other headers 
and lib's.

AND:  weird:  when paraview fails to find/use the XML files, the file 
dialog menu fills my 1400x900-pixel screen, and beyond (about 14 file 
types are off-screen and inaccessible), but when the XML files are used, 
this problem seems not to arise.


Any ideas?


Thanks.

So you are saying that you can actually BUILD and RUN paraview  
successfully on a MacBook? What sources are you using? CVS or  
release? How are you building it?
   I have been completely unsuccessful are running Paraview on my  
MacBook Pro. I can build it, but it bombs part way through startup. I  
thought I tried building with static libs, but I will try again.

   I have no idea on the rest of your questions, sorry. Maybe Andy

I solved my main problem (but the annoyance lingers).

Re the problem:  the splatting filter and my three readers now appear in 
the appropriate menus as they should.  (I...uh...wasn't exporting 
PV_INTERFACE_PATH.  Don't laugh, please.  I've been working for a couple 
years with systems that either didn't require that or didn't make it 
explicit, and simply overlooked it.)

Re the annoyance:  well, "appear in the appropriate menus" might be too 
strong a description of the availability of my readers in the file 
dialog, since their entries are still beyond the bottom of my screen on 
the yet-1400x900-pixel-without-small-enough-text-to-show-ever-entry 
menu.   But, I can work with it for a time.

Mike,

Yes, I've built it and run it on the MacBook.

I've built stable releases 2.4.2 and 2.4.3.  (Release 2.4.2 was getting 
the following run-time error, and 2.4.3 was not:

    In <paraview_src>/VTK/Rendering/vtkXOpenGLRenderWindow.cxx, line 347
    vtkXOpenGLRenderWindow (0x1ebc69b0): Could not find a decent visual)

The first time I ran 2.4.3, I got a seg. fault creating a cut plane for 
a 3d, hierarchical fractal I'd created from the "Source" menu, but I 
haven't seen it since.  (I've run it on the order of 10 times, both as a 
single process on the mac, and as a client in both serial and parallel 
client-server runs.)

See http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/~hudson/ParaView/paraview.html for 
screen shots of the 3 pages of CMake parameters.

Hi,

I have some questions about the use of materials and mappers in paraview : 

1 / suppose I have my own material, which use a variable. Take for 
instance the GLSLTwisted material which have a "Rate" variable. How can I 
access/modifiy this variable? 
Can I write some XML file like the ones for user-written filter and 
associate a "vtkSMProperty" to the variable in a server-side xml file, and 
an client-side xml where I describe my interface?
2 / I have written a specific mapper. How can I have acces to this mapper 
in paraview? How could I modify the interface to set specifics of this 
mapper?

Thanks,
Stephane

Hi,

I would like to have two or more windows to have multiple views of my 
data. 
Is it possible to create another window or another renderer?
In the vtkKWWindow documentation, it seems that multiple views can be 
used, but how can I activate it?
If yes, 
        how could I choose which actor is visible in which 
window/renderer? Is there a notion of "active window"
        how could I resize/change the the positions of the different 
windows?


Thanks
Stephane

I have described it here:
http://www.geophysik.uni-muenchen.de/~moder/Paraview/Paraview_on_the_Geowall.php

Maybe the stereo mode can also be changed with Tcl commands, but I don't
know how.

Message-ID: <445B65C4.6030102@psu.edu>

I found it was very easy to switch to from the default red/blue stereo 
to active stereo.
In  vtkRenderWindow.cxx change 
 //  this->StereoType = VTK_STEREO_RED_BLUE;
  this->StereoType = VTK_STEREO_CRYSTAL_EYES;
and recompile.

Does anyone have a link to supported file formats that load into ParaView?

Hi
I tried to output my data from Paraview 2.4.2 using legacy VTK file. But I
found it's a binary VTK file. I need a ASCII VTK for my application. Any
option I can use???


Thanks!

Hi all,

Has anyone found a way to accurately measure distances without measuring
between endpoints? When i attempt to click on my structure it seldomly
regesters, rather giving me a point in space. Thanks

[apologies if this was posted twice]

hi,

i am (a major newbie) running paraview in 
parallel mode with mpich2 (1.0.3) on a 2 
dual-core cpu machine using this:

mpiexec -n 4 /usr/local/paraview2.5/bin/paraview/

and many things seem slower than just running 
paraview in single cpu mode.  one of the trivial 
things that is noticably MUCH slower is simply 
loading a file: i have a 500MB file that takes 
about 5 seconds to load in single cpu mode, and 
takes about 30-40 seconds when running in MPI.  
also, no matter if i run in single or MPI, the 
slowest process that i have seen so far 
(PainterPolyDataMapper) only uses a single cpu.  
i am sure there is just something i am doing 
wrong.  any hints on how (if!?) i can change 
this behaviour?  i have ordered the book but it 
has not yet arrived...

thanks,
bryan

What kind of file are you loading? What and how are you rendering? Certain
things will get slower when running with MPI because running in parallel
adds the overhead of interprocess communication. Creating and rendering (in
parallel) a small cone for example will be slower. ParaView tries to
optimize parameters for parallel execution but sometimes the user has to set
certain parameters appropriately.

Does anyone know of an efficient way to measure exact point distances. The
distance filter does not identify or recognize points like the Pick filter
can, although this filter does not help with distance measurement.

Bryan,
Slower or faster is decided by the data type. Only
regular types of data (structured grid or image data)
can be divided into sub-grids automatically by paraview
when running in parallel mode.
For unstructured data (poly data or unstructured grid)
the distribution should be done by users. Or, you can use
D3 filter on your data, which can redistribute your data
on the parallel system evenly.

Our lab aslo is testing the parallel performance of paraview,
could you tell me what is format of your data? and is it could
be shared with us?

Could you describe how to use the D3 filter? I guess you use a Tcl 
script, but I don't know how to do that.

There's a test in there that got me started ... sort of.

Let's try to debug this:

1. You said if you open the same file and isosurface on 1 processor, it is
faster, right?
2. Please verify that you are rendering locally by checking off the
Composite flag in 3D View Properties.
3. When you load the image and you only see the wireframe outline, does it
render slow?
4. Open the timer log from Window -> Timer Log, push Clear on the upper
left, cause a render (rotate a bit), hit Refresh. What do you see on the
timer log?

Hi,

I am  running "pvserver  -rc  -ch=x.x.x.x" with "pvclient -rc 
sh=x.x.x.x"  and depending upon the machine running the client
I get the msg "unable to open display" on the toolbar icon for the 
splashscreen.  The splashscreen pops up so the connection is
working but the display of the paraview app fails. Does anyone have any 
ideas/experience with this problem?

It is slower because the legacy reader is not capable of reading a piece of
the data. So what happens is that each process is reading the whole file and
throwing away  that part that is not needed. So you  are hitting the same
disk with 4 simultaneous reads of the same file. Try this. After opening the
file, save it as a pvti file. Load this file. Is it faster? Even this might
be slower than reading with 1 processor since you are reading from the same
disk and causing contention.

This is also expected. You are rendering locally, meaning you are rendering
everything on the first node. This should be as slow (or as fast) as running
on 1 node. If you want to make use of parallel rendering, you have to enable
compositing. Of course, you have to running paraview on a real cluster with
graphics cards for this to work.

This is the intended behavior. Rendering using display lists without
triangle strips is potentially dangerous because the graphics card might run
out of memory.

That's what I meant, the box.

No, no need use Tcl script, just load the data (e.g. blow.vtk), and choose
the D3 from Filter menu. If you set the Composite option to zero in 3D View Properties,
you will find that before D3 the every process renders the whole blow, but after
D3 every process only render 1/4 blow.

Subject: [Paraview] TCLLIBPATH
Message-ID: <1147271901.16857.41.camel@gargon.hooperlab>

It seems ParaView from today's CVS does not respect TCLLIBPATH again.

export TCLLIBPATH=/home/kevin/kitware/ParaView_Build/lib/tcl8.4/
[kevin@gargon ParaView_Build]$ paraview
ParaView error: InitializeTcl failed
Tcl_Init error: Can't find a usable init.tcl in the following
directories:
    /usr/local/lib/tcl8.4 /home/kevin/kitware/lib/tcl8.4 /home/kevin/lib/tcl8.4 /home/kevin/kitware/library /home/kevin/library /home/kevin/tcl8.4.5/library /home/tcl8.4.5/library /usr/local/lib/tcl8.4



This probably means that Tcl wasn't installed properly.


The full path to paraview in the builddir works though. There is a bug
on this, #2750. The OP says he was told it was fixed in CVS. My last
build from CVS was quite a while ago, weeks maybe months, and it
respected TCLLIBPATH.

hi,

has anyone been able to successfully build

have tried unsuccessfully a few times, and am 
now wondering if there is anything in particular 
i should be doing differently.  here is my

-DMPI_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=/local2/openmpi1.0.2/lib/libmpi.so 
/local2/paraview-2.4.3/ 


any hints/tips/tricks for getting this to work?  
if interested, i can provide more details 
regarding the sorts of errors i was getting.

thanks,

Hi Nancy,

This is not the same as mullions, and i am, unfortunately, not qualified to help you solve this problem.  What I can tell you, though, is that you needn't worry about mullions with a projector display because there are no "frames" around the edges of the tiles in your display.  I would suggest posting your question to the entire ParaView users group and see if anyone can help you out. 

best of luck,
bryan

Hi,

Our lab is building a display wall (1x3, three projector and a very large screen), that is to say one image is divided into three parts and projected onto the large screen through the three projectors.
But the engineer from display wall company teld us there needs redundant information between every two adjacent parts of the image to smooth the boundaries of the image parts.
Paraview supports tiled display, and can create 1x3 displays, but I don't know how to control it to create the redundant information between the displays. A simple illustration of my requirement is

I am not sure whether here "redundant information" has the same meanning with the "mullion information" you point to?

Hi,

Can you explain the meanning of mullion information
in detail?

this is rather difficult to explain, and since paraview does not support it, i am not sure how much this will be worth, but here goes... 

here is a definintion for mullion: a framing element which divides adjacent window, door , or glass units. (wikipedia)

in tiled displays made of a set of LCD monitors, it is desireable to render images such that there appears to be image information 'behind' the plastic borders of each LCD monitor.  if you do not do this, and instead render the image such that all pixels are visible, it will look all disjointed at the boundaries of the displays.  a simple illustration of this may be seen in this little image i made: 

http://ncmir.ucsd.edu/~bryan/mullions.jpg 

this picture is intended to show a simple two-monitor tiled display with a diagonal line that spans across the displays.  on top, the mullions have been taken into account, so the line appears as it should... continuous across the display.  on the bottom, all the pixels of the line are now visible, but now the line looks disjoint.  does that help? 



Dose that mean overlap region of two images that are
projected onto two adjacent displays?

Subject: [Paraview] 2.4 CVS / vtkOpenGLPainterDeviceAdapter error
Message-ID: <1147363668.6660.18.camel@icarus.flyg.kth.se>

Hi,

I've been experiencing annoying problems using the latest (yesterday)
CVS 2.4 Paraview sources compiled on an AMD64-machine. Paraview behaves
well until I try to _visualize_ the result of a cut through a
vtkCellDerivatives derived dataset. I am using non-MPI Paraview locally.
(as the MPI binaries exit with a segfault 11 when doing this) 

Pipeline:

     1. Load Ensight gold dataset (vtkGenericEnsightReader)
     2. compute derivatives (vtkCellCenters)
     3. convert cell data to point data (vtkPCellDataToPointData)
     4. cut with plane (vtkCutter)

... so far everything's fine ...

after changing into the "Display" tab to visualize the vorticity cut
dataset, I get a bunch of these errors:

[...]
ErrorMessage
# Error or warning: There was a VTK Error in
file: /usr/local/src/ParaView/VTK/Rendering/vtkOpenGLPainterDeviceAdapter.cxx (436)
 vtkOpenGLPainterDeviceAdapter (0x4568100): Unsupported attribute index:
4
ErrorMessage end
[...]


Through trial and error I discovered that the settings "Use Immediate
Mode Rendering" and "Use Triangle Strips" have an effect on the _amount_
of error messages :-)

Does anybody have an idea what the problem is? Concerning the
compilation, I didn't change any ccmake default compilation flags ...
maybe that's the problem?

Hi all,

I wish to use the Probe filter to sample attribute values of my point cloud
along a line. The resulting XY plot always only returns one value, as i
assume it is not hitting any other points (perhaps due to 5 point accuracy
in my point set). I am wondering if there is an option available to either
a) increase my line width or error region to enable selection of closely
neighbouring points, or
b) generate spheres from each point in the point cloud so that a line/sphere
intersection registers on the plot

I would appreciate any ideas, thanks

Subject: [Paraview] vtkDataArray::SetComponent()
Message-ID: <44636DF7.1040905@mcs.anl.gov>


For a long time, we've used vtkDataArray::SetComponent() to build an 
array of scalar (1-component) attributes to add to vtkUnstructuredGrid.

While I was looking the other way, so to speak, making my paraview 
particle reader work, and as a couple new versions of paraview were 
released, something changed so that, when I now use my other, 
vtkUnstructuredGrid-building reader, the loop that loads the attributes 
(with 2048 calls to SetComponent()) takes more than half a minute (as 
measured by clock()), which is glacially slow.  I haven't found any 
change I might've made that would explain this.

If I replace SetComponent() with SetValue() or SetTuple1, I get my speed 
back, but now isosurfaces are messed up as though there's no continuity 
bewteen cells.


Is there any reason I should be seeing these symptoms?


Thanks.

Randy.

I've added vtkGaussianSplatter to the filter menu.  Passing your point 
cloud through that will spread the points' influence into the 
neighboring space, which will then be sampled by a regular grid of a 
resolution of your choosing.  You can also adjust the size of the 
Gaussian kernel.

I haven't tried probing the grid, though.

I need to add some help with the kernel radius widget of the splat filter:

The number you enter into the "Kernel Radius" widget needs, I believe, 
to be <= 1.0, and is the ratio of the kernel's size to that of the data 
domain.  I believe the "size" of the data domain is the length of its 
longest side...maybe.  I'd need to re-read the doc on the splatting 
filter.  I set the default to 1/10 the size of the domain.

I set the default sampling grid to 20 samples on a side, which would 
force about 2 samples per splat.  If you want smoother results, make 
that at least 4 samples per splat.

Randy,
I have loaded the filter and it appears on the filter menu but it is
unhighlighted for every type of data set i try to apply it to. It only takes
a point cloud as an input, correct? As it stands i cannot make it available
to any sata set or type. Does this sound familiar?

My point cloud is vtkPolyData and the filter works with that.

Shawn,

Sorry, I didn't answer your questions.

The only point cloud I know it accepts as input is one defined as 
vtkPolyData.
(1  Can one be defined another way in vtk?
 2  If so, I've never tried it.)

With some data types, the splat filter is not ghosted out.  An example:  
the sample data, "iron protein.vtk", that comes w/ paraview.

But, I've only been concerned with using on my vtkPolyData point clouds.

No problem.  (BTW, I'm using paraview 2.4.3.)

I use the VTK that comes w/ paraview.  vtkGaussianSplatter is part of 
VTK.  (The paraview guide has a short section on adding VTK filters to 
the paraview menu.)

I have tried all the files you have mentioned, still nothing. Is the VTK
file for this filter in the standard VTK distribution, or did you create it
- as im assuming the file that performs the computations must exist
somewhere?
This might be why the filter wont regester for any of my data files.

Thank you for your help and patience

Hi all,

I've been trying to run Paraview 2.4.3 compiled with MPI in a SGI Altix
system but after lauching the pvdataserver I got the following error
message:

[rnelias@saturn bin]$ mpirun -np 4 pvdataserver -rc -ch=xxx.yyy.zzz.www

The pvclient was left waiting in reverse connection mode (pvclient -rc) in
the Windows XP system as I'm used doing with PV 2.2.1 (which works fine for
the same configuration). So, what could be happening?!

Well, the errors would be useful :-).  However, I expect you really want 
something like:

-DMPI_LIBRARY::STRING="-L/local2/openmpi1.0.2/lib -lmpi_cxx -lmpi -lorte 
-lopal"

Let me know if that works.

Im on v2.4, once ive Dl'd the VTK source code should i need to configure any
settings for the gaussiansplatter.xml to look for/recognize the
vtkGaussianSplatter file?
I have added my PV_INTERFACE_PATH variable, but thats simply to look for the
xml file.
Maybe the xml cannot find the vtk source needed....?
Thanks

First do you have an X server on your client? A data server shouldn't be
opening any windows ( Should it? ) so I don't think you need an X
server.

Is this the first time you are running paraview on the cluster or do you
think something broke in 2.4.3?

Be sure these are the right mpicc and mpicxx versions and not another 
MPI's.  I suspect the .la line is roughly equivalent to what I sent.

Hmmm, looks like it doesn't think that your paraview is really an MPI 
program.  OpenMPI's orterun/mpirun/mpiexec (all the same) can launch 
non-MPI programs on multiple nodes as well.

However, I've never actually compiled paraview with openmpi (yet), so I 
don't have any real experience.  I'll have to try it sometime though.

these are the only  mpicc and mpicxxs on the path:

{iridium_51} which mpicxx
/local2/openmpi1.0.2/bin/mpicxx
{iridium_52} which mpicc
/local2/openmpi1.0.2/bin/mpicc

indeed... even with your version of the LIBRARY path, when i

mpiexec -n 4 paraview

it opens 4 paraview windows, not just one window with parallel support.  too
bad.  guess i will be using mpich for now.

it would be interesting to see if you notice the same behaviour.

Answering Kevin

no, I don't have X server on my client since (I guess) it isn't necessary
when running PV on client x server mode. I only started pvclient on the
Windows XP system (pvclient -rc) and left it waiting the pvdataserver
connection from the SGI Altix system (mpirun -np 4 pvdataserver -rc
-ch=[pvclient's IP]). I was not expecting any screen from my dataserver
since it doens't make sense for me. I was expecting the pvdataserver
connection and the screen started on the client side with the binary
available locally (on the client's side) but it doesn't happen. The
pvdataserver suddenly broke with the message I wrote in the previous mail.

Answering Berk

I could say that it's my first time trying to run PV version 2.4.3 in this
system... I'm used to running the previous stable release (2.2.1) on the
same system combination ("Wintel"+SGI Altix) without any problem. I couldn't
say if this problem is due the version 2.4.3 or my compilation. I only can
say that the compilation ran fine and the binary was built with CMAKE 2.0.3,
GCC 3.2.3-47, and MPI from the SGI propack. 

Is there anything different between the client x server mode from version
2.2.1 to 2.4.3? 

(I only observed the screen on the client machine with the message "waiting
server connection")

Regards

Renato.

The -DMPI_INCLUDE_PATH and -DMPI_LIBRARY should be unnecessary when 
using mpicc and mpicxx.

Hello, 
   
  I try to investigate how much performance improvement can be gained using parallel mpi version of Paraview. However all the sample data sets coming with Paraview source code looks like not large enough. 
   
  Where can i get a big data set? or How can i efficently use exsiting data set in Paraview to verify mpi performance gain? (That means what filter operation will cost more resource usage? I am newbie to Visualization, forgive me about this entry-level question)
   
  Thanks a lot for suggestions!

I am not getting any errors upon running paraview, the only problem being
that the filter is not available.

When running CMake should i have to change any of the variables to find my
VTK folder?
The adding a filter tutorial does not mention anything regarding the actual
location of the vtkFilterName file (rather only where the .pvsm and .xml
files should be placed)

Thanks

Subject: [Paraview] N Render Server nodes and M Data Server nodes
Message-ID: <BAY109-F38A2E34DB14AD35103905DC2A30@phx.gbl>

Hello,

The context is: using ParaView in Parallel, having N Render Server nodes and 
M Data Server nodes, with N<M.
I have read the ParaView Guide (v 2.4) but it is not clear in my mind 
whether the remaining M-N Data Server nodes are contributing in the data 
transfer between the Data Server and the Render Server (sending data to the 
connected Data Server nodes on an as demand basis), OR the remaining M-N 
Data Server nodes are remaining idle (after they sent all their data to the 
connected Data Server nodes).

See ParaView Guide (v 2.4), figure 95 (page 117).

Can you enlighten me ?

Kind regards,
Christophe.

I didn't knowingly set any CMake parameters whose purpose is to make the 
filter findable.

If you haven't done so, try setting your parameters to match (except for 
my peculiar directories) those in the CMakeCache.txt file I included in 
one of my recent emails.  Otherwise, I'm out of ideas.

Randy.

On many systems rsh is a link to ssh.

Remote connections to the X server are often disabled (startx --nolisten 
tcp). But ssh can be told to forward all X connections; write in your 
~/.ssh/config:
HOST *
   ForwardX11 yes

I guess, you've been facing the same problem with X servers and
client/server connections than me...

Take a look:
http://public.kitware.com/pipermail/paraview/2006-May/003032.html

I'm a bit confused about how PV 2.4.3 deal with client/server connections.
In PV 2.2.1 it was not necessary X11 forward to have PV working in CS
connections. The error message I've reported only appears when I try to do
the same procedure with PV 2.4.3 that I do with PV 2.2.1. I thought that the
pvdataserver didn't have nothing to do with the pvclient's GUI on the client
side. For me, the dataserver was only in charge to load data and dispatch to
the client through the network connection. Am I wrong?! Is it a bug, a
change or we're doing the wrong thing?

Thanks in advance

I also thought that the pvdataserver has nothing to do with the graphics 
output; I was astonished that pvdataserver fails to run on our cluster 
because there is no OpenGL library installed. Bug or "feature"?

Hi Christoph,

So when paraview running in parallel tries to open a process on other 
nodes it uses X forwarding? The X forwarding from my
cluster server to laptop client works fine if I dont run in parallel 
(i.e. mpirun) so X forwarding is working untill I use mpirun.

Should I be compiling paraview with offscreen rendering to avoid X 
forwarding among cluster nodes?

All,

I haven't followed the entire thread, but just wanted to mention that in
general 'forwarding X' when running ParaView client/server is a very bad
idea (performance 20x slower and bypassing all the image delivery work
in ParaView).

When running in client/server folks should do one of the following two
things:
1) Set up their server nodes so that they can open X windows (Sandia has
done this on like 10 different clusters, it's not that hard, if you need
instructions please email me).
2) Compile the server with Mesa (note: the client should never be
compiled with Mesa)

What do you mean by "input for a stream"? The input to the filter?

Hi all, when completing my paraview in INSTALL.dsw, at the last stage of
compiling i get an error regarding the paraview.exe file:

.

Does anyone know what step to trace back to figure out where to find this

No. This is planned (and is being worked on) for a future version of
paraview. Most probably after 2.6.

Hi Jack,

Yes, I think so.

You mean: if you connect from a pvclient on your laptop to a pvserver on 
the cluster, then it works?
That would make sense because then the connection is initiated by the 
client, not the remote server. I think, the other way round does not work.

> Should I be compiling paraview with offscreen rendering to avoid X

No. On our system paraview runs with mpirun without offscreen rendering.

(I even could not compile paraview with the mangled Mesa library. Don't 
know why.)

Sorry, but I'm still in doubt...

Maybe my doubt is due the way I'm running the client/server mode. I should
emphasize that I'm running in a client/DATA server mode using a SGI Altix
which doesn't have any rendering capability. Thus, here goes my questions...

BRIAN: 1) Set up their server nodes so that they can open X windows (Sandia
has done this on like 10 different clusters, it's not that hard, if you need
instructions please email me).

RENATO: Why? If I'm running in a client/data server scheme my data server
only need to load and dispatch my data to the client which should launch the
PV GUI. I can't see why is it necessary to open X windows in this case.


BRIAN: 2) Compile the server with Mesa (note: the client should never be
compiled with Mesa)

RENATO: The question remains. Is it really necessary to compile PV with Mesa
support in a system without rendering capability?
 
Thanks a lot for your feedback Brian

All,

I haven't followed the entire thread, but just wanted to mention that in
general 'forwarding X' when running ParaView client/server is a very bad
idea (performance 20x slower and bypassing all the image delivery work in
ParaView).

When running in client/server folks should do one of the following two
things:
1) Set up their server nodes so that they can open X windows (Sandia has
done this on like 10 different clusters, it's not that hard, if you need
instructions please email me).
2) Compile the server with Mesa (note: the client should never be compiled
with Mesa)

If I understood your question you can easily do it with the "extract
surface" and "clip" filters. First extract the external boundary from your
model with the "extract surface" filter, then use the "clip" filter to cut
out what you don't want to see.

Well, mostly because this may not scale well. Polygonal data generated by 10
nodes might be too big to be handled by a single node. If you client can
handle it, no problem. There is not client/data server scheme. You either
have client/data server/render server or client/server modes. If you are
running in client/server modes, the server is capable of both processing and
rendering. If you don't want the server to render, disable compositing. At
that point, there is no need for opengl or X display on the server.

It is not necessary. It is optional. If you are not going to render anything
on the server, compile with whatever opengl library you want. Unfortunately,
there is not pure data server in paraview. All servers have to be linked
against some opengl library, even if it is not used.

Renato,

Sandia runs on LOTS of clusters that don't have graphics cards. We NEVER run in data server mode (I personally believe that mode is not useful...ever... (waiting for the flames on that statement... :) )

Anyway you simply compile the server with mesa and the client with opengl. 

Here's an example use case....

Person starts up client/server...
1) the polygonal data generated is less than 10MB so the data gets sent to the client to be rendered. The client has opengl so the rendering is fast. 
2) the polygonal data is more than 10MB so the polygons are rendered on the server and images sent to the client.
2a) User doesn't want that to happen so they turn off compositing and the data is always sent to the client
2b) User is fine with the rendering being done with Mesa, so they do nothing.


The only question that one might ask is why would anyone want 2b) there are plenty of good answers to this one. The easiest one to communicate is the following... I have 400 timesteps, I hit play on the VCR controls, the LAST thing I want is to download 400 x >10MB of geometry to my client just to play the animation.

In fact, many sandia users slide the Compositing threshold to 0MB (yes this is true) when using Mesa. One of the nice things about using Mesa is grabbing the framebuffer is instantaneous so you can actually get about 20 frames/sec image delivery on smaller data.

What is the value of DISPLAY on the cluster frontend? If it's
localhost:whatever, set by ssh, this isn't likely to make sense on the
clients. If the display variable is set by ssh to the real hostname
(internal network is fine) of the cluster front end then the compute
nodes should be able to open windows. This is an sshd option. Can you
run glxgears ( or xclock or whatever ) on the compute nodes?

This made my life MUCH easier. 

I think it's even worse if you don't use offscreen rendering on the
cluster or provide each node with a display ( X virtual frame buffer
works. ). I think the compute nodes are trying to use the graphics
hardware on your laptop... Not sure about that though.

Folks,

Just to reiterate, the servers should ALWAYS open up a window on their
local display, never should the DISPLAY variable on the servers be set
to anything other than localhost:0.

Even if you compile with Mesa (which opens a virtual window) the display
should still be set to localhost:0

Never X forward or openGL forward, if you do you are bypassing an image
delivery system capable of 20-30 frames/sec over 100T interconnect to
the client. (see http://www.nvidia.com/object/IO_27539.html and
http://www.nvidia.com/object/IO_19962.html for some blah blah PR
materials)

Sorry to repeat myself, but it seems like there might be some confusion.

It has been a while since I had the opportunity to flame Brian :-)

That mode is useful if you do not want to move data from one cluster to
another. If you are running on around 10 nodes, there is a huge difference
in rendering performance between software and hardware accelerated OpenGL.
So it makes sense to render on a cluster with hardware support.

 Also, there is a sweet spot when you have, let's say, 128 nodes data server
and 16 nodes hardware accelerated render server where you should get better
performance because Mesa is an order of magnitude slower than hardware
accelerated rendering. To boot, compositing with 128 nodes degrades
performance further. On the other hand, you obviously get a lot of
performance improvement if you process data with 128 nodes as opposed to 16.

Another use case is when you want to render data from a compute server on a
tiled display. The only fast way to do that is to use data server/render
server.

Berk: Well, mostly because this may not scale well. Polygonal data generated

can handle it, no problem
 
Renato: I see what you mean. My problem is that, unfortunately, we don't
have render clusters here. Thus, we must try to work with the Altix as it
was only a parallel data server connected to a Windows XP client machine
performing all rendering work with its NVidia Quadro FX 4400 video card.
 
Berk: there is not pure data server in paraview
 
Renato: Ok. It's clear now. I guess I got confused after seeing what PV
compilation produces. It builds different binaries (pvclient,
pvrenderserver, pvserver and pvdataserver). Firstly I tried to connect the
pvclient (on the Windows machine) with the pvserver (on the Altix system)
but I got that error message (X connection to localhost:10.0 broken
(explicit kill or server shutdown)). After that, I tried to connect pvclient
with pvDATAserver and the problem persisted. I thought it strange since I
was just repeating with PV 2.4.3 the same procedure I used to do with PV
2.2.1 (which has been running nicely in parallel, including with Ensight
files which don't work fine with PV 2.4.3).

Sorry, but I'm still in doubt...

Maybe my doubt is due the way I'm running the client/server mode. I should
emphasize that I'm running in a client/DATA server mode using a SGI Altix
which doesn't have any rendering capability. Thus, here goes my questions...


BRIAN: 1) Set up their server nodes so that they can open X windows (Sandia
has done this on like 10 different clusters, it's not that hard, if you need
instructions please email me).

RENATO: Why? If I'm running in a client/data server scheme my data server 
only need to load and dispatch my data to the client which should launch the
PV GUI. I can't see why is it necessary to open X windows in this case.



Well, mostly because this may not scale well. Polygonal data generated by 10
nodes might be too big to be handled by a single node. If you client can
handle it, no problem. There is not client/data server scheme. You either
have client/data server/render server or client/server modes. If you are
running in client/server modes, the server is capable of both processing and
rendering. If you don't want the server to render, disable compositing. At
that point, there is no need for opengl or X display on the server. 



BRIAN: 2) Compile the server with Mesa (note: the client should never be
compiled with Mesa) 

RENATO: The question remains. Is it really necessary to compile PV with Mesa
support in a system without rendering capability?



It is not necessary. It is optional. If you are not going to render anything
on the server, compile with whatever opengl library you want. Unfortunately,
there is not pure data server in paraview. All servers have to be linked
against some opengl library, even if it is not used.

I think I (you guys) figured it out.  I had used our display wall 
cluster with an Xserver on each node with no problem before.

The new cluster I am using is headless (no Xserver) and I need to 
recompile with use OSMesa option turned on and then use the
offscreen rendering flag and this will take advantage (be faster) than X 
forwarding.  If this is correct someone say YES!?

Sorry, if I contributed to the confusion. I totally agree with the above
statement, and I learned it the hard way. I answered the way I did for
the case where some process on a compute node wants to open a window on
the client's display, perhapse a single pvclient, or a gui, and a dumb
terminal or a user that can't get paraview to compile on his
terminal.( That's me from time to time. )

So you are getting the same error when running pvserver and pvclient? Do me
a favor, make sure that there is no DISPLAY enviromnent variable set when
running in ParaView. You may have to unset it in .XXrc to override what ssh
sets. I want to make sure that the reason the server is crashing is due to X
not due to something else. Another way of finding out is to attach to one of
the pvserver processes with a debugger. Also, does this happen when you run
a 1 node server?

Subject: [Paraview] client/server display problem
Message-ID: <E4C1C0FFED3E6B49AC2C1DA9723BE11E0210E410@ES20SNLNT.srn.sandia.gov>

Okay here's my general response, with more specific responses below.
 
Sandia runs ParaView in client/server probably more than any other
institution in the world. ParaView client/server is run about 500 times
a month on 16 different servers(clusters), by about 40 different users
(not including the vis people).
 
Running ParaView server with Mesa runs absolutely fine! In fact for
small data you can actually see small performance ^increases^ over
OpenGL because grabbing the frame buffer is instantaneous.
 
So my recommendation for everyone is if you don't have graphics cards,
simply compile ParaView server with mesa. Period. Double stamp. No take
backs.
 

	...
	
	That mode is useful if you do not want to move data from one
cluster to another. If you are running on around 10 nodes, there is a
huge difference in rendering performance between software and hardware
accelerated OpenGL. So it makes sense to render on a cluster with
hardware support. 
	
	I agree, I wasn't arguing that you don't want graphics cards, I
was asserting that splitting up the server into data and render is not
useful in my opinion. If you have a cluster that has graphics cards on
it, have that cluster mount the disk where the data is and your done.
	 
	If mounting the disk isn't possible, then you have three options

	1) The first and best option is to run paraview server with
Mesa.
	2) FTP, SCP the data over to the render cluster (I don't like
this option just have it for completeness)
	3) Set up data server on the computation cluster, start up the
render server on the graphics cluster, and set up all the sockets
between the two.
	 
	Here's my problem with option 3. First it's complex, second you
are moving ALL the geometry over the sockets from data server to the
render server. Moving data (even polygonal) is a major no, no. Again
take my use case of 400 timesteps and the user hits 'play'. Even worse,
the sockets connections from the data server to the render server are
most likely a shared 100T hubbed connection.  
	

	 Also, there is a sweet spot when you have, let's say, 128 nodes
data server and 16 nodes hardware accelerated render server where you
should get better performance because Mesa is an order of magnitude
slower than hardware accelerated rendering. To boot, compositing with
128 nodes degrades performance further. On the other hand, you obviously
get a lot of performance improvement if you process data with 128 nodes
as opposed to 16. 
	 
	I bet if you actually ran this test and you compared having the
128 nodes just render their small part of the data locally vs. having
the 128 nodes send their data down to the 16 to have them render it.
That for many, many operations the first would be faster...
	 
	1) I'm cutting, I'm clipping, I'm changing time steps, I'm
animating iso surface values, I'm basically trying to get my job done...
:)
	 
	2) I'm just timing rendering speed because I'm writing a paper
on why data server / render server is a good idea
	 
	ALL the operations in category 1 will be faster with 128 nodes
and mesa.
	I don't care about category 2.
	
	Another use case is when you want to render data from a compute
server on a tiled display. The only fast way to do that is to use data
server/render server. 
	

 
If you have a separate cluster to drive your tiled display and your
can't mount the disk and you can't copy the data and the data is too big
to load on to 16 nodes, then I concede, the data server / render server
would be your option of last resort. :)

problem solved :-)
 
my problem was solved after seeing the last posts. It was exactly due the
DISPLAY enviroment variable which was set (wrongly) to localhost:10.
 
You know, as it was not necessary with PV 2.2.1 I got surprised after
getting that error message in PV 2.4.3
 
Thanks a lot folks
 
obs.: Regarding the data server mode, for me, it is the most useful mode
since I don't work with huge datasets and my client can perform all
rendering work without having to download several pieces of files that were
processed in parallel on the machine without rendering capability. I have a
bunch of files on the processing machine that don't need to be rebuilt on
the client's machine - for me, it's wonderful.

So you are getting the same error when running pvserver and pvclient? Do me
a favor, make sure that there is no DISPLAY enviromnent variable set when
running in ParaView. You may have to unset it in .XXrc to override what ssh
sets. I want to make sure that the reason the server is crashing is due to X
not due to something else. Another way of finding out is to attach to one of
the pvserver processes with a debugger. Also, does this happen when you run
a 1 node server?

Renato: Ok. It's clear now. I guess I got confused after seeing what PV
compilation produces. It builds different binaries (pvclient,
pvrenderserver, pvserver and pvdataserver). Firstly I tried to connect the
pvclient (on the Windows machine) with the pvserver (on the Altix system)
but I got that error message (X connection to localhost:10.0 broken
(explicit kill or server shutdown)). After that, I tried to connect pvclient
with pvDATAserver and the problem persisted. I thought it strange since I
was just repeating with PV 2.4.3 the same procedure I used to do with PV
2.2.1 (which has been running nicely in parallel, including with Ensight
files which don't work fine with PV 2.4.3). 
 
Thanks Berk for the explanations

Sorry, but I'm still in doubt...

Maybe my doubt is due the way I'm running the client/server mode. I should
emphasize that I'm running in a client/DATA server mode using a SGI Altix
which doesn't have any rendering capability. Thus, here goes my questions...


BRIAN: 1) Set up their server nodes so that they can open X windows (Sandia
has done this on like 10 different clusters, it's not that hard, if you need
instructions please email me).

RENATO: Why? If I'm running in a client/data server scheme my data server 
only need to load and dispatch my data to the client which should launch the
PV GUI. I can't see why is it necessary to open X windows in this case.



Well, mostly because this may not scale well. Polygonal data generated by 10
nodes might be too big to be handled by a single node. If you client can
handle it, no problem. There is not client/data server scheme. You either
have client/data server/render server or client/server modes. If you are
running in client/server modes, the server is capable of both processing and
rendering. If you don't want the server to render, disable compositing. At
that point, there is no need for opengl or X display on the server. 



BRIAN: 2) Compile the server with Mesa (note: the client should never be
compiled with Mesa) 

RENATO: The question remains. Is it really necessary to compile PV with Mesa
support in a system without rendering capability?



It is not necessary. It is optional. If you are not going to render anything
on the server, compile with whatever opengl library you want. Unfortunately,
there is not pure data server in paraview. All servers have to be linked
against some opengl library, even if it is not used.

Renato,
 
In your case (1 client) pvserver IS a data server. In fact it the best of both worlds, it's a data server until the polygonal data gets to big (passes the 10MB threshold) and then it becomes a render server, and you can dynamically change that threshold....or if for some bizarre reason you never want it to become a render server (not sure why.. but whatever) you can just turn compositing off and it will always be a data server.
 
In general the point I'm trying to make is that for 99% of the folks out there, splitting the server into a data server and a render server is a more complex, less effective solution, then just running pvserver and pvclient. If you are running pvdataserver and pvrenderserver you should have a REALLY good reason for doing so.
 
Okay have we beat this horse to death yet?  :)

My comptational domain is rectangular. In the fig the yellow rectangular 
surface is one of the external boundaries. I would like to surpress it 
as it makes visualizing streamlines difficult.

yes, I'd like to change the datasource that is used as input for the filter.

Subject: [Paraview] Error in INSTALL while compiling Paraview
Message-ID: <d71426460605170604s60373632ta53bdb2db37f0c1e@mail.gmail.com>

Hi I am a new Paraview user trying to build Paraview from source.
The process works fine (CMake, building Paraview etc) until I run INSTALL
(the project workspace file in VC++).
I get the following output, with some type of spawning error...


Running cmake script file cmake_install.cmake

2.4/source/binaries/bin/Debug/paraview.exe
to install.

INSTALL - 1 error(s), 0 warning(s)



Does anyone know why it this file, C:/Program Files/ParaView
2.4/source/binaries/bin/Debug/paraview.exe,
was not found/created?
It is not located in this folder so I believe perhaps it is a problem with a
previous step that did not return an error.

Any help would be greatly appreciated
Thanks

Ah I see. What kind of dataset is this? Unstructured or curvilinear?

What version of Visual Studio are you using, and which patch release 
of ParaView 2.4 are you trying to install?  I just tried to reproduce 
the behavior you describe using ParaView version 2.4 from CVS 
(includes some changes since the 2.4.3 patch release), but the 
INSTALL target ran with no problems using Visual Studio .NET 2003. We 
haven't committed anything on the ParaView-2-4 CVS branch since the 
2.4.3 patch release that should have affected installation.

I am using Visual Studio 6.0 with the latest stable release of Paraview (
2.4.3) but i am not on the CVS.

I will be trying to build again, assuming yours and many other have worked i
would expect the same.

Thanks

Hi Shawn,

I just finished trying to reproduce the problem on a machine here 
that has VS 6.0 installed. I used ParaView 2.4.3 instead of the CVS 
version, but I could not the problem you describe; when I ran the 
INSTALL target, it completed with no errors.

Amy,
I cant seem to find anything wrong with the cmake file.

I am going to reinstall the paraview source v2.4.3 (only the source, not the
installer) and use the CMake v2.2 as the compiler. Any other suggestions
before i proceed?

Thanks, Shawn

In order to keep the ParaView build as simple as possible, the only 
CMake parameter I changed was CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX (the path prefix 
for installing ParaView). I used CMake 2.2.3. I don't have any other 
suggestions.

Subject: [Paraview] Unstructured Grids with Zones
Message-ID: <BAY115-W8219EBB994BF7EDA49E6EDEA60@phx.gbl>

I am attempting to write a native paraview reader for open foam.  OpenFoam has multiple zones/regions.  They have an internal mesh, boundary meshs(consisting of faces), and face/point/cellzones  (made up of subsets of the mesh).  so I need to create an unstructured grid that has regions/zones, would be best if each region could be toggled on and off, so the user could view all the regions or some of the regions...etc.  could someone point me in the direction of the class I should be using to do this?Thanks in advance.

Subject: [Paraview] Adding GenericProbeFilter to Paraview
Message-ID: <d71426460605181046k208acb8dsfeb5ba341fc92395@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I am adding the filter vtkGenericProbeFilter.vtk to paraview and believe to
have coded the .xml and .pvsm files properly. When i load paraview my filter
does not appear in the filter list, nor does it appear in the pipeline if i
import it directly (i have set my PV_INT_PATH correctly)

I have incuded the aforementioned files. Syntax wise i believe the only
command to question would be the line:

<ProxyProperty name="ProbeWith" command="SetInput">

as in, perhaps there is a different method name for calling for the input
object? This from what i see in the docs is correct.

Any help is appreciated. Thanks
Shawn

Subject: [Paraview] Compilling PV with offscreen support
Message-ID: <20060518181047.6F8FF727B4@mailhost.nacad.ufrj.br>


Hi all,

After that discussion regarding client/server modes in PV I got curious
about how the offscreen rendering would work on the system I have access.
Since then I've been trying to compile PV with MPI and offscreen rendering
support. I haven't found on the ParaView Guide (old version) how could I do
it. I've already locate the Mesa library on the system I'm trying to compile
PV (SGI Altix) but I'm not sure if I need the VTK compiled with Mesa and
which field should I fill in on the cmake's configuration. Does anyone could
guide me?

Thanks for any help

NOTE: I guess a short instruction on the Wiki page regarding this topic
would be very helpful.

What are you trying to do?

GenericProbeFilter works on GenericDataSet objects. GenericDataSet is an abstract class made for external packages for unstructured grid with higher order elements.
It makes sense to use it if you have a reader that reads your file and returns a GenericDataSet object:
1. It means you have a concrete class of GenericDataSet implemented somewhere.
2. You have a reader that creates an object of the concrete class of GenericDataSet from your file.
3. You have also a pvsm and xml files for this reader

There are a couple of filters already in ParaView that work on a GenericDataSet object (GenericClip, GenericContour, GenericCut, GenericGeometryFilter, GenericOutlineFilter, GenericStreamTracer. GenericDataSetTessellator).

If they don't show up, it is because you don't have a reader that returns a GenericDataSet.

Regards.

Ok that explains why its not regestering. Since i would rather deal with a
non-generic data type, do you know of any particular vtkFilter that allows
me to implement this method on regular data?
My intention is to allow for a plane to be input input in the probe filter
(or a similarily functional filter), which is not available in the probe
function currently.

Thanks

You may try the cut filter to get a slice of your dataset according to a given plane.

Can you add a feature request for a line widget for the probe filter in the ParaView bug tracker, please?

Terry,

I have had considerable success using the EnSight reader in paraview and 
"breaking" my data into EnSight "parts."  PV has a filter called Extract 
Parts that, in essence, gives one the ability to turn freely each part 
on or off for viewing.  I also double check the correctness of my 
boundary conditions which are applied either to point-sets or to 
surface-facet-sets by making each one a "part."

Subject: [Paraview] Probe filter Input
Message-ID: <d71426460605191122hf5dca12t5373be8d03eb1350@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I wish to make the probe filter take in any source as an input object . The
current Probe filter calls the "GetInput" method to set the input as a line
or point, but when i call this method with a general object, my filter does
not appear on the filter list.

this input will allow any object so i should be ok. In the vtkProbeFilter
code i cannot find any method SetInput so i am assuming it is inherited from
above somewhere, since it works for a point/line already.

Should i have to change my SetInput call? any suggestions appreciated.
thanks

You are going down the wrong path. Look at these posts:

http://public.kitware.com/pipermail/paraview/2006-March/002818.html

Your problem is very similar in that you want to change the hard-wired input
of the probe filter (Stephen wanted to change the input of the streamline
filter). I will forward you the configuration files for the stream tracer.
Looking at those, you should be able to figure out how to write a new
configuration for a probe filter.

I have made the necessary changes as far as i can see:
a) a second input was added to the .xml to account for the desired object
probe
b) <InputProperty name="Source"    line in the .pvsm was modified to match
the .xml

I will update my source with the latest cvs version, as this is still
necessary for my changes as well, correct?

Thanks for the help

Maybe I should clarify.I am looking for a class that will allow me to combine multiple unstructured grids into on type/class.I
would like to write that out to a file that when opened in paraview
would display flags that would allow me to visualize only certain grids.I am currently writing a translator that will be converting to a reader.Thanks.

Message-ID: <57A223C7-625D-4A1F-945A-C6DE43455992@student.dtu.dk>

Hi,

I have made a program that outputs the results in file0001, -002,  
-003, -004... etc in .vtk files (timestep solutions).

Suppose my geometry ranges from x = [0; 0.1] and y = [0;0.1], and I  
want to plot the 2D-function (z = 0), y = f(x) = 23*x^2 - 2*x + 0.05  
on top of my geometry, how would I do that?

I suppose I could make a program that makes some very small spacings  
dx and then I could probably connect each coordinate by a straight  
line... But there's probably a better method, I hope?

I don't know about this tcl/tk interface - perhaps that could be  
usen? I've no experience with tcl/tk, but somehow I think there must  
exist an easy solution to my problem....?


TIA,


Regards,
Martin

Do i need to do something to enable them or I must compile  a version

the current latest version is 2.4.3. You can create an example of AMR
data from the Source menu, using "Hierachical Fractal" which creates an
object of type Hierarchical AMR. You will see that the filters are
multi-block- (and AMR-) aware. No need for a special set of filters.

You presumably have your own data simulation. in what format? Writing a
reader for it might not be too difficult based on the example of
multi-block readers available in paraview.

Subject: [Paraview] clean to grid question...
Message-ID: <20060523143029.8915D727E5@mailhost.nacad.ufrj.br>


Hello everybody,

I have a silly doubt regarding the "clean to grid" filter (just to confirm
my suspicions...).

This filter is able to merge entities that are within a merging tolerance
according to the PV guide. I guess it's a wonderful feature to work with
partitioned models due to parallelism without having to rebuild the original
(non partitioned)  model. However, when cleaning interfaces due to
paralellization (those surfaces between MPI partitions) it seems that the
user MUST apply the "append datasets" filter before trying to cleaning it,
isn't it?!

This question came to my mind after loading a model with the SOS format in
PV-2.4.3. I know, I know, the Ensight readers have not been working fine in
PV-2.4.3 yet and some filters are not associated with the reader
accordingly. When using parallel file formats the user have several parts of
models (written in different files) that are loaded together as it was only
one file and model, so, the need of the "append datasets" filter, I think,
is not evident. Maybe, the "append datasets" should be automatically called
when loading parallel formats.

Renato,

If I understand your question, you can just run the D3 filter. You do
not need to run the 'clean to grid' filter because D3 will do that for
you and it will also compute ghost cells in between processors.

Ok, I've also tried the D3 filter but I still have the interfaces between
MPI partitions.

Take a look at this: http://www.nacad.ufrj.br/~rnelias/paraview/pv-figs/

As you can seen the interfaces are still there.

NOTE: I only got the interfaces cleaned if I load the case files,
individually, and after applying the "append datasets" and "clean to grid"
filters. However, it's only possible when running PV-2.2.1 (due to the
reader I'm using) and in serial mode.

Thanks for your hints

Ahh.. You have to invoke a filter that will request ghost cells (like extract surface) before D3 will compute ghost cells. :)

Try adding an 'Extract Surface' filter after D3 and then show the surface in wireframe. :)

What Brian is suggesting is definitely the way to go. However, it may not
work. The EnSight reader produces the new multi-block format (hence all the
issues in 2.4) and D3 might not work well with it. This is something we will
address in the next release.

I see, I tried what Brian suggested without success. Certainly the problem
is due to the Ensight reader in PV-4.2.3...I'll keep waiting the next PV
release anxiously  ;-)
 
thanks a lot 
 
Renato.

Subject: [Paraview] Extract constants from Ensight gold case files
Message-ID: <1148471189.6648.13.camel@icarus.flyg.kth.se>

Hi,


has anyone out there found a way to access the "constant per case"
values out of Ensight gold .case files?

Here's an example of a .case file:


      * FORMAT
      * type: ensight gold
      * 
      * GEOMETRY
      * model: dwing_65_sharple.geo
      * 
      * VARIABLE
      * constant per case:   1  Pressure     323819.72 323819.72
        323819.72
      * constant per case:   1  Temperature     293.15 293.15 293.15
      * constant per case:   1  Velocity0     126.367676 126.367676
        126.367676
      * constant per case:   1  Velocity1     -0.0 -0.0 -0.0
      * constant per case:   1  Velocity2     53.639896 53.639896
        53.639896
      * constant per case:   1  Gamma     1.4 1.4 1.4
      * constant per case:   1  Rgas     287.0 287.0 287.0
      * constant per case:   1  Mu_reference     1.7894E-5 1.7894E-5
        1.7894E-5
      * constant per case:   1  Prantl_number     0.72 0.72 0.72
      * constant per case:   1  Dyamic_pressure     36267.812 36267.812
        36267.812
      * scalar per node:   1  density   dwing_65_sharple.density****
      * vector per node:   1  velocity   dwing_65_sharple.velocity****
      * scalar per node:   1  pressure   dwing_65_sharple.pressure****
      * scalar per node:   1  turb_work_vt
        dwing_65_sharple.turb_work_vt****
      * scalar per node:   1  turb_kin_energy
        dwing_65_sharple.turb_kin_energy****
      * scalar per node:   1  turb_viscosity
        dwing_65_sharple.turb_viscosity****
      * 
      * TIME
      * time set: 1   Model
      * number of steps: 3
      * filename start number: 7600
      * filename increment: 25
      * time values: 0.038 0.038125 0.03825



I would like to access some of the "constant per case" values from
say ... within the calculator.



Thanks, Simone

I've compiled paraview (server side) with osmesa but I always get the 
error message shown in the snapshot attached (on the client side). 
Options for paraview include use offscreen and use osmesa

I note that although mesa supplies GLU and OSMesa32, the vtk/paraview 
libs (eg vtkRendering) are all still linking against libGL - which in 
turn uses X.

Here are some settings

Hi John, 

I'm not an expert but I've faced this problem recently trying (for several
times) to compile and run PV in offscreen mode. 
Your message is not an error message. It's a message warning that you don't
have rendering resources on your server and that you're not using (or PV is
not able to run) in off screen mode. 

Have you launched pvserver with --use-offscreen-rendering flag?

Cheers

NOTE: After 4 times I finally compiled PV with Mesa ;-)

I am able to open the paraview workspace but upon building, VS C++ crashes
and im forced to shut down each time. I am trying to compile the latest CVS
version (uploaded yesterday may 23). Has anyone had any similar problems
with this?
thanks

Imagine how happy I am that I hadn't thought of that :)

OK. The warning about compositing goes away now, but instead I get
this...(when I force compositing)

Hi John,

after comparing my compilation options with yours I found some differences:

>  OPENGL_INCLUDE_DIR               /home/biddisco/Mesa-6.5/include
>  OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY                /usr/lib/libGL.so
>  OPENGL_glu_LIBRARY               /home/biddisco/Mesa-6.5/lib/libGLU.so
>  OPENGL_xmesa_INCLUDE_DIR         OPENGL_xmesa_INCLUDE_DIR-NOTFOUND
>  OSMESA_INCLUDE_DIR               /home/biddisco/Mesa-6.5/include
>  OSMESA_LIBRARY
/home/biddisco/Mesa-6.5/lib/libOSMesa32.so
>  VTK_OPENGL_HAS_OSMESA            ON
>  VTK_USE_MANGLED_MESA             OFF
>  VTK_USE_MPI                      ON
>  VTK_USE_OFFSCREEN                ON

in my case, besides using Mesa 6.2.1 instead of 6.5 -- don't ask me why I've
used this version ;-) -- I also redirected all OpenGL lib and include
references to Mesa, thus:

>  OPENGL_INCLUDE_DIR
/home/nacad/rnelias/lib/Mesa-6.2.1/include
>  OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY
/home/nacad/rnelias/lib/Mesa-6.2.1/lib/libGL.so
>  OPENGL_glu_LIBRARY
/home/nacad/rnelias/lib/Mesa-6.2.1/lib/libGLU.so
>  OPENGL_xmesa_INCLUDE_DIR
/home/nacad/rnelias/lib/Mesa-6.2.1/include
>  OSMESA_INCLUDE_DIR
/home/nacad/rnelias/lib/Mesa-6.2.1/include
>  OSMESA_LIBRARY
/home/nacad/rnelias/lib/Mesa-6.2.1/lib/libOSMesa.so
>  VTK_OPENGL_HAS_OSMESA            ON
>  VTK_USE_MANGLED_MESA             OFF
>  VTK_USE_MPI                      ON
>  VTK_USE_OFFSCREEN                ON

I also compiled with shared libs (otherwise you'll get a binary with a huge
size) and turned off the option which build the GUI binaries (paraview e
pvclient) since I don't intend to run PV GUI on the server I'm using.

Hope it help you

Regards

Renato.

What settings did you use in cmake? Did you try 'make test' after
building Paraview? How far did it get? Do other X/GL applications seem
OK? 

That's all the random questions that jump to mind right now without more
info.

No.  Your .pvsm (server manager XML file) should still use SetInput. 
FillInputPortInformation specifies what type of input the filter 
accepts, but SetInput actually sets the input to the filter.

That reminded me of this error I used to get with my system GL which is
Mesa with DRI, all the osmesa headers, but without the OSMesa library. I
guess it's the 'MakeCurrent' part that seems familiar.

X Error of failed request:  GLXBadContext
  Major opcode of failed request:  144 (GLX)
  Minor opcode of failed request:  5 (X_GLXMakeCurrent)
  Serial number of failed request:  31500

I agree with Renato N. Elias the use of the system libGL.so with the
mesa include, and libGLU.so, and no xmesa.h is probably a problem. I've
had the best results so far using the latest stable Mesa-6.4.2 without
mangling as my only GL. To get CMake to find this version before the
system version I set some variables in my ~/.bash_profile

CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH=~/Mesa-6.4.2/lib64

and 

CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH=~/Mesa-6.4.2/include

This saves me a bunch of screw ups entering things into CMake. It also
helps CMake to put the VTK and ITK dirs in there for building projects.

Kevin,

I hadn't tried make test, when I run make test all the ParaView related
tests fail. So there is something wrong with the build.
I built a release version with GNU compilers, is there something in
particular that I need to look out for?

There is no problem with other X applications.

Thanks,
-Tuhin

Can you post your CMakeCache.txt? Maybe someone will find some problem with
flags...

Berk Geveci is right you should post the CMakeCache.txt. If it's too big
it might bounce off the list, and you'll have to post it to a web page.
In any case, try to describe the changes you made in CMake.

It might be useful to start with a clean build directory, and make no
changes in CMake and try the tests. Then restart and make one change,
then two... Until you find out when it works, and when it doesn't.

If it is too big, don't worry about it. I'll approve it and it'll go
through.

Thanks Berk.

I have an update, it turns out that the drive where ParaView was trying to
write the .Paraview* files was full. So now I don't get a segmentation fault
but the program exits with an "Illegal instruction" message. I'll post the
CMakeCache.txt if I don't make any headway until the end of the day.

Really appreciate your help.

Subject: [Paraview] Display scalar output from a filter
Message-ID: <d71426460605251244o3861346oc1160d099102d4cb@mail.gmail.com>

I have a vtk filter (vtkMassProperties) that calculates scalar values for
surfaceArea and Volume.
I would like to display these values on Paraview's parameters widget after
running the filter on a data set.

the clip and integrate attribute filters produce a similar desired display
but the server manager and xml files for these do not reveal how this output
is displayed.
There are getSurfaceArea and GetVolume calls that are visible within the
scope of the code, so i have set the appropriate command to such.

the filter still does not regester, so I have included my files...i have a
feeling i may be on the wrong track
any help is appreciated

Subject: [Paraview] One Isosurface always in front?
Message-ID: <e8289c090605251426t3080d522u16f7f76d05331592@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am running ParaView 2.4.3 or 2.5 and am seeing something unexpected:

I am loading two separate 3-D images saved as legacy vtk files and
attempting to render isosurfaces of the data.  the images are thresholded,
such that all the pixels in image1 are equal to 10, and all the pixels in
image2 are equal to 20 (just for example).  each image defines an object
that is distinct in space from objects in the other image.  so far, this is
working fine: i read in both images, render an isosurface at value 10 for
image 1, at 20 for image 2, and i can color them separately without any
trouble.  problem is, when i set some  transparency values to the
isosurfaces and then rotate the volume to get a different angle, one of the
isosurfaces occludes the other such that it is entirely invisible.  in case
that is not clear, here are a couple images of what i am talking about:

http://ncmir.ucsd.edu/~bryan/PVimage001.jpg
http://ncmir.ucsd.edu/~bryan/PVimage002.jpg
http://ncmir.ucsd.edu/~bryan/PVimage003.jpg

so the gray blob in the top left corner of PVimage001.jpg appears to have
jumped to the foreground in PVimage002.jpg, even though the green one, in
reality, should be in front.

can someone please tell me what i am doing wrong (and/or if you need more
info to help troubleshoot this)?

thanks,
bryan

it is entirely invisible.  in case that is not 
clear, here are a couple images of what i am 
talking about:

http://ncmir.ucsd.edu/~bryan/PVimage002.jpg
http://ncmir.ucsd.edu/~bryan/PVimage003.jpg

so the gray blob in the top left corner of 
PVimage001.jpg appears to have jumped to the 
foreground in PVimage002.jpg, even though the 
green one, in reality, should be in front.

can someone please tell me what i am doing wrong 
(and/or if you need more info to help 
troubleshoot this)?

thanks,

Pointer to  solution to SegFault problem. Also exists on latest cvs 2.5.0 
Compiling on Ubuntu with GNU. 

Error occurs in the Lookmark modules particularly in void vtkPVLookmark::UpdateWidgetValues() where line 715  this->CreateDatasetList(); returns a null.

So commenting out all Lookmark support brings the application back up. But giventhis information I have no idea how to fix it.

Subject: [Paraview] How to calculate offsets in <AppendedData>
Message-ID: <4421C6AD-C407-44B5-85D4-1A254D39B76A@ed.ac.uk>

Dear All,

I've been trying to write out XML formatted data files from a Fortran  
flow solver for use in Paraview,  I have now reached the point where  
the file can be read, provided only one variable is contained in the  
appended data (written in the raw format) and the offset is 0.  I  
have tried calculating offsets based on
1) distance into the 1D array, counting in bytes
2) distance into the 1D array, counting in 4 byte words
neither seems to work.

I've looked at .vti files saved by Paraview itself and the offsets  
don't seem to make sense (for a 10x3 grid, containing cell data the  
first variable is offset at 0 and the second at 48).  If anyone can  
offer assistance I'd be grateful, the file-formats.pdf just describes  
offset as an offset!

I apologise if this is a naive question, but any help would be much  
appreciated

For you information the XML file is as follows

<VTKFile type="ImageData" version="0.1" byte_order="BigEndian">
<ImageData WholeExtent="0   10    0    3    0    0"
   Origin="0.0000E+00  0.0000E+00  0.0000E+00"
   Spacing="0.5000E+00  0.3333E+00  0.1000E+01">
   <Piece Extent="0   10    0    3    0    0">
    <CellData Scalars="Pressure">
     <DataArray Name="Isolid" type="Int32" format="ascii">

-1 -1 -1 -1 -1

     </DataArray>
     <DataArray Name="Velocity" type="Float32" format="append"  
offset="0"
      NumberOfComponents="2" />
     <DataArray Name="Pressure" type="Float32" format="append"  
offset="60" />
    </CellData>
   </Piece>
</ImageData>
<AppendedData encoding="raw">
_?????...
</AppendedData>
</VTKFile>

looking at the Appended data using bin2hex shows (8 byte groups)

In this case the 2D velocity vector is (1.0, 0.0) and the pressure is

Thanks to all, I have now got it mostly working, for reference should 
anyone  check the archives

I discovered that one must build Mesa twice,
once "make linux-static", then again with "make linux-osmesa32"
then you get the build of the GL lib and the additional offscreen osmesa
libs. I hadn't realized theat building osmesa didn't also built the core
GL lib - hence I didn't have the GL lib and linked against the default
GL. Note that I fell back to using Mesa-6.4.2 and this configuration
works (I suspect 6.5 wil work too now that I know what to do).
(NB. Building mesa as dynamic caused crashes every time.)

then mpirun -np X -machinefile Y pvserver --use-offscreen-rendering

and it seems to work. Forcing compositing to always gives an image with
reasonable performance (or at least comparable to transferring geometry
with small results), and probably better with large results.

Distributed compositing appears to work too.

Only one problem left : When I resize the window in paraview, all the 
server nodes segfault. (yes, I checked the MAX_WIDTH, MAX_HEIGHT 
variable in osmmesa/config.h). It starts up ok and I can use it as long 
as I don't resize the window.

>>>> (NB. Building mesa as dynamic caused crashes every time.) <<<

Just to confirm: Have you added the Mesa's library path in your
LD_LIBRARY_PATH enviroment variable before running PV?

In my case, I've built Mesa 6.2.1 as shared library with "make linux"
compilation command. It produced all libraries needed (OSMesa, GL and GLU).
I also compiled PV with shared libraries in order to reduce the binary size
but before running PV I *MUST* load the following enviromment:

setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH
/home/nacad/rnelias/lib/Mesa-6.2.1/lib:/home/nacad/rnelias/bin/paraview-2.4.
3-mesa/lib/paraview-2.4:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}
setenv DISPLAY localhost:0

(note: my shel is csh otherwise the command setenv should be replaced by
export --> Ok, ok, everybody knows it...)

And everything works nicely ;-)

Renato.

That's strange. I know that the other way around builds both. That is
"make linux-x86" and "make linux-x86-64" both build GL, GLU, GLX... and
OSMesa.

Hmm? It worked for me. What version of Paraview are you using again? I
now see Renato N. Elias' comment about LD_LIBRARY_PATH, which reminds me
that when I add my Mesa shared libs to CMake I get the rpath question in
cmake. I'm using the CVS HEAD of both ParaView and CMake.

Subject: [Paraview] Creating a reader: Problem with extension
Message-ID: <BAY115-W7D3D1BE24AB9F7B73296BDE9E0@phx.gbl>

I am working on a reader for OpenFOAM and encountering a problem.  OpenFOAM is a group of files with no extensions.  The file I inital open is called controlDict, so I used "controlDict" as my "extensions".  This workaround allows me to see my files but if I just select it when doing a file open I get an error (it tries to attach the first extensions in the Paraview files list) "File XXXX does not exist".  So I have to choose "OpenFOAM Files" in "Files of Type" which allows me to proceed and is followed by another error "Could not find an appropiate reader file XXXX. Would you like to manually select the reader of this file?".  From here I can select my reader, again, and it does work, but this is going to be a headache for any one who uses this.  I have asked the OpenFoam developers if the can add a file extension and they are unwilling.  Is there anyway this can be fixed on the paraview side?

Thanks.

hi All,
Do any one know what is the expected behaviour of the paraview contour
filter when its input is an overlapping AMR subdomains. will it works
fine or there will be a cracks cause this feature hasn't been handled
yet ?

Message-ID: <d71426460605290716j729cf7e5k8491c7066520501f@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I have a vtk filter (vtkMassProperties) that calculates scalar values for
surfaceArea and Volume.
I would like to display these values on Paraview's parameters widget after
running the filter on a data set.

the clip and integrate attribute filters produce a similar desired
displayalong with many other filters. I believe the output is automatically
written when the PrintSelf method is called within the vtk class.

the filter is available in the menu, and appears to process the data set (as
it requires time to execute) although no scalar output is displayed

i have included my server manager and xml files for reference
any sugggentions are appreciated

Subject: [Paraview] paraview breaks with a file
Message-ID: <447BF59C.4000104@cognitdesign.com>

Hello Everybody,

I'm trying to use paraview to visualize CFD results. For starters, I
just wanted to import the geometry to see if it worked (I've had to
write a parser for the results file since I do not know how to write an
import module). I'm having a lot of problems with this file since after
debugging all the errors (of so I thought) paraview breaks when I try to
open the file. Obviously, it does not give any error message (unless non
that I know of)
I really need to be able to convert those files for post processing.
Thank you for your help.
The file is about 180Kb compressed. I can posted if you tell me where.

I'd like to report to the VTK list that I was able to create the volume
rendered movies that I wanted on our cluster with the use of Paraview
and the ordered composting option. Creating the movie on my workstation
took most of 4 days. Creating another version on our cluster with twice
the number of frames took about 6 hours. The speed scaled almost
perfectly with the number of processors.

The method is definitely able to handle data sets that are to large to
volume render on my workstation, but I haven't used it yet to produce
more than a few frames from that data.

Thanks everyone!

Subject: [Paraview] Question about mangled mesa/osmesa
Message-ID: <447E0BFF.3080501@cora.nwra.com>

As of FC5, Fedora has stopped shipping libOSMesa because the upstream 
mesa project has made it very difficult (impossible?) to build a single 
libGL that supports both DRI and OSMesa.  I'm looking into packaging a 
mangled mesa version for Fedora Extras that paraview could use.  My 
question is: when using VTK_USE_MANGLED_MESA, is the resulting paraview 
able to use both the "native" OpenGL (Mesa with DRI in this case) as 
well as the OSMesa library provided by the mangled version, or do you 
need separately compiled paraviews for the two uses?  I'm assuming the 
former is the case when using VTK_OPENGL_HAS_OSMESA.

Thanks!

Building Mangled Mesa for Fedora Extras is a good idea! I've never had
ParaView with mesa and mangled mesa working though. I hear the mangling
in the newest stable version is broken somehow.

I've always assumed VTK_USE_MANGLED_MESA and VTK_OPENGL_HAS_OSMESA were
mutually exclusive, because if OpenGL had an OSMesa I wouldn't need a
Mangled Mesa. Maybe that's why it never works for me.
