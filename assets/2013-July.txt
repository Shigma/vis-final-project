Subject: [Paraview] Calculation of the normal gradient on a boundary face
Message-ID: <CA+pRetjYZVp9yB8OtX4631iRNvJunfxf1Z0=0kmkAHjc5=CKNg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have a problem with something a priori easy to calculate but in which I
really don't succeed to do...

I want to calculate a heat flux in a flat plate (with a thickness) and so I
calculate the gradient of the temperature (with
GradientOfUnstucturedDataSet). In then take the component of the gradient
which is normal to the face I want to have the heat flux.

In the solid, the values given are good (non zero) and equal to the
theoretical values, ok...

But when I want to show the normal component of gradient on a boundary face
by using ExtractBlock and then ExtractSurface, the values of the gradient
are 0 everywhere... But in the volume it is still non zero !

Here are pictures showing the problem. In the first image, I plot the
temperature on a flat plate (with thickness) and I calculate the gradient.
I have compared to the theorical values and it is okay.

In the second image, I wanted to plot the value of the gradient in a
boundary face of the flat plate but I have 0 everywhere...(which is however
calculated in the volume... I have also tried to project the values by
using "PointDataToCellData" and "Cell centers" but it doesn't work...

Is it a bug ?
I'm using Paraview 4.0 on ubuntu 12.10.

This page talks about how to split views froms Python :
http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Python_Scripting#Updating_View_Layout
That should help with writing a script that splits view and shows
different filters in different views.

Pradeep,
I believe the answer is no, ParaView doesn't yet have an easy way to set numerous lights directions, colors and intensities.  I wrote up a bug a few months ago, and I believe it has now been moved to active development.

Hello,

I am using PV 3.98. I saw some earlier posts which mention that PV does not have an intuitive way of handling the Light direction and intensity. I was wondering if it is still the case for PV 3.98 or is there a easy way of  handling light? I have been trying the Light option in Edit->Settings menu but it is not very easy to use.

Ideally I would like specify the coordinates of my light source and its direction and intensity. Any ideas how can I go about doing this?

Thanks!

Hello,

Can I change the way I interact with the the 3D view to fly mode??.

in Settings -> Render View -> Camera , there is no way to put the fly 
mode like in the very very very old ParaView. 
(http://bebendorf.ins.uni-bonn.de/teaching/Praktikum_SS13/ParaView_UserGuide.pdf)

Maybe using the python console??

Thanks to all.

It would be a nice feature to have. Earlier we realized that we need this
option for supporting ParaView in VR environments as well where Eye may not
necessarily be
at the same location as Camera.

Classification: UNCLASSIFIED
Caveats: NONE

We're using ParaView 4.0.1 to read in some (large) CTH datasets, and the
reader is spewing gobs of output.  I think that they are warning messages,
but it may be  indicative of something going wrong under behind the curtain.

The message that we're seeing is:

Warning in:
...../paraview/src/paraview/ParaViewCore/ClientServerCore/Core/vtkPVProgress
Hander.cxx
Line 261:  vtkSpyPlotReader reported invalid progress [2.4]
Value must be between [0,1]
Clamping to this range

It seems as though the progress value is reporting a lot of values > 1!
8-)

Hi all,

given a set of parallel Exodus file, output.e.{1,2,3,...}, I can open the

Is there a way to visualize the distribution of the elements between the

Rick,
Do you have a debug build?  I was thinking that error message was turned off for release.

Also, I believe I have a dataset that replicates the bug.  It is basically a bug created by multiple files being processed in parallel, and ParaView is confusing how many files it is processing total, and how many the particular core is processing.

Alan

Message-ID: <CAEc0-qL6vd36GLgfodG9pFj9CPR-Yh2DVXsQtM4v5iZcmXTU2w@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

I have 2D elevation data and I want to convert it into vtk text file to
load it to Paraview. I want to load just the required information. I think
this is called Uniform Rectilinear 2D grid maybe in VTK. I do not want to
include each and every x y z points as we just need this to be somewhere in
header. in the body, I have z data only and sometime attributes.

I appreciate if someone can provide simple example for this 2D grid.

Thank you in advance

Rick,
Do you have a debug build?  I was thinking that error message was turned off for release.

Also, I believe I have a dataset that replicates the bug.  It is basically a bug created by multiple files being processed in parallel, and ParaView is confusing how many files it is processing total, and how many the particular core is processing.

Alan

Is there an easy way to tell the calculator that K is real and NOT integer?

What's the "**" operator? I don't think the calculator supports a "**"
use "*" for multiply or "^" for power. Also what's the "Function"
you're typing in the Calculator. I ask since the errors says "see
position 15" but "K**2" doesn't have 15 characters.

I have a 64-bit linux machine so I downloaded the 64-bit version of 4.01.
However, I write my PV files are 32-bits (or at least the files say 
32-bit), could that be a source of confusion for the 64-bit PV?
Maybe this was done when we had bot 32-bit and 64-bit machines. I will 
write 64-bit hereafter to avoid any problem.

_*2nd-Point*_: when using the calculator with 4.01
If I want to calculate
0.09*Density*K^2/Epsilon
I enter
0.09 and select *
I get
*0.09 and not 0.09*
then I select the scalar Density
I get
Density0.09* and NOT
0.09*Density (or Density*0.09)
older version use left-to-right entries but 4.01 uses right-to-left entries
Hope this makes some sense.
Thanks,
Stephen

Subject: [Paraview] Display error in paraview > 3.98
Message-ID: <20130702170103.17394g0kfohios8w@mel.coria.fr>

Hi.
I have a display issue which surely makes work a pain. Since 3.98  
appeared, I keep getting strange display artifacts.
Scenario: I would import data, do something, then, say, click on a  
menu or try to resize Paraview window, and the 3dview window goes  
white (or yellow, or covered in apparently random artifacts).
See the screenshot (before and after, I resized the window).

http://imc.pcz.pl/external/4.0_bug.png

The artifacts dissapear when I click in the 3d view again. So it is  
still usable, but very annoing. Imagine seeing this 76 times a minute  
when you're preparing a complex visualization!

Affects Paraview > 3.98. Versions <  3.98 work perfectly and the error  
isn't there (e.g. I've been testing 3.14 for an hour yesterday to  
confirm this). Hence I presume something has changed in the code  
itself between the versions, that affects my setup.
  I am using paraview version 4.0.1 included in Debian, but the same  
occurs using binaries from kitware.org (checked 3.98 and 4.01). My  
video card is:

$lspci |grep -i vga

01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.  
[AMD/ATI] RV515/M52 [Mobility Radeon X1300]

(which means Ati Radeon x1300) on a free drivers.
Note: when adding some kernel parameters I was able to change the  
character of the artifacts (like modeset=1) changes them to mostly  
yellow. But that's hardly helping...

Of course I can supply more info.

regards
Wojtek

Message-ID: <CALVsm19AnBR0=eXqR85tRFoSxGWypn+tZ8whwVaU1G_L+KWqag@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Folks,

I'm evaluating the possibility of using vtkHyperOctree for my code, and I
have three questions:

-Is there any [working] example of a simple xml *.vto file available
somewhere?
-In vtkXMLHyperOctreeWriter Class documentation, there is a reference
to vtkXMLPHyperOctreeWriter
but it doesn't seem to be implemented yet, is it planned?
-Although vtkHyperOctree was optimized for computation within a single
thread, can the trees be grouped in some sort of *.pvto file?

Cheers.

Nick

Yes, I noticed the calculator doing that as well.  I think the intended 
behavior is to insert the text wherever the cursor was last placed.  And 
if the cursor was never manually placed anywhere, it would append it to 
the end.  It seems to be resetting the cursor to the first position instead.

For now, I just type everything in.

Yup, I see that too. I'll have fix merged into master soon. For the
release however, you'll have to type manually for now.

Subject: [Paraview] Trying to plot a grid-centered value over time
Message-ID: <CAHMqPZGRjO7T2wV0uo6RWmsVWBD0iMGFzEA_tACMu0oZMVSsZA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello!

This is my first time using a mailing list so I hope im doing it right.

Im working on a project where I write information from a physics engine
into a HDF5 file, generate a XDMF file from a python script that connects
to the HDF5 data and then open the xml file in paraview to plot it. Right
now I have a 3D-grid with position points and velocities and this works
fine, it steps forward in time and moves just as expected.

The positions are for example
<Attribute Center="Node" Name="position" Type="Vector">
in the xml file.

The problem arises when I have a single scalar value for each time-step
that I want to plot against time. I connect it through xdmf as such
<Attribute Center="Grid" Name="anMomBW" Type="Scalar">

as far as I understand this should be one value per time step for the
entire grid. It shows up in paraview as a global value (I think, it has
another symbol atleast) under data arrays. I have tried alot of different
plot options such as "plot global variables over time" but cant locate the
variable.

Any help would be appreciated, Thanks
//Johan

The annual IEEE Scientific Visualization Contest is happening now!
This year's contest covers gene expression in the developing mouse
brain, courtesy of the Allen Institute for Brain Science.  The data
set tracks the level of gene expression for ~2000 genes in a 3D mouse
brain from embryonic stages through adulthood. These expression levels
are recorded within annotated 3D anatomical regions that change size
and shape (and even divide) during development.

The goals for contest participants is to help identify spatial and
temporal gene expression patterns in this complex data set.
Have a look at the contest website for more details:
http://sciviscontest.ieeevis.org/2013/

Submissions are due at the end of July, 2013.
We  look forward to your submissions!

	(13.3.0-12.5.0)
Message-ID: <9501459A-07BE-412C-94C0-E2A57ECCBD7E@ornl.gov>

We are having difficulty building paraview with the pgi compiler on a large cray system. pgCC does not seem to recognize the "!="  for a certain class of functions. We have tried several versions of the pgi compiler. Has anyone encountered this? Is there a patch or a workaround?

Here is the error.

"/ccs/proj/nfi010/ParaView/ParaView-3.98.1-source/VTK/Rendering/Context2D/vtkAbstractContextItem.cxx", line 167: error:
no operator "!=" matches these operands
operand types are: vtkContextScenePrivate::const_reverse_iterator
!= std::reverse_iterator<vtkAbstractContextItem **>
this->Children->rbegin(); it != this->Children->rend(); ++it)

Many thanks,

We have seen this issue with const_reverse_iterators before on older

VTK_CONST_REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON in the build directory file

Subject: [Paraview] PV intermittent display images
Message-ID: <51D44070.6070100@inria.fr>

I create an contour image using PV 4.01 using a 4 million point 
unstructured mesh. I see the image 1 sec, the next instance it 
disappears from my screen. If I move the mouse, or right click on the 
screen the image sometimes comes back for an instance. I cannot get the 
image to stay on my screen. I noticed the  problem  with large meshes.

I don't believe it is a PV problem, maybe,  but rather associated to my 
linux fedora 64-bit workstation. Has anyone experienced similar 
disappearing images? I need to pinpoint the problem as I am blocked.
Thanks,
Stephen

If you turn on immediate mode rendering and play with settings, does the problem go away?
I had some strange effects recently, but I can't remember the details.

Subject: pvtu file displaying issue
To: paraview at paraview.org


Dear all,

I had some problem with Paraview to display pvtu file correctly. The
followings are the details.


==== Key word: ====
vtu file, pvtu file, Paraview, random non-zero values shown

==== Background: ====
I have two vtu files, both of which have one-dimensional unstructured mesh.
File 1 (HeatConductionCOuput_0.vtu) has PointData, with name "stress". File
2 (SodShockTubeCOutput_0.vtu) has CellData "temp" and "temp2".
Both of them works fine with Paraview, if read-in separately.

==== Issue ====
I then have a pvtu file to combine them, (combined_0.pvtu), which has
PointData "stress" and CellData "temp". Paraview displays this combined
file well with "stree" and "temp" loaded in. Since CellData "temp" does not
exist in the HeatConductionCOuput_0 piece, I expected Paraview should treat
them as "zeros". However, Paraview sometimes gives random non-zero values
on this piece (please see attachment).

==== Questions ====
1) Is my pvtu file wrong?
2) Is it a bug in Paraview to show random non-zero values?
3) How should I fix this issue?

Best,

Ling

It helps some but the large mesh 4Million mesh points seem too large 
using a mono processor. I switched to a parallel PV mpi with 32 cores 
and it executes very fast.
Thanks for bring the immediate mode rendering to my attention,

The other thing that always causes dodgy flickering for me is when I am developing a custom filter/reader and somehow the bounding box of my data is corrupt (a single point with coordinates=stupid_number like 1Exxx is enough) this can cause clipping planes to misbehave - and the auto camera placement.

I suspect you'd have noticed already if that was your trouble.

Hi,

I wanted to setup a project that built VTK libraries using the modern vtk
module cmake code, added Python wrapping to the VTK libraries, and then
built a ParaView plugin that linked against the VTK libraries.

Traditionally, a ParaView plugin is created by compiling all the cxx files
into the plugin library, but I wanted my files compiled into a standard VTK
module library, and I wanted Python wrappers so that I could import my vtk
module library in Python.

Here's the example project.

https://github.com/patmarion/PythonWrappedPluginExample


It works, I tested it on ParaView master, but I had to comment out some
lines in ParaViewPlugins.cmake to avoid configure errors.  If a someone who
knows the pv_setup_module_environment() macro wants to give this a shot and
see why it doesn't work, please let me know!  *It seems that
pv_setup_module_environment() is broken:*

CMake Error at ParaView/VTK/CMake/vtkModuleAPI.cmake:44 (message):
  No such module: "AutobahnPython"
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  ParaView/CMake/ParaViewPlugins.cmake:1300 (vtk_module_load)
  Module/CMakeLists.txt:2 (pv_setup_module_environment)


I had to comment out a foreach loop to make it configure:

diff --git a/CMake/ParaViewPlugins.cmake b/CMake/ParaViewPlugins.cmake
index dcf53f9..12b139e 100644
--- a/CMake/ParaViewPlugins.cmake

Subject: [Paraview] Sequential sources with Programmable Source
Message-ID: <746960D7-2F1D-40B0-988F-E53C5D9F06E5@mac.com>

Hi all,


I'm trying to generate some sources with programmable sources
like this tutorial:
<http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Python_Programmable_Filter#Generating_Data_.28Programmable_Source.29>

Now I'd like to generate sequential sources for animations,
but there are no information how to define sources and time values.

Any idea?

I am thinking the problem is stemming from the non-traditional module
"AutobahnPython". It doesn't generate the module cmake file. That
needs to be fixed. In the mean time, you can try retry the same by
turning off PARAVIEW_ENABLE_WEB cmake flag, and verify.

Yup, something's definitely broken. The pv_setup_module_environment()
was written while VTK modules logic we still being revised so things
may have changed. I'll give it a look.

Subject: [Paraview] Saving multi-block data with names
Message-ID: <CAM5bWJeao1OrDsJ9AWFrVKi8Wb6uNoBXcG1td3DjxbJtMuO8Dg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, I have an EnSight file that I read into Paraview which comes in as
multi-block data.  When I apply an extractBlock filter, the names of the
different regions of my model show up to be extracted.  After extracting a
subset of the data, I save the data as a new *.vtm file.  However the
newFile.vtm, when read into Paraview does not have the names of the
regions.  Is there a way to preserve block names when saving data out of
Paraview?

Thanks in advance,

Subject: [Paraview] Disappearing of view
Message-ID: <CA+ze5C6oWGeCP+Hyk93EO2ROPJADA0Ebinxae12Ot9o41o5Dag@mail.gmail.com>

hi all,

I am showing my model using Paraview.
I have a filter ISOVolume.

The problem is the result of this filter which is a threshold on the data
goes invisible on the display view and it just shows when I click and drag
the model.

My model and other files in the same DisplayView  are ok and showing on the
Display View and it is just result of this filter which disappears.

The case is it disappears but actually exists there and if I click and hold
the mouse button it shows, but  When I release the mouse button, it goes
invisible again.

I had this problem when trying to create a mesh from a CSV file containing
x,y,z coordinates in another model as well.

Could anybody please tell me how to fix this problem?

Thanks in Advance

Try turning off display lists by checking the "Use Immediate Mode

Subject: [Paraview] AttributeError ising Python programmable filter
Message-ID: <1373488547.4334.YahooMailNeo@web186105.mail.ir2.yahoo.com>

Hello,

I'm using ParaView 4.01 32 bit and trying out an example Python programmable filter, however it seems I am unable to use some VTK methods and get the resulting errors:

Traceback (most recent call last):
File "<string>", line 21, in <module>
File "<string>", line 7, in RequestData
AttributeError: SetInput

Here is the example taken from the wiki that produces this error

pinput = vtk.vtkImageData()
pinput.SetExtent(0, 10, 0, 10, 0, 10)
pinput.SetOrigin(0, 1, 0)
pinput.SetSpacing(0.5, 0.5, 0.5)
probe = vtk.vtkProbeFilter()
probe.SetInput(pinput)
input_copy = inputs[0].NewInstance()
input_copy.UnRegister(None)
input_copy.ShallowCopy(inputs[0].VTKObject)
probe.SetSource(input_copy)
probe.Update()
output.ShallowCopy(probe.GetOutput())

The other filters on the wiki that don't use include the use of VTK filters work fine, e.g. the script called "transform the input" works just fine.? Does anyone know what I'm missing?

Change that to SetInputData.
The API for connecting filters to filters and filter to data differentiated
like so in VTK6
filter->filter SetInput < 6.0 > SetInputConnection
data->filter SetInput < 6.0 > SetInputData

Subject: [Paraview] How to indicate the pressure contour
Message-ID: <635392.58235.qm@web100917.mail.kks.yahoo.co.jp>

Hi?
I use LS-DYNA to analyze a shock wave.
I want to obseved the behavior of the shock wave to use paraview.
Now I am in trouble because pressure contour can be indicated in paraview.
The acceleration and velocity which is generated by the shock wave can be indicated in paraview.
In LS-Prepost, pressure contour can be observed.
At http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView:FAQ, [ Paraview can load d3plot files.] is written below.
What should I do to indicated pressure contour in paraview ??
Please tell me.

Thanks and regards.

Subject: [Paraview] Programmable filter: Get clip box size
Message-ID: <1373579594.76833.YahooMailNeo@web186104.mail.ir2.yahoo.com>

Hello,

I have a 3D image loaded and then I use a clip filter in box mode to segment the image.? I am trying to print out the size of the box but am only able to print out the bounds.? Here is my code:
input = self.GetInputDataObject(0,0)

if input.IsA("vtkMultiBlockDataSet"):
?    iter = input.NewIterator()
?    iter.UnRegister(None)
?    iter.InitTraversal()
?    while not iter.IsDoneWithTraversal():
??        curInput = iter.GetCurrentDataObject()
??        bounds = curInput.GetBounds()
??        print bounds
??        iter.GoToNextItem()

This correctly displays the bounds, however how do I access the actual size of the clip box itself?? I tried printing out curInput and cannot see any information about the size of the box.? Do I have to access this using GetInformation or some other method?

Thanks,
John

Hello,

Can someone explain to me (with my home made plugin)  the order of the 
pipeline execution in ParaView (4.0.1 git version in Linux 64bits)

When I create the plugin in the pipeline the following fuctions are 
executed :

FillInputPortInformation
RequestDataObject
FillOutputPortInformation
RequestInformation
RequestDataObject
RequestInformation

this function are called after the apply button is pressed.

RequestDataObject
RequestInformation
RequestDataObject
RequestInformation
RequestData
GenerateOutput

Why some function are executed 2 times ??

Thanks

I have a series of snapshots saved from a discrete element simulation in which each snapshot contains positions and some attributes for a set of discrete particles.  Is there a way to visualize the series of snapshots together to show each particle by connecting the positions over time to create a single streamline representation for each particle?

Hi Chris,

You can create manually a PolyLine, that growths according to the timestep.

Hi Matt,


I had same problems as yours.
So I coded Python scripts as below:
  1. Get the blocks' names with
     [source].GetDataInformation().GetCompositeDataInformation().GetName()
  2. Read the old *.vtm file with xml.etree.ElementTree.
  3. Add the blocks' names to the 'name' properties of 'DataSet' elements.
  4. Export the modified XML Tree as new *.vtm file.

Subject: [Paraview] Colour bar and scale missaligned
Message-ID: <DUB116-W3162580A217400E0217CA4D9660@phx.gbl>

Hello,

I'm using 4.0.1 64 bit on Windows 7. When I limit the number of discrete contours there is a misalignment of the scale and the colours in the colour bar. I've attached a plot and a state file that demonstrate the issue; a simple plane coloured by x-coordinate with the colour bar aligned above the plane to show the missalignment.

Is this an issue with my specific set up (graphics drivers ...) or do others see it too?

Thanks for your time,

Bob

Message-ID: <3DF7AAD42AB51F4ABC7FF1D14C62110647963202@EXDB4.ug.kth.se>

Hi,

I have data in hdf5 files which I want to process with Paraview, so I wrote an xdmf file that describes the data. I have compiled paraview 4.0.1 with MPI on a linux cluster, and paraview with Qt on windows which I use as client.

My data displays properly in the client, but since it is quite large I would like to read/process it in parallel.
However, if I color by ProcessId (either the filter or the vtkProcessId) I see that all the data is given by a single process. I believe that everything is set up properly since if I create a sphere source and apply the same filter, I can indeed see several colors. The structure of the xdmf file is as follows:

After much searching it seems that one has to use Spatial collections for paraview to deal with the data in parallel. Indeed with something like:

<Xdmf>

                                <Grid Name="Channel" GridType="Collection" CollectionType="Temporal">

                                                                                <Topology ... *Contains a fraction of the cells* />

                                                                                <Attribute ... />

                                                                <Grid Name="G1 at 0s" GridType="Uniform" >

                </Domain>
</Xdmf>


Paraview assigns 1 process per  sub-mesh G0, G1, ... in the spatial collection. The problem is that all these G0, G1, etc. don't appear to be connected, and when using filters like Cell Data to Point Data, contours etc., there is a discontinuity that is clearly visible between each part of the mesh so I don't think that is the way to go. Or am I missing something? What is the usual way to get parallel processing of xdmf files?

Any help would be greatly appreciated,

Romain

Subject: [Paraview] Programmable filter: Use of VTK filter classes
Message-ID: <1373892589.31135.YahooMailNeo@web186106.mail.ir2.yahoo.com>

Hello,
?
I'm using Paraview on 4.0.1.? I was under the impression that it would be possible to use some of the many VTK filters from a Python programmable filter, however I seem to only be able to instansiate some of the filters, for others I get the message:
?
Traceback (most recent call last): 
File "<string>", line 21, in <module>
File "<string>", line 4, in RequestData
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'vtkSelectEnclosedPoints'
?
from the following line of code:
?
v?= vtk.vtkSelectEnclosedPoints()
?
Is?it possible to use something like vtkSelectEnclosedPoints from a programmable filter?
?
Thanks,
John

ParaView by default only imports a minimal subset of VTK. You can
explicitly import a particular fmodule from VTK as follows:

> from paraview.vtk import vtkFiltersModeling
> v = vtkFiltersModeling.vtkSelectEnclosedPoints()

Try turning on "Compute Scalars" in the Properties panel for the
"Contour" filter.

Subject: [Paraview] Import Tecplot Line Chart file not showing the data
Message-ID: <CACd0G9wDvn3eOqLPMuiPM6-w97K6gxdJNAcFJD0beCV4o52sow@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm new to Paraview and I'm trying to plot some tecplot XY files that
worked ok on Tecplot. In Paraview the files are imported without errors but
no data is shown on Display, and so I can't generate a XY plot from Line
Chart. The information tab shows on Statistics NA for all fields, and
trying to see the data in a Layout with spreadsheet view is empty.

The headers and a few columns from the file are below:

title = "dataset benzene"
variables = "x", "y",
"z","h+1","na+1","ca+2","cl-1","co3-2","c6h6","o2(aq)","c5h7o2n","c5h7o2n(d)","oh-","h2co3aq","hco3-","caoh+","caco3aq","cacl+","cahco3+"
zone t = "C_j, X_i, initial", i =  101, j =    1, k =    1,  f=point

I just tried to replicate on a recent git pull and I was not able to. It 
may be fixed. but I'd like to confirm that the scalar bar widget has 
been a bit flaky lately.

One thing I'd like to point out about your screen shot is the use of too 
many different font sizes in the lables. Your examples only has 2 sizes, 
but I've seen examples with 3. This makes the color bar unusable for me. 
I end up generating my own in a post processing step for this reason.

it would be really nice to have a simple nice looking scalar bar for 
plots. A single font size is a key feature. Also I like to see all of 
the labels on one side, and evenly spaced. The logic for deciding on 
which side of the widget seems to be easily confused and I've seen some 
crazy looking results.

Simple is better. Here is an example(made by my post processing script) 
of how this looks

Thanks Burlen,

I'll try the nightly build (if that's what 'git pull' is?). Your scalar bar does indeed look just right; would you be willing to share the script code? I've noticed another ugly quirk with the new default scalar bar, the number format applies to all values except the limits, so there seems to be no way of suppressing a limit value from being displayed as 0.10000000000001 (for example).

Regards,

Bob

Thanks, Robert. I have been working with Suzanne on this issue. The line in vtkConfigure.h is:
#define VTK_CONST_REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON

We changed it to be 
#define VTK_CONST_REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON 1
but after reconfiguring and regenerating, the line changes back to the original "#define VTK_CONST_REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON"

Because of this, rebuilding ParaView on Titan with pgi compiler generates the same error. 

Any further suggestions on this issue?

Thanks,
Hong

Hi Bob,

I can share the collection of gimp/bash scripts but I have to warn you 
they're more than a little rough around the edges as these were 
originally only intended for my use. YMMV! https://github.com/burlen/SciGIMP

here's how you'd use my "sq-axes" script to add the scale onto the body 
of the LUT I saved from PV(attached).

f=lut-for-curl-ue.png; sq-axes.sh $f axes-$f 0.0045 0.163 7 11 1 0 1 0 
11 1 0.05 1.0 0.03 0.6 3 12 b ff "|\xE2\x88\x87\xE2\xA8\xAFUe|" "" 26 b 
ff "" 16 b ff; display axes-$f

I've never tested it but in theory it should work in windows (from 
cygwin shell) too.

Hello Burlen,

That was very kind of you to share your scripts. I fear you may be casting pearls before a swine, but I will attempt to run them on my PC. The plots are very impressive; van Gogh meets Munch at Sheldon Cooper's flat. I'll send you a picture if I have some success.

Thanks and regards,

Bob

arrange the data, I'd like to force the data panel to have aspect ratio
16:9 as well. Is this possible in ParaView?

Message-ID: <000601ce81e9$d060f020$7122d060$@tu-cottbus.de>

Hello,

when I use ParaView in CAVE mode with more complex models / visualizations
it often happens, that pipeline updates block the whole application. This
freezes the displayed images on the screen which is very bad in a
head-tracked environment, where the image needs to be updated around 60
times per second. 

Now, I found this post
http://public.kitware.com/pipermail/arb/2010-May/000094.html and the related
bug report http://www.vtk.org/Bug/view.php?id=9983. I guess that this
feature would overcome the blocking pipeline updates in the CAVE mode.
Unfortunately, this bug has been expired. Are there any plans to re-open it.
I would really appreciate it...

Best regards,
Stephan

Hi,

I have observed a strange behavior: When I select points in a 3D dataset, the selection marks are not always drawn onto the points. When I rotate the geometry, they seem to move to different locations. When I turn the Point Labels on, they remain next to the selected points, whereas the selection marks seem to change location.
This seems like a bug to me. Is it known, is there a fix/workaround?

I am under Windows 7, I see the behavior with Version 4.0.1 64-bit and 3.12.0-RC2 32-bit.

Matthias

Subject: [Paraview] Importing all vtk modules with ParaView
Message-ID: <CAMetC=SexH3nYH0jCVvhMuEHpt5iCmZmZO0iVyCjSabnk42KoQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I think that ParaView's python package should provide a mechanism to import
all vtk modules.  The site-packages/paraview/vtk directory includes .py
files for each vtk module, but the __init__.py file only imports a subset
of them.  As far as I can tell, it's up to the user to import individual
modules by name.

Here's a code snippet that inspects the site-packages/paraview/vtk
directory and imports all vtk*.py files.


import os
import glob

try:
    # this works for vtkpython
    from vtk import *

except ImportError:

    # this works for pvpython
    import paraview.vtk
    baseDir = os.path.dirname(paraview.vtk.__file__)
    for f in glob.glob(os.path.join(baseDir, 'vtk*.py')):
        moduleName = os.path.splitext(os.path.basename(f))[0]
        exec('from paraview.vtk.%s import *' % moduleName)


I usually put this code into a file named vtkAll.py and then my scripts can
do:

import vtkAll as vtk

And that will work with vtkpython and pvpython.

I don't think there is a way to fix the aspect ratio, but you can fix
the view size to a given number of pixels with the "Lock View Size
Custom" under the "Tools" menu.

Just a supplemental note to the previous message below: if I don't run ccmake to reconfigure and regenerate, and directly run "make" after changing the line to "#define VTK_CONST_REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON 1" the same error/issue still remains. Looks like this VTK_CONST_REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON, although defined in the vtkConfigure.h, is not honored by the pgi compiler on Titan. Any suggestions/workarounds to get around this issue?

Thanks,
Hong

Thanks, Robert. I have been working with Suzanne on this issue. The line in vtkConfigure.h is:
#define VTK_CONST_REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON

We changed it to be
#define VTK_CONST_REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON 1 but after reconfiguring and regenerating, the line changes back to the original "#define VTK_CONST_REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON"

Because of this, rebuilding ParaView on Titan with pgi compiler generates the same error. 

Any further suggestions on this issue?

Thanks,
Hong

We have seen this issue with const_reverse_iterators before on older versions of gcc. What is the value of VTK_CONST_REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON in the build directory file Common/Core/vtkConfigure.h?

Subject: [Paraview] Animation with pvbatch
Message-ID: <51E5A2E4.7000207@gmx.net>

Hello,

I am trying to produce an animated series of images with pvbatch and the 
scriptbelow. The pvsm fileloads a pvd file with a time series and 
applies a number of filters.
When executed in the Paraview GUI (version 4.0.1) via Tools->Python 
Shell->Run Script, it successfully steps through the animation.

Whenrun with pvbatch, I see the correct output of "print AN.EndTime" 
(2999- the same number as when run in the GUI), but AN.GoToNext() 
apparently does nothing and the loop immediately terminates after one 
step with newtime==oldtime==0.0. What am I doing wrong?
I browsed through numerous examples for animation with pvbatch but none 
of them did really fit (most of them are rather old or use 
AnimateReader() which does not seem to be appropriate here).
Do you have a suggestions?

Thanks in advance,

Mathias

Subject: [Paraview] Integration of a 3d space onto a plane?
Message-ID: <9047EE0D4D3C8E43B93980DA10A0738086409974@EXMB04.srn.sandia.gov>

I have a user that has a 3d object, with variables in this 3d space.  For instance, a cube, with a variable (say temperature) at a high in the center of the sphere, and a low at the corners.  This user wants to look down one axis (say the X axis), and sum or integrate all of the variables from the 3d space onto the 2d plane the cube is sitting on.  This will produce a 2d surface with the max in the center, and min at the corners.

Is this possible in ParaView?  It sounds like a fairly high priority task.

Thanks,

Alan

Hi Alan,

I was working on a filter that was similar to this. If I remember correctly
it could handle both vtkRectilinearGrids and vtkImageDatas (it definitely
couldn't handle vtkStructuredGrids, vtkPolyDatas or vtkUnstructuredGrids).
It also worked in parallel (or was supposed to). I never quite put the
finishing touches on it but if this is a high priority I can revisit it or
share it and let someone else push it forward.

Dear all,

Finally, I found a solution for my problem. A working example script is 
given below: I am now reading the TimestepValues from my data source and 
setting ANI.AnimationTime and (!) VIEW.ViewTime appropriately.
Still I do not know why GoToNext() etc. do not work from pvbatch. - Are 
they only applicable for the ParaView GUI?

Thanks Andy - you (and Kitware) are the greatest.

It is unstructured.  Thus, I believe your filter isn't a solution for me.

Thanks,

Hi Alan,

I was working on a filter that was similar to this. If I remember correctly it could handle both vtkRectilinearGrids and vtkImageDatas (it definitely couldn't handle vtkStructuredGrids, vtkPolyDatas or vtkUnstructuredGrids). It also worked in parallel (or was supposed to). I never quite put the finishing touches on it but if this is a high priority I can revisit it or share it and let someone else push it forward.

This will produce a 2d surface with the max in the center, and min at the corners.

Is this possible in ParaView?  It sounds like a fairly high priority task.

Thanks,

Hi Mathias,

I recently created the following script to do an animation. Hard coded 
number of time steps, but shouldn't be hard to get the begin/end etc. 
The python program is at the bottom of the page.

Famous last words, this worked for me 8-)

Message-ID: <0EB9B6375711A04B820E6B6F5CCA9F681732D67E@MBX210.d.ethz.ch>

Hello

I am configuring a new cluster with two GPUs per node. When doing server-side rendering, I get the following dirty pixels when I increase pixels resolution beyond a certain threshold. this is using a single GPU per node with a command like

mpiexec -n 8 -env DISPLAY :0.0 /apps/castor/ParaView/4.0/bin/pvserver -rc -ch=148.***.***.*** -sp=11111

my PV is compiled with ICET_USE_OPENGL:BOOL=ON. What could cause these dirty pixels? my driver is libGL.so.319.17

Second problem: I'd really like to use both GPUs. I run (for example)

mpiexec -n 8 -env DISPLAY :0.0 /apps/castor/ParaView/4.0/bin/pvserver -rc -ch=148.***.***.*** -sp=11111 :  -n 8 -env DISPLAY :0.1 /apps/castor/ParaView/4.0/bin/pvserver -rc -ch=148.***.***.*** -sp=11111

and the whole thing crashes right on init with 

ERROR: In /apps/eiger/src/ParaView-v4.0.1-source/VTK/Parallel/Core/vtkSocketCommunicator.cxx, line 812
vtkSocketCommunicator (0x200d5f390): Could not receive tag. 144432 

I have search the ML and the wiki, but most messages refer to tiled displays, wheras I just want to distribute GPUs over pvservers. What have I forgotten? I am running 4.0.1.

Hi Jean,

The dirty pixels might caused if you're exceeding the max screen size a 
configured in your server's xorg.conf. That's one way I've seen that 
before. You could run xrandr command to list the available resolutions.

Not sure about 2, but I've used PV 4.0.1 on an system that has 2 gpu's 
per node. similar to what you've done. I'm assuming you have an x screen 
for each gpu. are you able to run some other x program per gpu? if yes 
could you get a stack trace?

Well, with an unstructured grid a quick and dirty possible solution would
be to:
1) have the user specify a grid to project the solution onto using the
Plane source
2) For each point in the Plane source, do something like the plot over line
3) Then do an integration over that.

You've probably already thought of something better but that's my 2 cents
worth.

Good luck,
Andy

  I need that for a script which reads a massive multiprocessor data,

I would like to animate x-slices of the  same calculation (x= 0.1, ...)

In earlier versions one could specify how many slices desired and the

In the linux  64-bit PV 4.01binaries, there is no advanced properties 
option in the icon .
However, it permits to do multiple slices over a range, works.
However the range in the PV file is -15 to 15 but the  range in the icon 
-s -21.2 to 21.2. Thus
The 12 planes that I requested are not correctly spaced.

How do I animate the planes, 1 plane at  time?
Thanks,

Message-ID: <CACd0G9zNUAEK1189t-z9iHgss5KZHH7Fud0-jSoKA0e_LyTdNg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm still struggling with Paraview to read files in Tecplot format. I'm
using some examples from this site:

http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/tec/tec.html

The 3D examples are read correctly in Paraview, but the examples

http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/tec/simpxy.dat

and

http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/tec/simpxy2.dat

are read but can't be plotted. All the statistics are N/A (Type, Number of
Cells, Number of Points), no bounds are recognized, and the Spreadsheet
view is empty. Is this a bug?

Cheers

Subject: [Paraview] new property panel, widget order question
Message-ID: <51E7A3C0.4000903@ec-nantes.fr>

I change my plugin to the new property panel architecture. Very nice, 
now I can reuse  some of the code that control the widgets in my other 
filters.

But, (there is always a but)...

A have a base class  ("Base" derived from vtkAlgorithm), with his own 
server_manager_xml file.

Now I have my final class ("Final") derived from Base. Of course this 
class has his own server_manager_xml ( using the base_proxygroup, 
base_proxyname tags for proper configuration).

My problem is that at the end of this file I use the PropertyGroup to 
group the widgets but this not work. Example:
in the server_manager_xml (of the final class)
...
<PropertyGroup label="Main">
        <Property name="PointArrayStatus" />     <------ this came from 
Final
        <Property name="VisualizationSpaceStatus" /> <------ this came 
from Base
</PropertyGroup>
<PropertyGroup label="Options">
        <Property name="Refresh" />                                      
<------ this came from Base
        <Property name="ComputeDerivatives" />      <------ this came 
from Base
</PropertyGroup>
...

Inside ParaView the panel has the following order :
[- Properties]
_Main _
   VisualizationSpaceStatus
_Options _
   Refresh
   ComputeDerivatives
_Main
_  PointArrayStatus
[- Display]
...

I think paraview expose all the base class widgets first and only then 
expose the final class widgets.

Can I change this behaviour to correctly order my widgets???

Thanks to all
Felipe

Subject: [Paraview] Difference between the my animation view and the result
	animation video
Message-ID: <CANj=5vhojKG+j5ANjRUFW5B7ccc7NjPifmPCc95UvLyKmBMMiQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

 I'm working with the last version of paraview and this is the first time i
use this softwrare.
I'm creating an animation of a 3D model and I use the following settings:
- camera orbit
- real time
I set my camera path, focus and everything according to what I see in the
animation view so when I play my animation it displays exactly how I want
it to be.
But when I render my animation and save it as an avi format video, the
resulted video doesn't look exactly as the animation in paraview, things
seem to be bigger in the renderred video.
So I wanted to know if someone knows why it happens or is it normal?

I know that with other softwares such as 3DSMax I have 2 types of view :
the normal view and the renderred video view displayed in 2 independant
frames. So when I render the animation, things appear exactly as in the
renderred video view.

I don't know if the renderred video view exists in paraview or I will
always need to guess how the renderred video will look like.

Thank for your replies and your help.

Fenitra.

Hello.

Paraview is a 3D software that is always expecting a mesh (surface or 
volume) with the three X, Y, Z variables for points coordinates. Your 
simpxy.dat file has only two data variables (Distance and Temperature), 
that is why it cannot build points and cells and shows N/A (Not 
available). Try to add coordinates of a grid to your file, and you 
should be able to plot Temperature against Distance.

Hello Richard,

Thanks for your answer. Indeed, if I modify the file to

TITLE = "Example: Simple XY Plot"

0.0   0.0   0.0   0.0       850.9

0.0   0.0   0.0   0.35      599.9
0.0   0.0   0.0   0.4454    600.0
0.0   0.0   0.0   0.49      513.0
0.0   0.0   0.0   0.5656    442.0
0.0   0.0   0.0   0.6423    333.5
0.0   0.0   0.0   0.6604    300.4

0.0   0.0   0.0   1.3       200.0

Paraview can read the file. But this poses a new problem: if I use J=1,
K=1, Paraview cannot read it again, but if I use J=2, K=1 or vice versa
Paraview can read it, but it shows the 20 values plus 20 zeros after it. Is
there a way to go around this?

Cheers

Hello.

If you are using I=20, J=2 and K=1, you should have 20x2x1=40 points in 
your mesh (it is a surface), so you should have 40 lines after the ZONE 
line. Paraview finds only 20 lines and assumes zero for the 20 missing 
values. So you have to repeat your 20 data lines at the end of your file.

Also, you should not have all X,Y,Z variables to zero because Paraview 
cannot display the mesh. For instance, you may define a surface grid 
assuming X=Distance for all your data. Then you should have Y=0 for the 
first 20 data lines, and Y=non zero constant for the next 20 data lines 
while keeping same X, Distance and Temperature values as in the first 20 
lines. The variable Z may be kept to zero for all lines. Thus, your mesh 
will look like a rectangle.

Alas, this is working as it was designed for. Group "labels" are not
treated as unique keys. Every time a distinct group is found it gets
added to the panel. We could add a mechanism to add group "names" and
keep them unique and merge properties together, but that would need
some coding.

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView Catalyst User's Guide version 1.0
Message-ID: <CAMaOp+Fo_2HjaS00NLcP32ASEx_X=3bxng0ZHXE_zh=M9xVetA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm pleased to include the first official version of the ParaView Catalyst
User's Guide. ParaView Catalyst is meant to be linked with simulation codes
to provide a general *in situ *analysis and visualization capability*. *It
has the potential to drastically reduce the time simulation users take to
gain insight into their problems. It does this by computing the desired
quantities while a simulation code runs and can significantly reduce the
amount of simulation data that needs to be written to disk.

The user's guide is divided into three main sections:
1) User's section intended for simulation users to utilize Catalyst
co-processing with their simulation runs
2) Developer's section intended for simulation code developers to
instrument their code to work with Catalyst
3) Installer's section for the people responsible for building Catalyst and
linking with a simulation code.

There is also a github repository that contains examples at
https://github.com/acbauer/CatalystExampleCode. This is mainly targeted
towards developers to understand how to instrument their code with Catalyst.

Regards,
Andy

Subject: [Paraview] How to stop ParaView from triangulating imported cells
Message-ID: <20130718191736.63b46840@ailurus>

Hi,

I'm wondering how to prevent ParaView from (visually) triangulating the imported cells. To illustrate the problem, I attached a minimal example (2.3 kB) to this email. It contains a heavily discretized version of a parametric surface, consisting of 20 cells (quads). 

These quads are in fact non-planar, so I understand why ParaView triangulates them for plotting purposes. However, when I export the scene as an .x3d file, it actually exports the triangles instead of the quads.

Two questions:
- Is it possible to display the edges of the actual cells (i.e. the quads) in ParaView (i.e. in 'WireFrame' mode or in 'Surface with Edges' mode)
- Is it possible to export the actual cells instead of these triangles

Best regards,
Pieter

I did an experiment to use pgi compiler to compile a simple program test.cpp like the following:
-----------------------
#include <vector>
int main()
{
  std::vector<int> test;
  std::vector<int>::const_reverse_iterator it = test.rbegin();
  it != test.rend();
  return 0;
}
-------------------------
by running "pgCC test.cpp -o test" then I got the same error below:
--------------------------
"test.cpp", line 6: error: no operator "!=" matches these operands
            operand types are: std::reverse_iterator<const int *> !=
                      std::reverse_iterator<int *>
    it != test.rend();
       ^
--------------------------

So I think the pgi compiler included in PrgEnv-pgi/4.1.40 module I am currently using on Titan does not support REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON. My question is whether VTK/ParaView somehow accommodates this and has logic to get around using this REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON when the variable VTK_CONST_REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON is not defined. I did try and undefined VTK_CONST_REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON, but the same error remains. I checked the file VTK/Rendering/Context2D/vtkAbstractContextItem.cxx where the error is raised and did not find any logic to handle the case where VTK_CONST_REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON is not defined. Does this mean ParaView cannot be built using a compiler that does not support REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON?

Thanks,
Hong

Just a supplemental note to the previous message below: if I don't run ccmake to reconfigure and regenerate, and directly run "make" after changing the line to "#define VTK_CONST_REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON 1" the same error/issue still remains. Looks like this VTK_CONST_REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON, although defined in the vtkConfigure.h, is not honored by the pgi compiler on Titan. Any suggestions/workarounds to get around this issue?

Thanks,

Thanks, Robert. I have been working with Suzanne on this issue. The line in vtkConfigure.h is:
#define VTK_CONST_REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON

We changed it to be
#define VTK_CONST_REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON 1 but after reconfiguring and regenerating, the line changes back to the original "#define VTK_CONST_REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON"

Because of this, rebuilding ParaView on Titan with pgi compiler generates the same error.

Any further suggestions on this issue?

Thanks,
Hong

We have seen this issue with const_reverse_iterators before on older versions of gcc. What is the value of VTK_CONST_REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON in the build directory file Common/Core/vtkConfigure.h?

So I misread the header that parses
VTK_CONST_REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON. If
VTK_CONST_REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON is set, we are stating that
compiler
DOES support const_reverse_iterator comparison, if it is not set the
compiler doesn't.

I expect due to cross compilation the
VTK_CONST_REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON is being defined in your case,
while you actually want it not defined.

VTK can be used with compilers like pgi that have a broken
const_reverse_iterator implementation.

Thanks, Robert. It is good to know that VTK can be used with compilers that do not support const_reverse_iterator. I did try and commented out VTK_CONST_REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON definition in vtkConfigure.h. In fact, I changed the CMakeList.txt in ParaView_Source_Dir/VTK to have it off, so after I reconfigured and regenerated paraview, VTK_CONST_REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON definition line is commented out in vtkConfigure.h. So I assume this means VTK_CONST_REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON is not defined. However, the same error got raised in the same reverse iterator operations in vtkAbstractContextItem.cxx. Without understanding how VTK works internally to honor this VTK_CONST_REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON definition, I am thinking those same reverse iterator operations in vtkAbstractContextItem.cxx should not be called if VTK_CONST_REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON is not defined in this case. Could you shed some lights on this?

Thanks,
Hong

So I misread the header that parses
VTK_CONST_REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON. If VTK_CONST_REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON is set, we are stating that compiler DOES support const_reverse_iterator comparison, if it is not set the compiler doesn't.

I expect due to cross compilation the
VTK_CONST_REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON is being defined in your case, while you actually want it not defined.

VTK can be used with compilers like pgi that have a broken const_reverse_iterator implementation.

My question is whether VTK/ParaView somehow accommodates this and has logic to get around using this REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON when the variable VTK_CONST_REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON is not defined. I did try and undefined VTK_CONST_REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON, but the same error remains. I checked the file VTK/Rendering/Context2D/vtkAbstractContextItem.cxx where the error is raised and did not find any logic to handle the case where VTK_CONST_REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON is not defined. Does this mean ParaView cannot be built using a compiler that does not support REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON?

vtkContextScenePrivate.h looks at VTK_CONST_REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON.

If VTK_CONST_REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON is defined we set
vtkContextScenePrivate::const_reverse_iterator to be a:
  std::vector<vtkAbstractContextItem*>::const_reverse_iterator.

If VTK_CONST_REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON is not defined we set
vtkContextScenePrivate::const_reverse_iterator to be a:
 std::vector<vtkAbstractContextItem*>::reverse_iterator.

When you make sure that VTK_CONST_REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON is not
defined what is the error message you are getting?

After VTK_CONST_REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON is undefined, I got the following error:
----------------------------------
"/ccs/proj/nfi010/ParaView/ParaView-3.98.1-source/VTK/Rendering/Context2D/vtkAbstractContextItem.cxx", line 167: error: 
          no operator "!=" matches these operands
            operand types are: vtkAbstractContextItem * !=
                      std::reverse_iterator<vtkAbstractContextItem **>
        this->Children->rbegin(); *it != this->Children->rend(); ++it)
                                      ^
-----------------------------------

so now it complains about reverse_iterator as well. Then I modified my test.cpp to replace const_reverse_iterator with reverse_iterator, this time it compiles successfully with the same pgi compiler. Now I am really puzzled. It looks like pgi compiler works with reverse_iterator, but why it complains on reverse_iterator as well when I built ParaVIew with VTK_CONST_REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON undefined? Any idea or explanation on this?

Thanks,
Hong

vtkContextScenePrivate.h looks at VTK_CONST_REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON.

If VTK_CONST_REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON is defined we set
vtkContextScenePrivate::const_reverse_iterator to be a:
  std::vector<vtkAbstractContextItem*>::const_reverse_iterator.

If VTK_CONST_REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON is not defined we set
vtkContextScenePrivate::const_reverse_iterator to be a:
 std::vector<vtkAbstractContextItem*>::reverse_iterator.

When you make sure that VTK_CONST_REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON is not
defined what is the error message you are getting?

I did try and commented out VTK_CONST_REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON definition in vtkConfigure.h. In fact, I changed the CMakeList.txt in ParaView_Source_Dir/VTK to have it off, so after I reconfigured and regenerated paraview, VTK_CONST_REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON definition line is commented out in vtkConfigure.h. So I assume this means VTK_CONST_REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON is not defined. However, the same error got raised in the same reverse iterator operations in vtkAbstractContextItem.cxx. Without understanding how VTK works internally to honor this VTK_CONST_REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON definition, I am thinking those same reverse iterator operations in vtkAbstractContextItem.cxx should not be called if VTK_CONST_REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON is not defined in this case. Could you shed some lights on this?

My question is whether VTK/ParaView somehow accommodates this and has logic to get around using this REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON when the variable VTK_CONST_REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON is not defined. I did try and undefined VTK_CONST_REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON, but the same error remains.

Does this mean ParaView cannot be built using a compiler that does not support REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON?

Are you sure you have no modifications to vtkContextScenePrivate.h or
vtkAbstractContextItem? I believe this->Children should be a
std::reverse_iterator<vtkAbstractContextItem *> not
std::reverse_iterator<vtkAbstractContextItem **>

OK. On line 167 of vtkAbstractContextItem.cxx, the '*' before 'it' should be removed. That is, to replace " this->Children->rbegin(); *it != this->Children->rend(); ++it" with " this->Children->rbegin(); it != this->Children->rend(); ++it"
This looks like a bug to me, but it can build with gnu compilers, I guess pgi compiler is still more strict in this case. 

I am rebuilding ParaView after making this change. I am positive this is the caveat that generates the error after VTK_CONST_REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON is undefined.

Thanks,
Hong

Subject: Re: [Paraview] building paraview 3.98.1 with the pgi compiler (13.3.0-12.5.0)

After VTK_CONST_REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON is undefined, I got the following error:
----------------------------------
"/ccs/proj/nfi010/ParaView/ParaView-3.98.1-source/VTK/Rendering/Context2D/vtkAbstractContextItem.cxx", line 167: error: 
          no operator "!=" matches these operands
            operand types are: vtkAbstractContextItem * !=
                      std::reverse_iterator<vtkAbstractContextItem **>
        this->Children->rbegin(); *it != this->Children->rend(); ++it)
                                      ^
-----------------------------------

so now it complains about reverse_iterator as well. Then I modified my test.cpp to replace const_reverse_iterator with reverse_iterator, this time it compiles successfully with the same pgi compiler. Now I am really puzzled. It looks like pgi compiler works with reverse_iterator, but why it complains on reverse_iterator as well when I built ParaVIew with VTK_CONST_REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON undefined? Any idea or explanation on this?

Thanks,
Hong

vtkContextScenePrivate.h looks at VTK_CONST_REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON.

If VTK_CONST_REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON is defined we set vtkContextScenePrivate::const_reverse_iterator to be a:
  std::vector<vtkAbstractContextItem*>::const_reverse_iterator.

If VTK_CONST_REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON is not defined we set vtkContextScenePrivate::const_reverse_iterator to be a:
 std::vector<vtkAbstractContextItem*>::reverse_iterator.

When you make sure that VTK_CONST_REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON is not defined what is the error message you are getting?

I did try and commented out VTK_CONST_REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON definition in vtkConfigure.h. In fact, I changed the CMakeList.txt in ParaView_Source_Dir/VTK to have it off, so after I reconfigured and regenerated paraview, VTK_CONST_REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON definition line is commented out in vtkConfigure.h. So I assume this means VTK_CONST_REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON is not defined. However, the same error got raised in the same reverse iterator operations in vtkAbstractContextItem.cxx. Without understanding how VTK works internally to honor this VTK_CONST_REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON definition, I am thinking those same reverse iterator operations in vtkAbstractContextItem.cxx should not be called if VTK_CONST_REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON is not defined in this case. Could you shed some lights on this?

My question is whether VTK/ParaView somehow accommodates this and has logic to get around using this REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON when the variable VTK_CONST_REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON is not defined. I did try and undefined VTK_CONST_REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON, but the same error remains.

What version of paraview are you compiling? line 167 of
vtkAbstractContextItem.cxx has never contained "*it !=
this->Children->rend();". That looks to be an accidental modification
somebody made to your source tree when trying to fix this bug.

Just realized gnu compilers used const_reverse_iterator and did not have this "*it" problem as I noted below. Not sure how this "*it" is generated. I did not make any modifications to any other files. The only thing I did is to undefined VTK_CONST_REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON.

Thanks,
Hong

OK. On line 167 of vtkAbstractContextItem.cxx, the '*' before 'it' should be removed. That is, to replace " this->Children->rbegin(); *it != this->Children->rend(); ++it" with " this->Children->rbegin(); it != this->Children->rend(); ++it"
This looks like a bug to me, but it can build with gnu compilers, I guess pgi compiler is still more strict in this case. 

I am rebuilding ParaView after making this change. I am positive this is the caveat that generates the error after VTK_CONST_REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON is undefined.

Thanks,
Hong

Subject: Re: [Paraview] building paraview 3.98.1 with the pgi compiler (13.3.0-12.5.0)

After VTK_CONST_REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON is undefined, I got the following error:
----------------------------------
"/ccs/proj/nfi010/ParaView/ParaView-3.98.1-source/VTK/Rendering/Context2D/vtkAbstractContextItem.cxx", line 167: error: 
          no operator "!=" matches these operands
            operand types are: vtkAbstractContextItem * !=
                      std::reverse_iterator<vtkAbstractContextItem **>
        this->Children->rbegin(); *it != this->Children->rend(); ++it)
                                      ^
-----------------------------------

so now it complains about reverse_iterator as well. Then I modified my test.cpp to replace const_reverse_iterator with reverse_iterator, this time it compiles successfully with the same pgi compiler. Now I am really puzzled. It looks like pgi compiler works with reverse_iterator, but why it complains on reverse_iterator as well when I built ParaVIew with VTK_CONST_REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON undefined? Any idea or explanation on this?

Thanks,
Hong

vtkContextScenePrivate.h looks at VTK_CONST_REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON.

If VTK_CONST_REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON is defined we set vtkContextScenePrivate::const_reverse_iterator to be a:
  std::vector<vtkAbstractContextItem*>::const_reverse_iterator.

If VTK_CONST_REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON is not defined we set vtkContextScenePrivate::const_reverse_iterator to be a:
 std::vector<vtkAbstractContextItem*>::reverse_iterator.

When you make sure that VTK_CONST_REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON is not defined what is the error message you are getting?

My question is whether VTK/ParaView somehow accommodates this and has logic to get around using this REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON when the variable VTK_CONST_REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON is not defined. I did try and undefined VTK_CONST_REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON, but the same error remains. I checked the file VTK/Rendering/Context2D/vtkAbstractContextItem.cxx where the error is raised and did not find any logic to handle the case where VTK_CONST_REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON is not defined. Does this mean ParaView cannot be built using a compiler that does not support REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON?

It really doesn't matter, but no compiler will compile the comparison
of the dereferenced iterator to rend(). Somehow your local copy was
modified, as I can't find any mention of *it in any revision of that
file in git.

I did try and undefined VTK_CONST_REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON, but the same error remains. I checked the file VTK/Rendering/Context2D/vtkAbstractContextItem.cxx where the error is raised and did not find any logic to handle the case where VTK_CONST_REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON is not defined. Does this mean ParaView cannot be built using a compiler that does not support REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON?

Thanks, Robert. You are right, I just checked ParaView source on another machine and it does not include * on line 167. I am using version 3.98.1. I do work together with a Titan support specialist on this issue. Not sure how this * got in there, but it should be something on our side. Sorry for the wrong conclusion and thank you very much for your help and explanation which helped us to resolve this issue.

Thanks again,
Hong

What version of paraview are you compiling? line 167 of vtkAbstractContextItem.cxx has never contained "*it !=
this->Children->rend();". That looks to be an accidental modification
somebody made to your source tree when trying to fix this bug.

Then I modified my test.cpp to replace const_reverse_iterator with reverse_iterator, this time it compiles successfully with the same pgi compiler. Now I am really puzzled. It looks like pgi compiler works with reverse_iterator, but why it complains on reverse_iterator as well when I built ParaVIew with VTK_CONST_REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON undefined? Any idea or explanation on this?

I did try and commented out VTK_CONST_REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON definition in vtkConfigure.h. In fact, I changed the CMakeList.txt in ParaView_Source_Dir/VTK to have it off, so after I reconfigured and regenerated paraview, VTK_CONST_REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON definition line is commented out in vtkConfigure.h. So I assume this means VTK_CONST_REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON is not defined. However, the same error got raised in the same reverse iterator operations in vtkAbstractContextItem.cxx. Without understanding how VTK works internally to honor this VTK_CONST_REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON definition, I am thinking those same reverse iterator operations in vtkAbstractContextItem.cxx should not be called if VTK_CONST_REVERSE_ITERATOR_COMPARISON is not defined in this case. Could you shed some lights on this?

Hi,

interesting project. I use the FEM code Elmer (www.csc.fi/elmer), and I wonder if it would make sense to make it work with catalyst.
Question: I didn't find the User's Guide on the kitware website. Is is available somewhere so that I can give a pointer to the Elmer team, in case they are interested?

Subject: [Paraview] Time support fro multiple datasets
Message-ID: <51E91384.7010003@in.tum.de>

Dear Paraview-user and developers,
we have a simulation code , which produces two different outputs with 
different timestep information. The first output
we describe with hdf5 and second with pvd. We store information about 
the time in both formats (two different timescales). We
have currently problems with the time support. It is considering only 
one dataset and not the combination of both. What
can be done to fix this?
Regards,
A.Atanasov

Message-ID: <0EB9B6375711A04B820E6B6F5CCA9F681734953B@MBX210.d.ethz.ch>


I am running an interactive parallel viz session on a number of remote GPUs, with an EyeDome Lighting view. The view is created from the GUI panel. Works extremely well, and fast.

What about creating the view from python? I have a fully scripted animation, already working well, but is uses the standard 3D view. I cannot find information on how to ask for an EDL view. What is the syntax?

RenderViewWithEDL1 = CreateRenderView("missing parameters here?")  # or a different name altogether?

this is v4.0.1

TIA for any tip.

Hi Jean,

the "missing parameters here?" should be RenderViewWithEDF.

This is basically the name of the proxy in the XML definition.

ServerManagerConfiguration>

  <ProxyGroup name="views">

    <RenderViewProxy name="RenderViewWithEDL" class="vtkPVRenderViewWithEDL"

        processes="client|renderserver|dataserver"

        base_proxygroup="views" base_proxyname="RenderView">

    </RenderViewProxy>

  </ProxyGroup>

</ServerManagerConfiguration>

Hi Matthias,

Thanks for your interest and thanks for pointing out that I forgot the
web-site for ParaView Catalyst. It's at catalyst.paraview.org. We're
working on adding a lot of content, like the user's guide, but it hasn't
got in there yet.

As for Elmer, Kitware would probably be interested in collaborating in
implementing Catalyst with their simulation code but we haven't heard
anything, at least to my knowledge, from them yet.

Regards,
Andy

Message-ID: <CAMGVExg0YCpVMZ9avPNN0kL80R2u-Pi3NRGR54OGoTjcXvvpaA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
As shown in:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/kj3phvgchm6o1o2/epv-volume.png
I have a cylindrical domain of triangles on the circular faces stretched
vertically into prisms. The threshold filter is almost perfect for
visualizing volumes in the field, except that the grid lines on the
boundary can obscure quite a bit. Does anyone have any ideas?
Any suggestions are much appreciated. Thanks!

I have combined a system based on wxWidgets with Paraview. I noticed that
whenever I run python commands through pqPythonDialog in c++, the wx event
loop stopped causing my wx event to be unhandled.

Does anyone know why and maybe suggest how to overcome this?

Thanks.

Subject: [Paraview] Linking error on Titan when linking simulation code to
 ParaView coprocessing for in-situ viz
Message-ID: <65F8B323A072504ABFC5D3D8751910514FEA1527@MAIL-MBX2.ad.renci.org>

I have finally got ParaView built on Titan with the pgi compiler. However, when I link our simulation code (also built with the pgi compiler and run successfully on Titan) with those ParaView coprocessing libraries, I got the following linking error:
----------------------------------------------------------------
/usr/bin/ld: dynamic STT_GNU_IFUNC symbol `strcmp' with pointer equality in `/opt/cray/xe-sysroot/4.1.40/usr/lib64/libc.a(strcmp.o)' can not be used when making an executable; recompile with -fPIE and relink with -pie
----------------------------------------------------------------
Before this linking error, there are a couple of warnings such as the following:
--------------------------------------------------
/ccs/proj/nfi010/ParaView/ParaView-3.98.1-source/VTK/Common/System/vtkSocket.cxx:425: warning: Using 'gethostbyaddr' in statically linked applications requires at runtime the shared libraries from the glibc version used for linking
--------------------------------------------------

I am not sure why glibc.a is still needed even when linking to ParaView libraries built with pgi compiler. I just checked ccmake options and find only the following two glibc-related options:
CMake_LINKER: /usr/bin/ld
CMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM: /usr/bin/gmake

I have built ParaView with BUILD_SHARED_LIBS off, but do have to link to a few shared libraries such as libpthread.so,  libalpslli.so, etc. since the corresponding static library versions don't work or don't exist.

Any idea on what could be the caveat? I am hopeful this would be the last issue to be resolved before we can link our simulation code to ParaView CoProcessing libraries to run in-situ visualization on Titan. Thanks for any ideas/suggestions!

Hello again,

I found a hack that works with the values that I'm trying to plot: I just
use I=10 and J=2, K=1 for 20 values, and Paraview shows exactly the 20
values that I have on the table. I know it's a hack, but it works for now.
Is there any developments on a more general Tecplot reader?

Cheers

Subject: [Paraview] Slice origin as annotation in animation
Message-ID: <CC1031CD494C4199B89CC7BAEFE5D6D6@PiaJensenHP>

Hello everyone

I'm quite new to ParaView, and ran into some trouble today: I am making an
animation where I vary the origin of a slice through my gaussian cube data,
to get a feel of the volume. As an overlay to this, I am trying to make an
annotation with the X-coordinate of the slice origin (changing for each
frame in the animation), to show the viewer a bit more information.

I have tried using the Python Annotation Filter with the slice as source,
but I simply cannot figure out how to get to the slice origin value. My
first guess was something like

  "Slice origin in X = %f" % (XSlicesOrigin[0])

but this does not work at all. Can anyone tell me how to get to the slice
origin coordinates?

Hi Andy,

thank you for your answer.
Could you send a notification when the user's guide is available on the catalyst web site? I will then post a message in the Elmer forum - as the main Elmer developer is on holiday at the moment, there might be more action from their side after the summer holidays.

Best regards,

Matthias

interesting project. I use the FEM code Elmer (www.csc.fi/elmer<http://www.csc.fi/elmer>), and I wonder if it would make sense to make it work with catalyst.
Question: I didn't find the User's Guide on the kitware website. Is is available somewhere so that I can give a pointer to the Elmer team, in case they are interested?

Hello.

I am not sure that it's a Tecplot reader problem. Paraview is a 3D 
software expecting 3D volume data (3 dimensions) or 3D surface data (2 
dimensions) with X,Y,Z coordinates. If you have surface data, you can 
just use I and J, and "K=1" may be removed in your Tecplot file.

But at this time, although it can plot data on intersection curves, 
Paraview cannot read mono-dimensional data. When reading data, Paraview 
tries to recognize triangle or quadrilateral cells and this is not 
possible with mono-dimentional data (in this case, cells count gives 
N/A). Reading such data would be useful for XY plots only, but if 
Paraview is a powerfull 3D software, I think that it is not the best 
tool for you if you want only XY plots.

Hello,
?
I was wondering if there was any reason that vtkLinearSelector is not available from the Python programmable filter?? I've tried using the following code to access it:
?from paraview.vtk import vtkFiltersSelection
v = vtkFiltersSelection.vtkLinearSelector()
?
Having a quick look at the source code Make file it appears as though the FiltersSelection module is not included in the VTKModules.cmake file, is there any reason for this?? If I include it and rebuilt the application would it work?
?

for completeness, I'll answer my own question.

view = CreateRenderView("RenderViewWithEDL")

does not work as I reported Friday. The correct syntax, is instead:

view = CreateView("RenderViewWithEDL")

Yes. You can simply turn any extra modules ON using the corresponding
CMake (advanced) variables without having to modify the
VTKModules.cmake file e.g. enable Module_ vtkFiltersSelection for
vtkFiltersSelection module, etc.

Hello all,

I am trying to use FIND DATA to find cells in my dataset with values higher
than a specific value.

The problem is if I use threshold I can see the cells in my dataset that
have values higher than my search field, but when I use FindDATA  on my
dataset , my run query doesn?t bring back any cells, though it should as
these cells exist and are shown using the threshold.

Could any body please tell me why Find DATA is not working on my dataset.

I really need to use FIND DATA  to see cells with values higher than a
specific value to analyze my data and find these cells and currently I
can?t as the FIND DATA deosn?t give back any results.

I would appreciate any help on what I could be doing wrong and how to fix
it.

Thanks in Advance

Hi Utkarsh,

Thanks for reply. If my query based on ID it works, That is if I look for
cells with IDs higher than 90,000,000, then 10 million cells are returned
in Query Results,but if it is another search field to find cells with
values higher than a specific value, I don?t get any results.

I mean after I push the Run Selection Query, nothing is returned and
Paraview is not hanging by the way and is working normal and just no result
is returned.

I was wondering why I don?t get any results. What I am looking for is to
find cells  in my dataset with values higher than (some value).

any ideas on how to get this?

Thanks in Advance

Message-ID: <C1449BEF40D5CC46B21272BB3529065980892F8D87@EXC3.ad.colorado.edu>

I am buying a new workstation, and I'd like to optimize it for Paraview. I run whatever the current Windows 64 release is. I visualize local (on my machine) cardiac MR velocity data; typically 192 X 132 X 42 grids with three components of velocity and computed vorticity, and a few scalars, in time sequences of up to 20 steps. Given a finite amount of money, should I emphasize CPU speed, number of processors, memory or graphics power? Here is the system I am considering:



Intel Xeon processor E5-1620 (four core, 3.6 Ghz, 10M, Turbo)

8 GB, DDR3 UDIMM memory, 1600 MHz, Non-ECC

NVIDIA Quadro K4000, 3 GB

256 GB 2.5" SATA 6 Gb/s solid state drive for the OS and programs

3 TB 7200 RPM 3.5" SATA  6 Gb/s for data.



Given an extra $500, upgrading which component(s) would give me the smoothest PV viewing experience?

Hi Utkarsh,

I created the wavelet, it was already point data, so I didn?t need to apply
the "cell data to point data" filter. and then I looked for RTDATA>100 and
it works and gives back results.

On my dataset though things are different.

1. If i look for cells , looking for cells with certain ID i get results.

3. If I select Query is and then type for example  *(temperature > 100)

then although just 5 cells in 100 million should be selected ( Threshold

Is there anyway to fix this? as this is very useful when you want to take a

Thanks in Advance

Subject: [Paraview] VTK embedded models in JSP
Message-ID: <CAONBuaoscknOV2U0XdftF9g9wCKxQWP2gxDq5_C-Mcw3pZZpXg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everybody,

I just started to use Paraview and I got a bit stuck. We have some JSP
pages where we want to embed and visualize some .vtk models. I considered
two options at first:

1- Deploy a server that will render the models. I tried to do that but I
found that I should compile again Paraview to start the pvserver (to enable
the MPI). I followed the steps here:
http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView:Build_And_Install but I got some compiler
errors that I have not been to solve.

2- Export the .vtk models into webgl (using the Paraview GUI) and embed the
resulting .html documents as JSP pages . This is the simple approach and
works so far. Regarding this option, I have two questions:

    - When exporting from vtk to webgl, we get one HTML file, one WebGL
file and around 20 tiny files with unknown information. Since it works
using only the HTML one, what are the rest of the files for?

    - I need this task (to export) to be automatized because it is possible
that we will have many models in the future. I tried to use Python
scripting but I could not find how to do it.  Any idea about how to do
it? Is there any documentation I could read? I was thinking of extracting
this functionality from the source code but I am looking for a 'smarter'
solution.

Thanks a lot in advance, and sorry if some of the questions are very basic.

Daniel.

PS: I am working under Windows as a constraint of the project.
PS2: I recently found the X Toolkit WebGL (https://github.com/xtk/X#readme)
that is currently working, but I would like to have other options anyway.

unfortunately it is more than 16 G and I can?t share it.
The filetype is h5 and its a PFlotran filetype. When I work with small
datasets of same type. everything is fine . but once I am working with big
datasets,
the problems that I mentioned occure. Could size be a problem?

Thanks

In addition, I'd like to stress that the 'Surface with Edges' display mode is the one I use most often. Displaying the actual cells (i.e. the quadrilaterals) in this mode would be really useful!

1) pvserver is not a web server. It is meant to run on a cluster for very
large visualization. Which is definitely not what you are looking for.

2) The html page is the only file needed for you. The other files were used
for development of custom web page when streaming could be involved.

Regarding your question about the scripting part, it is definitely doable
but I don't know the step on the top of my head.

You can try to use the trace and see if that give you the proper python
command for pvpython. Otherwise, you should be able to use vtkpython
without ParaView.

Hi Kyle,

Thanks for your reply. I just compiled ParaView version 4+ from source (64-bit Linux machine), the problem is unfortunately still there. Could you try opening the simple geometry I attached to my first message (18 Jul 2013)?

If it is indeed not yet possible to display the original cells instead of these wretched triangles, I propose to add a checkbox to either the View Settings Dialog or the View Panel, which enables/disables the display of (the outline of) the original cells.

Best,
Pieter

I had this issue in Paraview 3.14.  When I upgraded to 3.98 or 4.01 when I used the 'Surface with Edges' display mode, the mesh was just of the quads.  I am relatively new to ParaView but I try to help when I've had similar issues in the short time I have been using it.

Pieter,

The file you sent has 20 tets (not quads) and hence I see the
surface-triangles. Or am I missing something here? Try opening the
spreadsheet view then switch it to show cells. Each of the cells is a
tetrahedron.

Hi Utkarsh,

You're absolutely right. I was told that the script used to create these .vtu files always uses vtkQuad elements, but it turns out that it actually uses vtkTetra elements in some cases. Thanks!

Pieter

Message-ID: <50320452A334BD42A5EC72BAD21450990884DDCE@MBX210.d.ethz.ch>

Hello,

I need to set a python script running inside paraview and it'll take days, so I'd like to write out the time stamp (screenshot will be pic_XXXX.png so I could use that I expect), and when the job is restarted resume from the last frame.

Does anyone have a snippet that will find the right place to restart from that I can use. My python skills are learner level, so I'm hoping some does this regularly and can send a snippet faster than I can work it out myself.

thanks

JB

I'm sure that I've mentioned this before on the VTK list, but it would
help the overall organization of the wiki if each of Kitware's
open-source projects utilize their own wiki namespace, since all of
them share the same wiki.

Namespaces are easy to use: if you are adding a wiki page related to
ParaView, name it like this:

ParaView/My_New_Page

If you have several related pages, consider adding a nested namespace:

ParaView/My_Project/Topic_1
ParaView/My_Project/Topic_2

The wiki code will automatically add "breadcrumb" links to the top
of each namespaced page to aid navigation.  The main point of
namespaces, though, is just to make it obvious which pages belong
to which project.

you may use for example time, and replacing space with underscore.

import time

view.WriteImage(format("pic_" + time.asctime().replace(" ", "_") + ".png"), "vtkPNGWriter", 1)

Jean,

Thanks. Does the time.asctime() write the wall/clock time?
I am/was looking for a snippet which would (say) look at my directory, see that pic_0000, pic_0001, pic_0002 (for example) exist and then tell me that I need to resume from timestamp 0003 ... or alternatively, just write out some index to a temp file and then read it back and use that to resume from. My main script isn't working yet to generate the images I want, so I've not tried to implement the read back resume position. I'm expecting to generate 5000 frames and it may take quite a long time.

Hi John

I'm not 100% sure I understand your question correctly, but if I am
right and you're only asking how to find the index of the last saved
picture (and not about Paraview's capabilities to resume a job), does
the following snippet do what you want?

==>
from glob import glob
import re

def get_pic_index(filename):
    match = re.search('pic_([0-9]+).png', filename)
    try:
        index = match.group(1)
    except AttributeError:
        raise ValueError("Filename has the wrong pattern. Expected:
'pic_xxxx.png', got: '{}'".format(filename))
    return int(index)

existing_indices = sorted([get_pic_index(f) for f in glob('pic_*.png')])
print "Last index: {}".format(existing_indices[-1])
<==

Hope this helps (and apologies if I misunderstood your request).

Cheers,
Max

I often do this kind of thing. I've structured my pvbatch script to 
process a single timestep named on the command line. I have a bash 
script that looks in the dataset input dir for simulation timesteps and 
image output dir for rendered images. If the given input time's output 
image does not exist it kicks off a job. This structure has the benefit 
that it's parallel over time simulation time. I re-run the bash script 
until it submits no jobs, this easily catches failed jobs. note: my 
script has some logic to work around the fact that TACC only is allowing 
20 jobs in the queue at once, presumable you don't need that. You may 
need to use environment variables to pass info into your job, TACC's 
unique in that the batch system passes command line arguments.

Subject: [Paraview] Getting Python commands from the trace module (or other)
Message-ID: <DUB116-W1B0C07EBDEEB75528B381D96A0@phx.gbl>

Hello,

I'm using the lastest nightly build of ParaView 4.0.1 Windows 64bit on Windows 7.
I'm try to develop a Python macro that will allow me to setup the scalar bar after applying some other filters to the pipeline. I'm trying to establish the required Python commands by turning on the trace feature, changing things in the GUI (specifically: Color Scale Editor - Interpret values as Categories - Color Legend Tab, change font size, tick flip labels, tick show NaN, label as "texty foos"), and then stop trace. I'm starting and stoping the trace directly in the Python Shell using:

from paraview import smtrace
smtrace.start_trace(CaptureAllProperties=True)
# Do stuff in GUI
smtrace.stop_trace()
smtrace.print_trace()

However the results is always:

try: paraview.simple
except: from paraview.simple import *
paraview.simple._DisableFirstRenderCameraReset()


Render()
But none of the commands for fonts, text, NaN etc are there.
I've tried many variants of dir() and help() for various combinations of objects, but have had no success and have spent far too long on something that should be trivial.

Any help greatly appreciated.

Thanks, Bob

Message-ID: <CALdMxnzh+mT_hN9mGnY1DhhGNnLDch2=W1bS27PYimOn2iW0zA@mail.gmail.com>

I read in Paraview Wiki that as of Paraview 3.10 the MPI library is
packaged in the binary release. Do I still need to have an MPI version
installed on my computer to run Paraview in parallel in batch mode
(pvbatch)? If MPI is not required, then how do I run pvbatch in parallel.
Is there an argument to specify to use multi core on shared memory
clusters? Otherwise I assume that a MPI version is required and I'd run it
using "mpiexec -n Nprocs pvbatch python.py"

Thank you,

Nikos

Message-ID: <E494AC40135C1449BFE401739AD4218913343A0D@E-EXDAGE-A0.extra.cea.fr>

Hello,

I try to do some in-situ visualization with Paraview. I went through the tutorial : http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/CoProcessing

I run Ubuntu 12.04. I built Paraview from source (ParaView-v4.0.1-source.tgz) with :
~/Programs/Paraview/ParaView-v4.0.1-build>cmake -DPARAVIEW_BUILD_PLUGIN_CoProcessingScriptGenerator=ON -DPARAVIEW_BUILT_QT_GUI=ON -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON -DPARAVIEW_ENABLE
_PYTHON=ON -DPARAVIEW_USE_MPI=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DPARAVIEW_ENABLE_COPROCESSING=ON -DBUILD_COPROCESSING_ADAPTORS=ON -DBUILD_FORTRAN_COPROCESSING_ADAPTORS=ON -D
PYTHON_ENABLE_MODULE_vtkCoProcessorPython=ON -DPARAVIEW_INSTALL_DEVELOPMENT_FILES=ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/home/fh/Programs/Paraview/local ../ParaView-v4.0.1-source

When I "make install" there is no libvtkCoProcessorImplementation neither in /home/fh/Programs/Paraview/local/lib, nor in /home/fh/Programs/Paraview//local/lib/paraview-4.0/ : the co-processing example (http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Coprocessing_example) does not link !...

Also, I am not sure to understand how things must be run and set :
1. first, in a first terminal, I have to run the simulation (main program from CoProcessingExample.cxx)
2. then, I guess I have to run Paraview using a (pre-generated Python) script but I didn't really understand how to do that...
As far as I understand, at each simulation step, the simulation must generate, for instance, a HDF5 results file (that contain variables to visualize - each HDF5 must be labelled with the time step it is related to). Then, Paraview is used to visualize data from the corresponding HDF5 file (associated to the current time step) while the simulation keeps on running. And when a new time step is done (new HDF5 is generated), the Python script is used by Paraview to udpate the visualisation on screen. Did I understood correctly this part ? If yes, I didn't get how Paraview "knows" a new time step is "done and available for visualisation". Also I am not sure to know how to "launch the Pyhton script".

Can somebody help me on this ?

Thanks

FH

Absolutely marvellous, does exactly what I wanted. Just tested it out and it finds the sequence and returns the last index. 
I only needed to add an except handler if there were no files found so on the first run it sets last index to 0.

Many thanks indeed. I learn a lot from snippets like these.

Burlen : My mail server rejected an attachment from you with .sh extension. Do I still need it - given that Max's snippet server my current purpose?

Thanks to both of you

Hi John

I'm not 100% sure I understand your question correctly, but if I am
right and you're only asking how to find the index of the last saved
picture (and not about Paraview's capabilities to resume a job), does
the following snippet do what you want?

==>
from glob import glob
import re

def get_pic_index(filename):
    match = re.search('pic_([0-9]+).png', filename)
    try:
        index = match.group(1)
    except AttributeError:
        raise ValueError("Filename has the wrong pattern. Expected:
'pic_xxxx.png', got: '{}'".format(filename))
    return int(index)

existing_indices = sorted([get_pic_index(f) for f in glob('pic_*.png')])
print "Last index: {}".format(existing_indices[-1])
<==

Hope this helps (and apologies if I misunderstood your request).

Cheers,
Max

Hi,

I am new to Paraview, so, my questions seems to look obvious... Sorry about that.

At first I believed Catalyst was a sort of "add-on" to put on top of Paraview : so I built from source ParaView-v4.0.1-source.tgz one the one hand, and, catalyst-base-1.0.alpha.tgz on the other hand (believing I will need both).
I seems I have succeeded to run the CxxFullExample from https://github.com/acbauer/CatalystExampleCode :
1. I compiled the CxxFullExample pointing ONLY at the Paraview install directory (using Paraview_DIR in cmake) but I did NOT use the Catalyst install directory
2. I run mpirun -n 2 ./FEDriver feslicescript.py => I get fullgrid* and slice* files that are to be post-processed by Paraview while the simulation is running

My understanding is that I do not need the catalyst install if I build Paraview with build options from the "old" wiki page  http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/CoProcessing ? I am correct : using correct build options, Catalyst wiil be included in Paraview, right ? Catalyst is not an "add-on" (that you first need to link to, to be able, in a second step, to "do stuffs" with Paraview) , right ? Catalyst is more like a kind of "batch mode of Paraview" that extracts the necessary bunch of code from Paraview that enables to create the fullgrid* and slice* files without necessary need to install (the full version of) Paraview, right ?

Do I understand correctly ?

Also, is there a way to control the simulation live : is there a way to create commands like "run", "stop", "do one more iteration, stop and update live plots on screen" using a kind of client/server communication pattern ? (server = simulation running on a cluster, client = paraview running on a laptop). As far as I understand, with a Python script I can generate output to post-process while the simulation is running, but I can not control it (stop, run, step, select more or less stuffs to save for the current time iteration), right ?

Thanks,

FH

Hi,

That wiki page is a bit outdated. The best reference for that is the attached guide. I'm working on updating the wiki pages and making catalyst.paraview.org<http://catalyst.paraview.org> more informative. I'm hoping in a week or two things will be in decent shape.

Hello,

I try to do some in-situ visualization with Paraview. I went through the tutorial : http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/CoProcessing

I run Ubuntu 12.04. I built Paraview from source (ParaView-v4.0.1-source.tgz) with :
~/Programs/Paraview/ParaView-v4.0.1-build>cmake -DPARAVIEW_BUILD_PLUGIN_CoProcessingScriptGenerator=ON -DPARAVIEW_BUILT_QT_GUI=ON -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON -DPARAVIEW_ENABLE
_PYTHON=ON -DPARAVIEW_USE_MPI=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DPARAVIEW_ENABLE_COPROCESSING=ON -DBUILD_COPROCESSING_ADAPTORS=ON -DBUILD_FORTRAN_COPROCESSING_ADAPTORS=ON -D
PYTHON_ENABLE_MODULE_vtkCoProcessorPython=ON -DPARAVIEW_INSTALL_DEVELOPMENT_FILES=ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/home/fh/Programs/Paraview/local ../ParaView-v4.0.1-source

When I "make install" there is no libvtkCoProcessorImplementation neither in /home/fh/Programs/Paraview/local/lib, nor in /home/fh/Programs/Paraview//local/lib/paraview-4.0/ : the co-processing example (http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Coprocessing_example) does not link !...

Also, I am not sure to understand how things must be run and set :
1. first, in a first terminal, I have to run the simulation (main program from CoProcessingExample.cxx)
2. then, I guess I have to run Paraview using a (pre-generated Python) script but I didn't really understand how to do that...
As far as I understand, at each simulation step, the simulation must generate, for instance, a HDF5 results file (that contain variables to visualize - each HDF5 must be labelled with the time step it is related to). Then, Paraview is used to visualize data from the corresponding HDF5 file (associated to the current time step) while the simulation keeps on running. And when a new time step is done (new HDF5 is generated), the Python script is used by Paraview to udpate the visualisation on screen. Did I understood correctly this part ? If yes, I didn't get how Paraview "knows" a new time step is "done and available for visualisation". Also I am not sure to know how to "launch the Pyhton script".

Can somebody help me on this ?

Thanks

FH

Hi,

ParaView will have everything that Catalyst has, plus a whole bunch more
stuff. The reason for this is that if a simulation code is linking to all
or nearly all of ParaView there will be a whole bunch of extra stuff that
will be brought in that isn't needed for doing in situ visualization and
analysis, especially if ParaView is built statically. Catalyst allows for
specialized configurations of ParaView to bring in a minimal set of
functionality that is needed by the simulation code to do the desired in
situ processing. For example, in one Catalyst configuration the library
size added was around 20 MB while for linking with ParaView it was around
125 MB.

As for live viz, that is still in beta form. I started working on the
official Catalyst wiki (
http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Catalyst/Overview) and there is a
tutorial along with some sample files at the bottom of the page. There is
an example in the tutorial that should demonstrate the live in situ
abilities of Catalyst.

Regards,
Andy

Hi Matthias,

I finally put together a wiki page on Catalyst with the user guide in it.
The main page is at http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Catalyst/Overview.

At the bottom there is also some information tutorials, examples and other
stuff that may be of interest.

Regards,
Andy

Subject: [Paraview] Visualize quadratic multi cell type in a model
Message-ID: <CAHcCK+7y6hzbNFCHwm0GXEWWfxR0H4bzB7mpik2Q9O=OAXJZow@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I would like to visualize a model which has a mixture of quadratic elements
"Quad_8" and "Tri_6" in it.

I use the following lines for "linear elements" and everything is fine, but
the case of "Quadratic elements" it does not work.

<Topology TopologyType="Mixed" NumberOfElements="3" >
<DataItem Format="XML" DataType="Int" Dimensions="20">
6 0 1 2 7
3 4 4 5 6 7
9 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15
</DataItem>
</Topology>

from: http://www.xdmf.org/index.php/XDMF_Model_and_Format

It seems that the cell type number I am using is wrong. I found somewhere
on the web that the cell type number for Quad_8 is 25 and for Tri_6 is 24.

Does anybody know about the cell type number for Quad_8 and Tri_6?

Regards,
Babak

I was just wondering if there is a reason why the XDMF celltype codes are
not the same as the ones for VTK?

For example in VTK (through the python interface) I get for the quadratic
triangle cell type the following:

>>> from vtk import *
>>> t = vtkQuadraticTriangle()
>>> t.GetNumberOfPoints()
6L
>>> t.GetCellType()
22

Kind regards,

Marco

Hi Sebastien,

Thanks for your answer. I tried to use the trace but it seems that it does
not track the exporting process. I also downloaded and compiled the vtk kit
and I could not find the vtkpython module.

Hi,

the short story:

In my custom reader select some values using some sliders. Then push  
the Apply, at that moment, I (I mean the reader) read the file make  
the calculations for the construction of a field and set the sliders  
to the real final values calculated by the reader (so the user is  
aware of with values are used).

the long story:

Ok, my solution can be written like this T(x,y,z,r,s,t) =  
f1(x,y,z)*f2(r,s,t)   (this is a separation of variables). where f1 is  
a nodalfield in a mesh on the x,y,z space, and f2 is a nodalfield in a  
different mesh in the (r,s,t) space.
So my file holds 2 (or more) meshes with associated fields.
My field T (that lives in a 6 dimension space) cant be visualized in  
ParaView (or any visualization tool). So my idea is to fix (r,s,t) so  
the field T  becomes T(x,y,z,r0,s0,t0) = T(x,y,z) (this is a 3D field  
and can be visualized in ParaView).

In my custom reader I use 3 slider to select the values of r,s,t, and  
then internally I search for the closest point in the mesh (to get the  
value of f2). And with the older panel I used to update the slider so  
the user can know the point that is used for the calculation.

In this video you can see the reader in action http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6Vzww_cmhA#at 
=26 (details in  http://rom.research-centrale-nantes.com/overview/)  
but in this case I use the interpolation in the r,s,t space  so no  
update is done.


It this clear enough?

Felipe

Message-ID: <CAPBk00GxCmf1SpYLhf5zcRFY3M4V-=qfWWjp9bCbnHNCze-A3Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I have an HDF5 file with a 3D array (k=78,j=50,i=360) where the first
dimension (k) is the time. So I would like to plot one slab (a 2D array)
from this "cube" per time step, i.e., (0,:,:), (1,:,:), ..., (77,:,:).

I would appreciate any example or suggestion on how to do this in XDMF?
Couldn't find anything in the XDMF docs.

Thanks so much,
-fernando

In the Edit Server Configuration dialog with a Client / Server (reverse
connection) server type, enter the desired port number. The client will
then wait on that port for the server to connect back to it.

Afterward start up pvserver with arguments of "-rc -sp=port#" to make it
connect to the waiting client on the specified port number.

Thanks David!

Unfortunately, I am trying to automate the process, thus need to set the client side port number by command line or environment variable.  The user won't even know the port number I am using.  Further, it may/will change every run.

Any idea how to set the client side port number through command line?

          <Range type="int" min="1025" max="65535" step="1" default="random"/>

Thanks David!

Unfortunately, I am trying to automate the process, thus need to set the client side port number by command line or environment variable.  The user won't even know the port number I am using.  Further, it may/will change every run.

Any idea how to set the client side port number through command line?

In the Edit Server Configuration dialog with a Client / Server (reverse connection) server type, enter the desired port number. The client will then wait on that port for the server to connect back to it.

Afterward start up pvserver with arguments of "-rc -sp=port#" to make it connect to the waiting client on the specified port number.

Subject: [Paraview] How to move text in python scripting?
Message-ID: <BAY175-W37FA6C1D084FCA8A75CC44B4570@phx.gbl>

Hello-

I am a newbie in paraview may be my question is simple but I haven't been able to figure it out. How do you move text in Paraview? I am using paraview.simple in the python shell.

text1 = Text()
text1.Text = "Hello World"
Show()
Render()

The position of text1 is always on the left-down corner. I was wondering if it is possible to move this text and to add as much objects type Text() in several positions. The class Text() doesn't have a property/method Center so I am kind of confuse.

Thanks for your help,

Arturo.

Thanks :)! There are still a few kinks to iron out -- e.g. the
categorical colors don't work as well for floating point values, but
we have a good start, I hope.

After a bit of experimentation, it turns out that ParaView local client, remote pvserver - once it makes the connection - does not tie up the 11111 port with recent versions of ParaView.  However, as you are waiting for the connection (or if the connection fails and you keep the client open), the ParaView port (11111) will be tied up and others won't be able to start a remote connection.

With a little help from my friends (Ummm ... thanks as always, Utkarsh), the trick is as follows.  We are trying to execute a command line, reverse connected remote server on a different port than 11111.  We will connect to port 11110.

To tell if port 11110 is busy, use netstat:

Not busy:
>  netstat -l -n --protocol=inet | egrep 11110

Busy:
>  netstat -l -n --protocol=inet | egrep 11110
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:11111               0.0.0.0:*                   LISTEN


Now, let's make the connection:

Client side:
> paraview -url=csrc://localhost:11110

Server side (with appropriate MPI submittal and other support):
> pvserver --use-offscreen-rendering -rc -ch=your-client-computer:11110

Connects!

Alan
