I would like to add an item to the wish list for transient data. I save
my data at let's say every 50 time steps.
...
solf.002150.Rho.vtk
solf.002200.Rho.vtk
solf.002250.Rho.vtk 

There sets of data the last being solf.002250.data

When I do an animation with ParaView the files must be numbered
consecutively therefore I must do two
Things:
1-mv solf.002250.Rho.vtk solf.0046.vtk and likewise for each data file.
2-remove the .Rho
which is an time consuming and I need to note that solf.0046.vtk is
really time step 2250 and it is my density file. What would be nice is
to specify the number of time steps and the interval (2250 50).

I am creating time-dependent images using paraview (44 sets of data). It
works correctly in the interactive mode (creates 44 jpg images).
However, if I save batch file, select offscreen rendering, and
/net/home/swornom/paraview-1.2.1/bin/paraview -dr -b water.pvb
where water.pvb is the batch file, it creates 44 indentical jpg images
using only the first set of data. Any idea what  I am doing wrong?

This should work in 1.4. We have already released a beta (currently

I think, but am not certain, that if you use a .pvd file containing a
collection you can get around this problem.

A .pvd file contains "meta-data" about the files which contain the
timestep data.  In my case it looks like:

<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<VTKFile type="Collection" version="0.1">
	<Collection>
		<DataSet ComputationalStep="0" TimeValue="0.0" file="BoomOut.0.vtu"
timestep="0"/>
		<DataSet ComputationalStep="10000" TimeValue="1699.24599473"
file="BoomOut.100.vtu" timestep="1"/>
		<DataSet ComputationalStep="20000" TimeValue="3935.72359908"
file="BoomOut.20.vtu" timestep="2"/>
		<DataSet ComputationalStep="30000" TimeValue="6885.17303258"
file="BoomOut.3.vtu" timestep="3"/>	</Collection>
</VTKFile>

The only attributes that ParaView looks for (currently) are the file and
timestep attributes.  The ordering of the time series depends on the
timestep attribute, not the file name.  (At least, it seems that way.  I'm
not certain.)

I'm using XML file formats.

Message-ID: <1945.130.225.213.80.1083759810.squirrel@webmail.uni-c.dk>

Hi Berk (and others...),

In the process of converting some code to a plugin for Paraview I tried to
make vtkMy into a XML-module filter for paraview. And discovered that that
was extremely hard:
In order to compile vtkMy with TCL support VTK_WRAP_TCL has to be true,
in the ParaView/CMakeLists.txt the following line:
SET(VTK_WRAP_TCL OFF CACHE INTERNAL "" FORCE)
enforces VTK_WRAP_TCL to be OFF and hence I cannot configure vtkMy with TCL
wrapping ON (VTKMY_WRAP_TCL).
I guess I need TCL wrapping in order to make extra ParaView Filters
and also it seems like ParaView uses (some kind of?) TCL wrapping.

How do I solve this problem.

Once I get everything up and running the code will be opensourced - so
others will be able to benefit from this as well..
Best regards,

Michael

Hi Michael,

ParaView no longer requires TCL wrapping (1.2 and above). It uses a
simple binary-stream wrapping for its internal communication. There is a
way to have your own classes wrapped into this but I haven't done it so
far. I'll let someone who knows more about this answer (Brad? Jean?).

Dang, I was hoping Berk would answer that. :-) I pulled my hair on this 
issue and the only solution I could find is to build in 2 independent 
directories, where the 1st CMakeLists.txt uses a VTK installation 
independent of ParaView, and where the 2nd CMakeLists uses the ParaView 
install.

All the pertinent information about wrapping in ParaView were posted on 
this list before.

I've created an example in the new ParaView source tree under 
ParaView/Examples/PVLocal.  The directory contains a sample plugin and a 
README.txt describing how to copy the sample and create your own plugin.

Hi Bart,

I got your example up and running and everything works just fine! SO
thanks again.
However, now I have another problem: I want to watch a running calculation,
and preferably I want the visualization to update as the data becomes
awailable. I could implement this with an animation like loop of a dummy
variable (timestep) going from 0 to infinity (=1000000). However, doing it
this way stalls the interaction - I cannot rotate or change the
visualization while the animation is on. I have also tried to overload the
virtual Execute method and issue a Modified() at the end of Execute(), but
it doesnt force a new call to execute :-(
How do I solve this issue best?

Regards,

Michael

Hi,
I'm new to paraview but I would like to say I find it very useful to my
work (computational chemistry). I would like to ask you if there is any
way to calculate the volume which is inside of an isosurface.
I read a structured data set, h5 format, directly from an output
produced by a molecular modeling program. I generate the contour and
clip (using a sphere) the part of the surface I want to calculate the
volume of, wich is like a 3D ballon. So, how can I calculate the volume
of that ballon?

Thanks,

Hello !

First post to the list, but have been reading it one way or another for 
some time.
I am having some issues regarding metaimage files (.mha or .mhd ).
I have a raw dataset which loads and render ok into paraview, once I do 
the proper tuning using the raw loader.
Following the itk documentation instructions, I've edited a header for 
it like that:

NDims = 3
DimSize = 17 20 19
ElementType = MET_LONG
ElementSpacing = 1.0 1.0 1.0
ElementByteOrderMSB = TRUE
ElementDataFile = my_data.raw

(http://www.itk.org/HTML/Data.htm)

The problem is, dont matter if I put true of false as 
ElementByteOrderMSB value, it behaves as it's set to false.
I even tried to write with capital letters, changing the raw dataset, 
etc and all the way it gives me the same result as setting little endian 
with the raw loader.
I am using paraview-1.2.1, the binary package for linux, slackware 9.0 
with all needed updates, almost current, but I got this error also with 
  a debian-based machine.
The other filters I tried are all ok, although I am pretty discovering 
paraview and vtk yet.
Thank you in advance for your attention, and forgive me if this is a 
silly error, I just cant find any reference at the documentation I got.

Best regards !

Hi,

Regardig by last post... It is quite strange cos. when Im using paraview
1.2 I can fully interact with GUI as well as 3D graphics while an
animation is running. But in 1.5 the GUI and interaction is locked !?!
Is this the intention ? - Personally I find the 1.2 way with interaction
much more appealing... What needs to be changed (back) in order for
animations not to block the GUI ?
Btw. Im using Paraview on Windows XP (if this matters ...)

Cheers,

Michael

Subject: [Paraview] Adding a Filter
Message-ID: <4EB6E1738CC2E940BAD2EFBFBF5A38F101C3B1D3@OREADE.ipsn.fr>

Hi Michael,

For testing, you can load an external XML file in ParaView using the
"File/Import Package" menu.

If you want to load it dynamically at start up, you must set
PV_INTERFACE_PATH to point to the folder containing your *.xml files.
PV_INTERFACE_PATH has the following TCL syntax: (forward slashes and =
space
separated path sequence)
PV_INTERFACE_PATH=3D"C:/My plugin/autoloadxml" "C:/my second =
plugin/xml"

Once your xml file has been read succesfully, you should see your =
filter in
the filter menu.

The XML code into /ParaView/ParaView/Resources/Filters.xml is compiled =
into
a c++ file (or sthg like that) so it is not loaded at run-time.

(I use paraview 1.2.1)

Objet : [Paraview] Adding a Filter


Hello,

    I am using ParaView 1.3 and VTK 4.5.  I am trying to add in an
additional filter (vtkExtractGeometry), but I am having trouble =
figuring out
where to put the XML for the filter.  Someone at ParaView told me =
create a
new modules.xml file and set the environment variable =
PV_INTERFACE_MODULE to
the location of the modules.xml file, but ParaView didn't show any sign =
of
reading the modules.xml file.  I put in an obvious error into the
modules.xml file, but ParaView didn't throw an error.

    I then tried to put my XML code into
/ParaView/ParaView/Resources/Filters.xml file but it still didn't =
produce
any results.  I also, removed all of the XML within the Filters.xml =
file to
see if it was reading it, and it didn't produce any results.  So that =
leads
to me to question whether the XML file is dynamically read when =
ParaView is
initializing, or is it built into ParaView during build time?  Also, =
what is
the "correct" way to add a new module/filter into ParaView?

Thank You in advance for your help,

Mike

Hi Gleicon,

There were some issues with Meta Image reader. The new version of
ParaView (1.4) soon to be released should fix all of them.

Ezequiel,

Although VTK has a filter (vtkMassProperties) that calculates the volume of 
a closed surface, it has not been integrated into ParaView.  You could save 
out the data and use a VTK script to compute the volume.

Although it will not probably help you, you can get an estimate of the 
volume if your structured data set is a uniform grid (image).  Just use 
threshold instead of contour and look at the number of cells on the 
information page.

Charles.

Charles,

Thanks for your answer. Reading the ParaView documentation it's supposed
I can use any VTK filter in ParaView (eventually,:-)), so I will make a
try.

Thanks again,

Hi Andy.
Let me know if I can help testing it. My paraview version is 1.2.1 ( 
binary package) but I am trying to build an source code version from cvs.
Also, I know a bit of C++ , so if you think I can be of any use in this 
issue, drop a line.
Thank you for the feedback.

Best regards,

Gleicon S. Moraes

Hello
Is it possible to combine scalars to a vector?
I only have got scalars and want to visualise streamlines...

Hi S=F6ren,

Yes, it is possible. Run the Calculator filter on your data. iHat, jHat,=20
and kHat are unit vectors in each of the i, j, and k directions, so your=20
expression you want to enter would look like:
iHat * scalars1 + jHat * scalars2 + kHat * scalars3
(Substitute the 3 scalar arrays you want to use for X, Y, and Z in your=20
vector for scalars1, scalars2, and scalars3, respectively.) The array=20
specified in the "Result Array Name" entry will contain your new vector=
 array.

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView 1.4 Released
Message-ID: <0bae01c43914$88fcbb10$6901a8c0@kitwarein.com>

We have released ParaView version 1.4 and it can be downloaded from
www.paraview.org as usual. This release contains some significant =
changes.
ParaView 1.4 has better stereo rendering support including on tiled
displays. It includes support for compute-server render-server splits =
where
the visualization pipeline is computed on the compute-server where the =
data
is and then the resulting polygons are sent to the render-server (which =
may
have fewer nodes) for rendering. This is in addition to the usual =
support
for the client running on node zero or across sockets to another =
computer.
ParaView 1.4 includes progress reporting to help you gauge how long an
operation will take (you cannot cancel the operation but at least you =
can go
grab a cup of coffee). Writing batch files in ParaView 1.2 was mostly =
broken
and this has been fixed in 1.4. The accept button is now green :-) and a
bunch of other minor tweaks and bug fixes.

Having said that, there are still some know issues with 1.4.1 (this =
release)
that will be fixed in 1.4.2 which will probably be released late next =
week.
These include a problem with progress reporting in some cases locking up =
the
GUI and a few less critical issues.

Thanks to all the developers at Kitware, Los Alamos, Sandia, and the =
Army
Research Lab, and thanks for the feedback from everyone. If you run into =
any
problems please post them to the bug tracker or email the mailing list.

Thanks Again
Ken

I just tried to reproduce this behavior on the ParaView 1.4 release, but I=
=20
did not get the same results you did. After I ran the data through the=20
Calculator filter, it was still being colored by the same scalar array as=20
before, but the array produced as a result of running the filter was a=20
3-component vector array.

To my knowledge, there is not a problem with your file format or the=20
magnitude of the velocity components.

Earlier in this thread, you said that the expression you were evaluating=20
with the calculator was iHat * x1-vel  + jHat * x3-vel + kHat * x3-vel. Was=
=20
this a typo? It looks to me like you should not be multiplying the same=20
scalar array by both jHat and kHat. If this really is the expression you=20
input to the calculator, it would explain why your streamlines are not=20
doing what you expect them to.

Congratulations!

Downloaded and tried, works great except for the blocking 3D/GUI
interaction while running an animation.
Nice with the new users tutorial.

Well done!

Cheers,

Subject: [Paraview] Probe just made a little bit easier
In-Reply-To: <2843.128.165.144.120.1079474391.squirrel@webmail2.pair.com>
References: <2843.128.165.144.120.1079474391.squirrel@webmail2.pair.com>
Message-ID: <40A48877.7080307@cscs.ch>

Someone recently made suggestions for improvements of the Probe filter 
in his wish-list. I also checked bug #492, and paraView 1.4 does not 
quite answer these problems.

The biggest pain, is that Probe plots *all* variables and auto-scaling 
can make it impossible to look at your data in range [0-1] when you have 
another field in range [1e6-1e9].

To overcome this, I wrote a converter which takes as input the 
XMLPolyData file saved when selecting the Probe filter in "Line mode" 
and using "save data". The data is saved in binary with no option to 
switch to ASCII, so that is also hard on my eyesight.

My converter reads the XML PolyData and outputs ASCII data fit for Grace 
in NXY format. It also creates the small parameter file for the legend 
of each sets. I use Grace-5.1.14.

Take the RectGrid2.vtk example file, do a line probe, save the data.
The converters creates the following parameter file:

title "Title"
subtitle "Title"
s0 legend "scalars"
s1 legend "vectors_0"
s2 legend "vectors_1"
s3 legend "vectors_2"

and saves your data in Grace NXY format. You don't have to be an expert 
user of Grace (I started 2 hours ago) to learn to turn each plot on/off, 
and make nice-looking graphs.

I thought the converter would be useful to the ParaView community. It is

Actually, I noticed a similar problem on the CVS trunk yesterday. To
replicate it, load multicomb_0.vtu, run the "Extract Surface" filter,
and then create an Array Calculator. If you enter
	Result = iHat*Density+jHat*Momentum_0
you'll get an incorrect scalar field. However, if you enter
	Result = Density*iHat+Momentum_0*jHat
you'll get the correct result. For some reason, multiplication by the
unit vectors isn't commutative. I've tried this on two different
machines with recent CVS checkouts and got the same results.

Thanks for sending a simple, reproducible example demonstrating the

Thank you very much!
That's the point!
After changing the component names from x1-vel to x1vel and switch the
calcation direction from iHat*x1vel to x1vel*ihat everything works =
fine...

Hi,
Congratulations - the user guide is great.
I've tested it and everything ( at least that I use so far ) is working
great, except for the metaheader file loader, which I had fixed and sent
a patch to Mr. Cedilnik this week.
I think my mail system must have messed up the message, or it got lost
anywhere, because I got an error message today, so, if someone needs to
load a Big Endian mhd file and wants the diff I did, just drop me a
line. So far it's working ok with CVS version.
Also, I will try to resend it later tomorrow, after re-check what went
wrong.

BEst regards, and thanks

Message-ID: <1084897283.21644.27.camel@tfdpc236.tfd.chalmers.se>

Thanks for the new version! It is working smoothly for me on linux so
far. However, when I have more than 100 numbered files in a series
(file_1.vtk,file_2.vtk,...,file_105,vtk), the slider does not appear, 
and Paraview does no longer treat my files as a time series.
This prohibits me from creating an animation of the simulation.

This is not a new problem, and I saw a note in the bugtracker  
(Bug #656) mentioning that this was a set limit to optimize performance.
I tried compiling from CVS today, as the bugtracker mentioned something
about it being fixed (2004-05-10), but I did not notice any improvement.
Is there a way around this, for me annoying limitation ? I frequently 
encounter small timesteps and many files.

Best regards

Subject: [Paraview] Geophysical XYZ data - which format is best?
Message-ID: <BAY16-F21yGT2yLYXrO0002fc69@hotmail.com>

Good day.

I just got myself a copy of ParaView for the purpose of plotting geophysical 
data exported from the commercial software RES3DINV. Here is the format 
(.xyz):

/Name of survey line is Conversion of RES2DINV data files
/Number of blocks is 384
/Results for iteration 7
/The x, y and z coordinates the centres of the model blocks, and
/the resistivity, conductivity and IP value of each block is given below.
/The I.P. is given in terms of Chargeability with units in mV/V
/       X            Y        Elevation  Resistivity  Conductivity       
I.P.    Sensitivity
     137.439      649.996       99.450    80306.586     0.00001245        
21.018  7.4934e-001
     162.377      649.998      100.875    15099.280     0.00006623         
9.732  1.9640e+000
     187.142      649.996       98.675    68860.805     0.00001452         
7.808  5.4303e-001
     211.869      649.997       95.275    46299.848     0.00002160         
6.606  1.4108e+000

The output that I am looking for is a couple of 3D plots (the conductivity 
plotted at the x,y,z locations and the resistivity plotted at the x,y,z 
locations). The "ground" surface (in the x-y plane) will be irregular as it 
represents the topography. I would like to be able to contour the data 
cubes.

My question is: What is the most appropriate data format to use for data 
like this? I figure probably VTK format or PLOT3D format. The PLOT3D format 
looks a little bit more complicated than what I need - probably would be 
counter-productive to convert my data to that... But, honestly, I'm totally 
unsure. Has anyone else worked with a simple xyz data set like this? What 
should I use?

Any advice would help so much!

Thanks,

Steve

Hi All,

This is my first post to the list. Sorry if it's a dumb question.

I've been trying to read in a multi-part rectilinear grid but I'm
not having much success. Reading and writing the files works fine
using VTK but when I try it with paraview I get the following error:

Hi All,

Following on from my previous email, I noticed a previous thread in
which the "pvd" meta-data file was mentioned. I tried that and it
appears to work.

My question now is why doesn't the pvtr file work? The documentation
claims it is supported, but it doesn't seem to do the right thing.

Or am I missing something?

Keith.

You can use a collection to read your data. The files out_?.vtr do not 
have to be edited. Just use the following file out.pvd:

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<VTKFile type="Collection" version="0.1" byte_order="LittleEndian" 
compressor="vtkZLibDataCompressor">
   <Collection>
     <DataSet part="0" file="out_0.vtr"/>
     <DataSet part="1" file="out_1.vtr"/>
   </Collection>
</VTKFile>

Yet, I agree that there is something fishy. I have tried others setups, 
  getting the same error message. This works and is inspired from the 
chombo3D example distributed with v1.4.1

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView 1.4.2 released
Message-ID: <001701c43f65$e2cdee50$6901a8c0@kitwarein.com>

Hello Folks,

We are pleased to announce the release of ParaView 1.4.2. This release =
fixes
a number of bugs and build-issues that were in 1.4.1. Please let us know =
if
you run into problems. Some specific fixes include:

- Fixes to Glyph3D to pass all input point data.

- Fix the enable state of the UI after progress reports

- Fix interaction with the window during animations

- Fixes for IceT tiled display support

- Fixes to the MetaImage reader code

- ParaView should not crash (just don't load module) if input_menu =
element
is wrong (bug #557)

- Redistribute Data filters put back in and fixed

- vtkBalancedRedistributePolyData has to actually be built (bug #691)

- Better support for nodes with no data (ribbons, cutting)

- fix to support short data

- a fix for an array bounds write error when using tensors

- a fix for passing data between nodes when using the M To N =
redistribution
(empty "" array names)

- Particle files were being read incorrectly (bug #830)

- BUG: When clicking on ellipsis and adding files, widget should be
modified. Closes Bug #656 - If there are more than 100 files, time =
slider is
not created




Thanks
Ken

Message-ID: <1085505454.3425.34.camel@andoria>

Hello All,

First of all, I would like to apologize for the downtime of the server.
Looks like computers are not as robust as they want you to think. 

If you received this e-mail, that means the mailing lists do send mails.
I will make sure couple of things are resolved before I open mailing
lists.

Thank you.

Subject: [Paraview] Creating a reader for Paraview
Message-ID: <LAF29587@awe.co.uk>


Hi,
   I am trying to write data reader to plug into Paraview. I have
successfully created a vtk class called 'vtkLSPReader' (inheriting from
vtkDataSetSource), TCL wrapped it and created an XML description file.
However, when I start Paraview I get the following error message:

Error: In ParaView/ClientServer/vtkClientServerInterpreter.cxx, line 840 ...
: Cannot find function "vtkLSPReaderTCL_Initialize" in libvtkLSPReaderTCL.so

I have tried adding a function called 'Initialize' to my class (even though
I don't think it needs one) but I still get the same error.

I'm using Paraview 1.2 and use the VTK and TCL/TK source that came with it
to build my data reader.

Anyone got any ideas how I can get this working.

Cheers
Rupert

I think what you need to do is produce Client/Server wrappings for the
reader. Look in ParaView/Utilities/VTKClientServer to see how ParaView
wraps VTK.

Subject: [Paraview] compiling paraview 1.4.2
Message-ID: <AC89BDA1E3CCBC42B9CA5B50FE7934D30526B7E9@es10snlnt.sandia.gov>


I checked out the latest ParaView distribution to my Sun Solaris computer.
When I choose configure in cmake I get the error: 

"ParaView requires out of source build. Please create a separate binary
directory and run CMake there."

The CMakeLists code that checks for this is pretty straight forward:

# Disallow in-source build
IF("x${ParaView_SOURCE_DIR}x" MATCHES "^x${ParaView_BINARY_DIR}x$")
  MESSAGE(FATAL_ERROR "ParaView requiers out of source Build. Please create
a separate binary directory and run CMake there.")
ENDIF("x${ParaView_SOURCE_DIR}x" MATCHES "^x${ParaView_BINARY_DIR}x$")

You should only see that message if your source and binary directories are
the same. Double check your settings/directories and if you still have the
problem email your CMakeCache.txt file. You can also try sticking a 

MESSAGE("MY BIN DIR IS ${ParaView_BINARY_DIR} my src dir is
${ParaView_SOURCE_DIR}")
 Into the CMakeLists.txt file at the top of your source directory to see
what those values are.

Thanks
Ken

You probably tried an in-source build first, got the error message, and 
then switched to an out-of-source build.  Since there is a 
CMakeCache.txt file left in the source tree, cmake thinks that is the 
build tree.  Re-extract the source tarball into a fresh source tree and 
then try again.

That's what it was. Deleting the CMakeCache.txt file and rerunning worked.

There are two possibilities here. The first test you can do is from visual
studio try right clicking on vtkAbstractMapperClientServer.h, it should be
in the vtkCommonCS target under the header files folder. Right clicking will
give you a menu with a Compile option. Try that option. If the file compiles
correctly then the problem lies with visual studio 6. VS6 has a problem
handling large projects with many custom commands. We do have a vs6
dashboard but our path is a little shorter so maybe a shorter path would
solve the problem for you. The second possibility is that we have a problem
with the specific path you are using. That is less likely but still
possible, We have a vs6 dashboard with a space in the path but maybe the .
and - cause some problems.

Either way let me know how the one file .h compile goes. If that works fine
it is probably the path length.

Thanks

Subject: [Paraview] time filters in paraview
Message-ID: <16F54D8E44BBEE4BBBDB5EFB3AEEB86DBC516F@es06snlnt.sandia.gov>

Hello,

I want to create some vtk (and paraview) filters that do time filtering of
data (e.g. low-pass filtering, integrals, derivatives). 

For example, in paraview the user would read a data file, then choose 'DSP
Filter' from the 'Filter' pull-down menu. The user would then either choose
a stock filter setting, or enter their own filter weights. Finally the user
would select a cell or point variable array from the input data set. The
filter would be applied to this array.

The big problem is that it seems that paraview (and vtk) is geared toward
accessing one timestep (one vtkDataSet) at a time. These kinds of filters
need to access multiple input timesteps (and previous output timesteps) in
order to generate an output.  I havent seen any examples of multiple
timesteps being passed through the pipeline.

Has anyone looked at this before? Can anyone direct me to examples of
something related that has been done?

Thanks,

I think the current recommendation is to create a vtkDataSet for each
time step and use a filter that accepts multiple inputs (such as
vtkInterpolateDataSetAttributes) to perform filtering on them. This is
fine for work such as computing derivatives/integrals but can be
problematic when a computation requires small subsets of a mesh but over
a large time span since many readers don't allow you to request a
particular spatial subset of a grid be read.

Message-ID: <40B74E83.6060808@cscs.ch>

ParaView users

I just wanted to share some simple tricks to work-around some 
limitations of paraview v1.4.2 with EnSight (or other) time-dependent 
datasets.

The animation interface cannot handle time-values with varying time 
increments (it assumes constant time increments throughout the 
animation), and it has round-off troubles in some cases.

There is a simple workaround. Save the batch script and edit the Tcl 
code. It's trivial and will produce the correct answer.

example: I have an Ensight case file with a timeset of:

TIME
time set:                  1
number of steps:           20
filename start number:     1
filename increment:        1
time values:
0.00 0.025 0.05 0.075 0.10 0.125 0.15 0.175 0.2 0.225
0.25 0.3 0.35 0.40 0.45 0.50 0.55 0.60 0.65 0.70

ParaView unrolls the loop and writes the following stuff:

[$pvTemp109 GetProperty SetTimeValue] SetElement 0 [expr round(0)]
$pvTemp109 UpdateVTKObjects
$Ren1 UpdateVTKObjects
$Ren1 WriteImage {/tmp/b00000.jpg} vtkJPEGWriter

[$pvTemp109 GetProperty SetTimeValue] SetElement 0 [expr round(0.0368421)]
$pvTemp109 UpdateVTKObjects
$Ren1 UpdateVTKObjects
$Ren1 WriteImage {/tmp/b00001.jpg} vtkJPEGWriter

etc...

you can simply replace this with a Tcl loop

set i 0
foreach t {0.00 0.025 0.05 0.075 0.10 0.125 0.15 0.175} {
   [$pvTemp111 GetProperty SetTimeValue] SetElement 0 $t
   $pvTemp111 UpdateVTKObjects
   $Ren1 UpdateVTKObjects
   set fname [format "batch%03d.jpg" $i]
   $Ren1 WriteImage $fname vtkJPEGWriter
   incr i
}

Now, the last thing I have not been able to figure out is how to write a 
CornerAnnotation with the correct time step.

my trick is to add the following line in the foreach loop above

puts [format "convert -fill white -draw \'text 550,500 \"t = %6.3f\"' %s 
%s" $t $fname new$fname]

I run paraview like this:

paraview --batch batch.pvd > annotate_script.tcl

and then execute annotate_script.tcl

Hope this can be useful to some users.

Cheers.

Hi All.

I'm trying to find ways of visualizing parallel PETSC-based code. Are
there interfaces between Paraview and PETSC? Or any other visualization
techniques that will work with Petsc? Any information will be most
welcome
