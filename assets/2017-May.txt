Subject: [Paraview] Set color legend font color (pv web)
Message-ID: <4d95c9c2-3720-8095-61ee-0a212ed8cbc9@seoaachen.de>

Hi,

I try to set the color legend font color in protocols.py of paraview web 
visualizer.

def updateScalarbarVisibility(self, options):
     ...
    barRep.TitleColor=[0.0,0.0,0.0]
    barRep.LabelColor=[0.0,0.0,0.0]

but it doesn't change the color. Where can I change it (default)? I 
would also show it as default.

regards
Daniel

Maybe we need to see more context (how you got your hands on barRep, and
what else you did)?  I just used ParaView Qt client to visualize the
wavelet, and I changed these colors before exporting the state as a python
script.  I think the following covers what you should need to do:

from paraview.simple import *
...
rv1 = CreateView('RenderView')
...
lut = GetColorTransferFunction('RTData')
...
repr = Show(someSrc, rv1)
repr.LookupTable = lut
...
repr.SetScalarBarVisibility(rv1, True)
...
lutColorBar = GetScalarBar(lut, rv1)
lutColorBar.TitleColor = [...]
lutColorBar.LabelColor = [...]

Then finally maybe a Render() is required?

If you do all that and the color doesn't change, there may be a bug.  Even
though the protocols we have now do not allow for changing the title and
label color (at least not to my knowledge), you can manage this all in your
application code.

Hope this helps,
Scott

Paraview crashes. Is this the right way to read a vector from 3 separate

Howdy,

I have a question concerning visualizing VTK files in Virtual Reality.
Currently it seems that only one VTK file can be viewed at a time in
Virtual Reality. Will it be possible in the future to loop through VTK
files in Virtual Reality as is possible in the Render View? Or is this
already implemented but requires a settings change?

Hello All,

I was wondering if there are any examples on how to make an interactive
plugin. What that means is I would like to have the ability to adjust
(let's say) the size of a box and move it along an image to define an
object's (object is within image) extents.

Thanks,

Kevin

Justin you may want to send this to vtk mailing list in the future.

I believe you are asking for HMD VR as opposed to Cave VR? If the answer is
1) you can look at the sample application in the VTK source code and add
multiple models as you needed. Can you provide more detail on what you are
trying to do?

Thanks,

If you are talking about ParaView to VR (OpenVR) then you can view as many
VTK files as you want at once. Just open them up in ParaView and then send
to VR. The animation panel currently is not supported, so no animations
from ParaView to VR.

That protocols.py code snippet looks kind of old, what version of ParaView
are you running?  I don't recall precisely when we dropped the pipeline
manager abstraction in favor of the proxy manager, but it seems like awhile
ago.  Any chance you can update to a more recent paraview?  If you're on
Linux and using binary distributions, avoid version 5.3.  The 5.2 binary
might be ok for you, or building from master should be fine.

Hope this helps,
Scott

I use 5.1 because I have to use the .med reader plugin of salome 8.2.

Sorry for this late answer, I was out of office last week.
I'm building paraview in a cluster running "Rocks Cluster 6.2" distribution. It 
is based on CenrOS 6.7
I had some trouble with gcc 4.8.1 (internal error at compile time) so I moved to 
Gcc 4.8.5, this is OK now.

My ld version is 2.20.51.0.2-5.43.el6
I use a modified version of OpenMPI 1.7.3 (to work with my batch scheduler) 
compiled with gcc 4.8.5.

Setting mesa_USE_SWR to NO as suggested by Ben Boeckel  solves the "no such 
instruction" problem in building osmesa but my superbuild is still 
unsuccessfull. I've now an error in vtkmLevelOfDetail.cxx where I get "undefined 
symbols".
The full message is:

Are you building 5.3.0? If so, please use the v5.3.0-1 tag. VTK-m has
since introduced API breaks against the VTK in 5.3.0.

Hi Ben and thanks for your suggestion.

Even with v5.3.0-1  the problem remains. It seams related to the OSMESA config 
as a QT4 config on my desktop is successfull (same compilers and OpenMPI version 
but CentOS 6.9 instead of 6.7 on the cluster).

On the cluster frontend:

Subject: [Paraview] snappy display of inner points of large grid
Message-ID: <e10ef24c-e7f1-e97a-b5f3-90785c575ca8@phys.ethz.ch>

I'm visualising a large grid dataset with different regions == scalar 
colors with ParaView 5.1.2 on Ubuntu 16.10.

The computation prints the colors (floats in [0,1]) of a 250^3 (usually 
larger) grid into a CSV file:
x,y,z,color
0,0,0,0.5
0,0,1,0.5
0,0,2,0.3
...

I load it with ParaView (Python script), apply TableToPoints, set 
points.XColumn = 'x', etc. and the Points representation.
This works really well with opacity mapping and sliding the Mapping Data 
curve to highlight the different regions inside the grid.
The main problem is the large size (hundreds of MB) of the CSV files. 
Since the grid is rectilinear and equidistant, verbose x,y,z columns are 
wasteful.

Writing into a legacy VTK file with STRUCTURED_POINTS yields a nice 7x 
size reduction, but then in ParaView the inner points are not displayed.
I've tried using the Glyph representation, which makes the rendering 
unusably slow (10+ seconds for a small rotation).
2D Glyphs with Glyph Type Vertex are not noticeably faster and lose 
coloring.
Applying the Shrink filter (random googled hint) freezes the GUI for 
more than 5 minutes before I kill it. At smaller system sizes the 
performance is bad.

For the CSV->TableToPoints described initially, the resulting data 
structure is shown in the Information tab as a Polygonal Mesh with 1 
single cell and 15 million points, Memory: 600 MB. After loading it 
responds and rotates snappily on a recent Core i7 & NVidia GPU.
The VTK file loads with several million cells as well as 15 million 
points, and a Image (Uniform Rectilinear Grid) type. Memory: 15 MB ... 
much lower but irrelevant with 16 GB RAM.

It appears what I want is to have all points in one single cell, and the 
CSV reader is the only one I've found doing the right thing.

Using RECTILINEAR_GRID and custom CELL_DATA in the VTK file doesn't 
help: the format apparently doesn't allow to specify less than 1 cell 
per 8 vertices (or 4 in 2D).
Next I've tried to use a raw format, but after setting it up, ParaView 
insists on creating millions of cells. Same experience as with VTK.
I've also tried ExtractSurface to at least get a Polygonal Mesh from the 
Rectilinear Grid: still too slow and too many cells.

Something like a "GridToTable" filter with a subsequent TableToPoints 
would do the job, but I can't find such a function. Or a routine to 
merge all cells into one.

Creating a custom filter via GUI doesn't work because the loaded 
data.vtk "does not have any inputs".

How do I achieve the same performance and display of inner points as 
CSV->TableToPoints with either another file format or from the Grid data 
structure offered by the VTK file reader?

cheers
Donjan

PS: googling for
   paraview grid "to table"
mainly yields results for a typo in the documentation of 
TableToStructuredGrid, saying "Converts to table to structured....".

Hello Paraview,

I have an Exodus II reader, reader.

I'm trying to extract field data 'Full_EmissionCurrent' and

I tried to extract the data

reader.FieldData['Full_EmissionCurrent']

How do I actually get that array?

Message-ID: <ffb18d35-51d7-bd18-7396-d019e846e1bd@DLR.de>

Hi,

running ParaView 5.3 (self-compiled or binaries from the webpage) i got 
an segfault. Find the output of the debug below. However - using 
ParaView 5.2 everything is fine.

In 5.3 i tried Qt4 and Qt5, OpenGL and OpenGL2 - always the same.

Any ideas?

Hello Stefan

Does this happen when you startup ParaView, if not, what are you tring to
do before the segfault ?
It looks like you are trying to Load a file while connected to a server, is
that right ?

Hi,

fixed. It was the user-configuration. The (broken) ini-file has a size 
of  37 MB instead of 700 kB of an working one. Dont ask me why this file 
was broken ...

Thanks for the fast solution!

Unsure what you mean by this projection. Depending on what the layout it
might be hard or easy to assign U/V coordinates that pick the right pixel
for each location on the surface of the sphere.

There is a texture map to sphere filter which creates U/V coordinates on a
data set. Once the data has U/V coordinates, you can load an ally a texture
from the Display section of the Properties panel.

Don't load the texture as a data set.

Try this:
Sources->Sphere
Filters->Texture Map to Sphere
Properties Tab->Search ("Texture")
Under miscellaneous choose Load and navigate to your image.

The problem shown in the attached result is that the UV coordinates on the
sphere don't seem to map well to your projection. If you can define that
you can then create the texture coordinates in the Programmable filter
instead of the Texture Map to Sphere filter.

Thank you. That did the trick. I was able to apple the image as a 
texture to a sphere. So many options in the properties panel I was just 
not seeing the specific option that I needed. Forgot about the search 
panel. Duh.

That image got me pretty close to what I wanted, now to figure out how 
to generate actual texture coordinates, or color a sphere via each cell.

Thanks for the help

Subject: [Paraview] Change a property of multiple data objects
	simultaneously?
Message-ID: <CABDpjTnpoubLtuMgitn-S=HjR7Uo5+vc4m_+iKnj13xNF03kjw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Say I have opened 10 individual vtp files. Now I decide that I want to
change a property for all of them (for example, the Point Size, the
Opacity, etc.). Is there a way to do this without clicking on one, changing
the property, clicking on the next, changing the property, etc. etc.? If I
select multiple data objects and then change a property it seems to only
get applied to the last one in the selection.

Any ideas?

Thanks!

David

Hello,

I am using the PLplot library (http://plplot.sourceforge.net/) which allows me to write images in my Fortran code. This library allows me to create images without having to write the data file to disk. However, PLplot only supports sequential codes and I cannot find an equivalent library for MPI/Fortran codes. Do you know if Catalyst has a similar API in Fortran?

Thanks in advance,
Wadud.

Hi Wadud,

It should. A version with an adaptor from 4 years ago is here:

Continuing to battle with this...

Loading a VTK file, the CellCenters filter with "Vertex Cells" displays 
inner points but doesn't keep color information.
The PointDatatoCellData Filter stores the information in Cell Data, but 
averages colors at the region boundaries. Then using CellCenters 
(+Vertex Cells) does some additional averaging, but at least shows 
something.
Having PointDatatoCellData "Pass Point Data" allows me to access this 
original information as input to CellCenters, but that's not useful 
because it gets averaged at this point.
Can't see how to improve in that direction.

I've tried ExtractComponent, AppendAttributes and others to 
overwrite/adjust/... CellCenters' data array with the original color 
data, but I can't manage to do it with the built-in filters or Create 
Custom Filter. It's a size mismatch anyway.

Another option is to manually load the points into one cell.
Unfortunately both Programmable Filter and Programmable Source segfault 
regardless of the Output Data Set Type (ParaView 5.1.2, upgrading is 
currently undesirable due to 5.1 being the version for Ubuntu 16.10 and 
17.04, ideally the fix would be pushed in a patchlevel update).

I've tried to modify the data in pvpython operating on 
servermanager.Fetch(...).GetCellData() with AddArray(...) and 
GetArray(0).SetComponent(...), but this doesn't seem to be the right way 
to go about things.
Next up is trying to run a ProgrammableFilter within a pvpython script.

Any help on how to achieve the subject line with a reasonable amount of 
effort is welcome.

Hi

Paraview 5.3 on the desktop client is from paraview superbuild 
(v5.3.0-1-g8375204) using Qt5. It runs in standalone mode or with client/server 
(mpirun -np 4 pvserver  --use-offscreen-rendering) on the same  PC. I have to 
use  " --use-offscreen-rendering" to avoid some rendering problem with 
client/server.

Paraview is compiled on a remote cluster with osmesa support, by hand (paraview 
superbuild still fails at this time), it is v5.3.0-489-gdbdb86747e.

If I launch pvserver (mpirun -np 2 pvserver ) on the remote cluster and try to 
connect from my PC, paraview segfault:

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView v5.3: Generating textures from scalars and
 lookup table
Message-ID: <CAOr-WQt8C8TRZggqdzcC66Fvwg1BEV3ZchgRLUqOR+LF_gAG2A@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

Does anyone have idea how to solve generating textures problem?

I continued to decompose the problem and I'm curious, is interpolation of
scalars before mapping performed (when OpenGL2 is selected) by shaders
(on-the-fly, during display) or is an intermediate texture generated?

Also, in OpenGL case, vtkPainter was available. This is missing in OpenGL2.
Where has this functionality moved to or is it missing?

Nenad.

Patrick,

This means that the client and server versions are incompatible. The
client is trying to send over a new property, "PPI", that the older
version of the server does not know about. Making sure the client and
server are built from the same source (and remembering to update the
VTK submodule with `git submodule update`) is the surest way of
resolving errors of this type.

HTH,
Cory

I suggest using the group filter to make a multi block and then changing
the display properties of the collection there.

Alternatively there is Tool->Manage Links which should let you set up links
among the properties to control the whole set simultaneously.

Hi,

What is the process for getting Blue Waters at NCSA added to the list of servers that appear when clicking Fetch Servers in the Choose Server Configuration dialog?

Thanks,

2xN is a good texture. That is what you should get for both the old and new
backends (N covers the  scalar range, the 2 covers normal versus NaN, it is
a 2D map because of how normal scalar values should properly interpolate to
NaN).

When interp before mapping is on we do create a 2xN texture and texture
coordinates. The texture coordinate maps the scalar values into the texture
map. Interpolation is done in the fragment shader by texture lookup. The
process for cell data is a bit different but in that case there is no
interpolation. There we use a texture to map cellids to colors I believe.

If you have point scalars, and you write out the 2xN texture map along with
the color texture coordinates generated for it (not the texture coordinates
that might have come from the model or a source), then that should be
correct.

Also, in OpenGL case, vtkPainter was available. This is missing in OpenGL2.

OpenGL2 has a different design that does not use painters.

Hi David,

It's at: https://github.com/mvanmoer/paraview-hpc-support

bw.pvsc 
bw-win.pvsc

What's the recommendation for OS X to replicate the xterm/ssh, plink/cmd combos for making the connection?

Please ignore the one for JYC, that's basically just for me. (Unless you/Kitware have JYC access?)

Thanks,
Mark

Message-ID: <CADNeF3pNCMdNqd+yDRZk8KDsX5CJR8BSYnoh+wNAdoUPbg2M4A@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

Given three cell arrays (A,B,C) representation saturations (A+B+C = 1 for
every cell) is it possible to generate a ternary saturation image like the
one attached (obtained in
http://www.esss.com.br/Kraken/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Ternary-Saturation.png
)?

In the figure, A, B, C are saturations of water, oil and gas.

Best regards,
Thomas Oliveira

Subject: [Paraview] Bug or feature?
Message-ID: <CACqg2jd35GaqUuMJcx=a=JL=Rvvz4p7q9PJDpWfZ-rnBc0=40A@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Paraview users and experts,

In some project I am generating a dataset that has a multi-component column
as a result, with a variable number of columns depending on the problem.
These data are "cell data" of some "unstructured grid", and I can nicely
visualize it in Paraview, component by component.

Only with the visualization as a "volume" I have problems: It seems that
with this you can only visualize the "magnitude", while switching between
the components does not work! This works only in other viewing modes, but
the "volume" is sometimes very useful because you can look "inside" the
volume.

Now I am asking myself if this is a bug (with a certain chance to have it
fixed or even fix it myself...) or a feature?

I mean: the fact that "magnitude" is the default for displaying
multi-component arrays already gives some hint in the direction: this type
of columns is mostly intended to be used as coordinates! Which is actually
not my case.

Technically I could of course switch to just generating a set of
single-component arrays instead of one multi-component array. I only did it
otherwise because the columns are very closely related, so it looked like a
good idea initially...

Any hint or experience?

Regards,
Cornelis

PS: I am using Paraview 5.3 on Windows 64bit

Hi,

I am able to do a volume visualization for each component of a 3 component
array (i.e. a vector) of both point and cell data in PV 5.3. This was done
with a both a vtkImageData and a vtkUnstructuredGrid. Once I choose my 3
component array for volume rendering in the upper left corner of the GUI,
the default is the Magnitude but I can switch to each component as well
with the drop down dialog that is just to the right of where I choose which
array I want to pseudo-color by.

Any chance you could share your dataset and specific instructions on how
you're doing things? Alternatively, you can use the Calculator filter to
extract one component of your multi-component array but this is a bit
computationally wasteful.

Cheers,
Andy

Ken, thank you very much for your help. I think I solved my problem of
simulating InterpolateScalarsBeforeMapping (and getting sharp edges)
by re-creating larger colormap (4x1K) from generated one.

Thanks very much once again to everyone for helping!

Subject: [Paraview] dialog windows bug on Paraview 5.3 when changing monitor
	configuration
Message-ID: <CAC-oNP5ytVGXpLKujRcvwa_4ejqWtqLohSv0M6oDbYwHQHk6iA@mail.gmail.com>

Paraview Developers,

I have found a bug with Paraview 5.3 on Windows 7 (did not test to see if
it also exists on other versions/OS's). I recently changed computers, so I
moved my old computer to a spare desk. My old computer used to have two
monitors, but now it only has one. The last time I used Paraview, back when
it had two monitors, the file-open dialog was on the second monitor. Now
that the computer only has one monitor, it still places the file-open
dialog on the "second," nonexistent monitor. I fixed this by simply
plugging in a second monitor, moving the file-open window back to the
primary monitor, then re-removed the second monitor. This is true for all
dialog windows such as the python terminal and trace. I do not know if this
is a Paraview or general Qt issue.

It's not very often that someone gets rid of monitors, so it's probably low
priority, but it was certainly one of the most confusing issues I've ever
resolved, so I thought it was worth mentioning to the community.

Thank you,

Ben Orr

Ben,

Thanks for your report.

It also may work to remove the ParaView5.3.0.ini file under
%HOME%\AppData\Roaming\ParaView. That file stores window geometry
information, including positioning.

Best,
Cory

It probably has to do with your configuration files.  ParaView keeps track of how you left the app last time you ran it.  This includes locations for all of the dialog windows.

Just delete your configuration files, and all will be well.  Further, ParaView will look like it came out of the box.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [Paraview] dialog windows bug on Paraview 5.3 when changing monitor configuration

Paraview Developers,
I have found a bug with Paraview 5.3 on Windows 7 (did not test to see if it also exists on other versions/OS's). I recently changed computers, so I moved my old computer to a spare desk. My old computer used to have two monitors, but now it only has one. The last time I used Paraview, back when it had two monitors, the file-open dialog was on the second monitor. Now that the computer only has one monitor, it still places the file-open dialog on the "second," nonexistent monitor. I fixed this by simply plugging in a second monitor, moving the file-open window back to the primary monitor, then re-removed the second monitor. This is true for all dialog windows such as the python terminal and trace. I do not know if this is a Paraview or general Qt issue.
It's not very often that someone gets rid of monitors, so it's probably low priority, but it was certainly one of the most confusing issues I've ever resolved, so I thought it was worth mentioning to the community.
Thank you,
Ben Orr

Subject: [Paraview] Visualization ternary saturation
Message-ID: <2cc1c83b04574d89a3a11f6ac15b6af6@ES08AMSNLNT.srn.sandia.gov>

ParaView does not directly support ternary color maps, but if you create a field of colors (represented by three unsigned chars), then you can render those colors directly by turning off the Map Scalars option. You can create these colors with a Programmable Filter with a script like the following:

A = inputs[0].CellData['A']
B = inputs[0].CellData['B']
C = inputs[0].CellData['C']
colors = numpy.empty((len(A),3), dtype='uint8')
colors[:,0] = A*255
colors[:,1] = B*255
colors[:,2] = C*255
output.CellData.append(colors, 'colors')

Once you apply that script, color by the new ?colors? array and uncheck the box marked ?Map Scalars? (it is an advanced option in the properties panel).

Dear all,
Given three cell arrays (A,B,C) representation saturations (A+B+C = 1 for every cell) is it possible to generate a ternary saturation image like the one attached (obtained in http://www.esss.com.br/Kraken/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Ternary-Saturation.png)?
In the figure, A, B, C are saturations of water, oil and gas.

Ken beat me to answering this one... I'll just add that if the data is
floating point in the range [0, 1], you don't need to convert it to uint8
or multiply by 255.  Just creating a floating point vector will give the
same result.  This is a more recent extension of the functionality: I know
it works in 5.3 and master but I'm not sure how many versions back support
it.

A = inputs[0].CellData['A']

B = inputs[0].CellData['B']

C = inputs[0].CellData['C']

colors = numpy.empty((len(A),3), dtype='float')

colors[:,0] = A

colors[:,1] = B

colors[:,2] = C

output.CellData.append(colors, 'colors')

I managed to hack something together just using python

writer = CreateWriter(path + 'FieldData.csv', reader, Precision=12,
UseScientificNotation=1, FieldAssociation='Field Data')
writer.UpdatePipeline()

fname = glob.glob(path + 'FieldData*.csv')
FieldData = numpy.genfromtxt(fname[0], delimiter=',').transpose()

But it's kind of annoying that I had to leave Paraview to do it.

Subject: [Paraview] workstation slow render
Message-ID: <CAHhX17dP0mjL+S+xO+wBtdcLiFXL77VESmT2spfWtaN3s+ofQw@mail.gmail.com>

Trying to make some animations on a new workstation (everything is local!)
and things are unbelievably slow (my 8 year old mac pro runs faster with
paraview!)

System specs:
Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2697 v4 @ 2.30GHz (18 cores)
128 Gb ram
NVIDIA Corporation GM204GL [Quadro M4000]
Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS


I'm using the proprietary nvidia drivers. I installed from source (git),
using;
ccmake -DQt5_DIR=$QTLOC/Qt5.6.2/5.6/gcc_64/lib/cmake/Qt5 ./$PVLOC/ParaView

enable python, turned off shared libs, and enabled mpi

any thoughts? size of the model doesnt matter, just that it runs faster on
an 8 year old machine with PV4, then it does on this workstation.

Any way to make a single instance of ./bin/paraview use more than one core?

Any way to check that gpu rendering is occuring correctly?

these questions were all searched for online but not adequately answered.

colors = numpy.empty((len(A),3), dtype='uint8')
colors[:,0] = A*255
colors[:,1] = B*255
colors[:,2] = C*255
output.CellData.append(colors, 'colors')

Once you apply that script, color by the new ?colors? array and uncheck the box marked ?Map Scalars? (it is an advanced option in the properties panel).

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [Paraview] Visualization ternary saturation

Dear all,
Given three cell arrays (A,B,C) representation saturations (A+B+C = 1 for every cell) is it possible to generate a ternary saturation image like the one attached (obtained in http://www.esss.com.br/Kraken/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Ternary-Saturation.png)?
In the figure, A, B, C are saturations of water, oil and gas.
Best regards,
Thomas Oliveira

Ken,

This was implemented some time ago. In 5.3.0, I could do the following:

* Add Sphere Source
* Add Programmable Filter with the Script set to

A = inputs[0].PointData['Normals'][:,0]
B = inputs[0].PointData['Normals'][:,1]
C = inputs[0].PointData['Normals'][:,2]
colors = numpy.empty((len(A),3), dtype='float')
colors[:,0] = A
colors[:,1] = B
colors[:,2] = C
output.PointData.append(colors, 'colors')

* Turn off Map Scalars

You could also skip this silly use of the Programmable Filter
altogether and color the Sphere source by 'Normals', then turn Map
Scalars off.

I believe the capability to treat floating-point arrays of 3-tuples
was added to VTK in commit

commit 00de9a942ff74e797fbe4cd8c67307c8065cdade
Author: Dan Lipsa <dan.lipsa at kitware.com>
Date:   Thu Nov 20 13:35:35 2014 -0500

    Add VTK_COLOR_MODE_DIRECT_SCALARS. See vtkScalarsToColors::MapScalars.

Zach,

Thanks for your report. However, I can't seem to reproduce that on macOS
10.11.6.

What version of macOS are you using? Could it be a permissions issue on
your system?

Hi all,

Indeed, rather than supporting only 'unsigned char' for direct color
mapping - using color mode VTK_COLOR_MODE_DEFAULT, all integer and floating
point types can be used for direct color mapping using the color mode
VTK_COLOR_MODE_DIRECT_SCALARS.
Integer type colors should be between 0-255 and floating point colors
should be between 0-1.

Subject: [Paraview] Complex filters for structured meshes
Message-ID: <CAOmyp+QMgESNTw2xnA1RBU2bv0Y2x-_UVqpWpuosT-yKopreJQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I work with a CFD code that uses a structured mesh.  We frequently want to
do math operations that require each cell to have knowledge of its
neighbors.  Things such as a calculating the max of a certain variable, or
a gradient in a given direction.

I'm not sure the best way to accomplish this.  I have a code snippet for
use in the programmable filter that I use (copied below), but its behavior
is similar to the calculator in that it works on individual cells without
knowledge of cell neighbors.

Can somebody A) critique my skeleton code below to let me know if I could
write it better and B) help me with figuring out a method (any method) that
has visibility of neighbor cells?

Thanks

-David Ortley


# Programmable filter snippet:
pdi=self.GetInput()
pdo=self.GetOutput()

numCells = pdi.GetNumberOfCells()
cells = pdi.GetCellData()

# Some array already in the calc results that I'm going to reason on
# say it's pressure or energy or something
orig_array = cells.GetArray("orig_array")

# Storing
new_array = vtk.vtkDoubleArray()
new_array.SetName("new_array")

for i in range(numCells):
    # do some work
    blah  = pkovpr.GetValue(i) * 1.23456789
    # store as new val in array
    new_array.InsertNextValue(blah)

# Add the array I just created to the output so Paraview can do stuff with
it
pdo.GetCellData().AddArray(betaMax)

Aha! I figured out the issue. Yes, ParaView correctly shows floating point colors when in the Surface representation, but it does not work for the Slice representation. (I happened to be creating data on a Mandelbrot source.)

I raised a bug: https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/issues/17423

Ken,

This was implemented some time ago. In 5.3.0, I could do the following:

* Add Sphere Source
* Add Programmable Filter with the Script set to

A = inputs[0].PointData['Normals'][:,0]
B = inputs[0].PointData['Normals'][:,1]
C = inputs[0].PointData['Normals'][:,2]
colors = numpy.empty((len(A),3), dtype='float')
colors[:,0] = A
colors[:,1] = B
colors[:,2] = C
output.PointData.append(colors, 'colors')

* Turn off Map Scalars

You could also skip this silly use of the Programmable Filter
altogether and color the Sphere source by 'Normals', then turn Map
Scalars off.

I believe the capability to treat floating-point arrays of 3-tuples
was added to VTK in commit

commit 00de9a942ff74e797fbe4cd8c67307c8065cdade

    Add VTK_COLOR_MODE_DIRECT_SCALARS. See vtkScalarsToColors::MapScalars.

Hi,

Please keep the discussions on the mailing list so that everyone that wants
to can follow along.

I'm able to volume render by components as well as magnitude. It may be
that you need to play around with the Color Map Editor to get things as
you'd like them to look.

I'm not an expert on volume rendering but it seems to me like something is
wrong with your cell connectivity when I use the Extract Surface filter.
It's possible that this is also causing issues with the volume rendering
but I couldn't say for sure.

Hello,

Sorry for not posting to the list: this was by mistake, not my intention!
(But there is also this "feature" of the list that it never sends me my own
postings back - with the effect that my mail program (Gmail) moves threads
in the mailing list that I have initiated to my personal mail folder, no
way to bring it to the forums.

I am thus posting the stripped down example once more for all, together
with screen shots that illustrate the problem:

example_0.zip - contains the vtu file with the unstructured grid.
Displaying Col2Comp::Comp2 shows the problem best

screenshot1.jpg - shows how it looks with "Surface" rendering on my computer
screenshot2.jpg - shows the same with "Volume" rendering --> WRONG!
screenshot3.jpg - shows the same again, but now after extracting
Col2Comp::Comp2 into a separate column using the "Calculator" filter -->
CORRECT!

Regarding the color map editor I can only say so far that I did not change
anything between the 3 screenshots - and since screenshot3 shows the
correct display I am not really sure that this is the issue.

The cell connectivity is indeed not as it is typically expected: The blocks
are touching each other, but only vertically adjacent blocks also share
edges and nodes. This is on purpose because it reflects the kind of problem
I am dealing with. Of course it is possible that also this influences the
volume rendering, but again the fact that screenshot 3 is correct while 2
is wrong lets me doubt this track.

My guess without further investigation is that it might be some caching
issue: Assuming that a rendered volume is somehow kept in memory for a
possible further use, there might be some problem with managing the cached
data for "columns" and "components" properly.

In other words: My current guess is that there is a bug in the volume
rendering.

With kind regards - and thanks for any helpful hints!
Cornelis

Subject: [Paraview] Rotation of a slice
Message-ID: <20170510134836.Horde.Ie483vVozMyhI8nujKI-Fg9@webmail.uni-paderborn.de>


Hi all,

I am working on a python script to rotate a slice in the x-y-plane and  
can't find a way to compute the parameters for the Transform filter.

The slice is computed by a script and is defined by the origin and the  
normal. It looks like this:

https://www.pic-upload.de/view-33136320/slice.png.html

The origin is (12.65, 10.55, 3.0)
The normal is (9.28454496846, -68.7942219477, 21.4027743404)
or (0.127811549959, -0.947024993173, 0.294631753216) if it is normalized.

Now I want to rotate the slice in the x-y-Plane, so that the normal of  
the rotated slice points in z-direction.

I tried to rotate the normal-vector with the rotation matrices (  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_matrix ), but it does not work.  
The computed vector shows somewhere, but not in z-direction, when I  
set it in the Transform filter.

The right rotation input for the transform filter is approximately  
(-71, -19, 0) but I have no idea, how to get there by computation. The  
angle of the normal with the x-axis is about 82 degrees, with the  
y-axis about 161 degrees. I computed rotation_matrix_X and  
rotation_matrix_Y with the angles and multiplied:
rotated_normal = rotation_matrix_X * normal
rotated_normal = rotation_matrix_Y * rotated_normal

The result is (-30, -30, 59) which is far away from (-71, -19, 0).

What is the right way to compute the rotation parameters of the  
Transform filter out of the data of the Slice filter (Origin and  
Normal)?

Best Regards
Alexander

Managed to do it in a rather silly way:
Load the vtk point data into a vtkTable, push that and apply 
TableToPoints. Code attached.

Main takeaway: please never change the TableToPoints filter in case that 
is considered (as, for example, it's not in servermanager.sources and 
would be edited when moving there). It's the only filter I found doing 
the right thing and using only one cell.

By the way, paraview.servermanager.sources.TrivialProducer() is not 
accessible on importing just paraview.servermanager, you also need to 
import paraview.simple. Not sure if this is by design.

By the way #2, a "print(1)" ProgrammableFilter is even crashing via 
pvpython scripts (Run Script) in Ubuntu's standard ParaView (5.1.2).

Unsubscribing from this list as not interested in the traffic, so if 
anybody wants to address me, please add me in the CC.

cheers

Subject: [Paraview] what does gaussian radius represent when "use scale
 array" is on or off, separately?
Message-ID: <17b56ab.345ac.15bf248e052.Coremail.yzhzhang@ipe.ac.cn>



Hello,

I'm using ParaView 5.2.0 to render some points. I'm using the GUI. I want to render the points as spheres so I select point gaussian. In the data file, there is a data array that defines the radii of the spheres, which range from 1.23e-4 to 2.46e-4. If I set the gaussian radius to 1.23e-4, it looks fine, though it doesn't show the difference of the spheres' radii. When I click use scale array and choose the radius array to be the gaussian scale array, all the spheres disappear. I guess maybe in this situation, the rendered radii are the product of gaussian radius and the values in the radius array, resulting to be at the scale of e-8. Then I set gaussian radius to 1, but it seems that it is still too small and no sphere appear. I keep increasing the value of  gaussian radius to 500, and the rendered radii seem to be of the same scale of the beginning. If gaussian radius is the true radius of the spheres defined by the data file when use scale array is off, what it represents when use scale array is on? Why is 500 the proper value?

Dear Mr. Parkins

Since your question may be better suited for the ParaView mailing-list,
i've included it in the recipient.
ParaView hardware requirement are pretty basic, however it may grow
depending on the data you want to handle and the type of operation you want
to do on it.

For a visualisation course, there is no reason to handle large dataset, so
in this case basic requirement should suffice.

CPU : Any kind of modern processor (lets say Core 2 Duo and after)
RAM : 4Gb (must be able to open your dataset basically)
300 Mb of disk space

Recommended : OpenGL 3.2 capable GPU (nVidia 100M / Intel HD400 and after,
with updated drivers)

So as you can see, it is not much.

Regards,

Mathieu Westphal

Subject: [Paraview] ResetCamera throwing bad_alloc
Message-ID: <10A03274360DCF47A6EE78C9952A31CA91E92B70@UCOLHPUD.easf.csd.disa.mil>

Hello,

I am getting an error on running a python script with pvpython and ParaView
5.3.0 on linux.

# get active view
renderView1 = GetActiveViewOrCreate('RenderView')

# uncomment following to set a specific view size
renderView1.ViewSize = [1200, 600]

# Properties modified on renderView1
renderView1.Background = [1.0, 1.0, 1.0]

#Show stuff in renderView1
.
.
.

# reset view to fit data
renderView1.ResetCamera()

ResetCamera() is throwing an error

terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::bad_alloc'
  what():  std::bad_alloc

Has anyone seen this particular error before with just calling ResetCamera()
on a renderView?

Thanks,

Joe

Do you see the error if you comment out all the "#Show stuff in
renderView1" part?

Utkarsh,

It does not crash when it is commented out.

It is trying to read an ExodusII file

# create a new 'ExodusIIReader
test_data = ExodusIIReader(FileName=path)

# show data in view
test_Display = Show(test_data, renderView1)

but does not crash until ResetCamera is called.

So, I guess the problem is with the ExodusIIReader,
and just doesn't manifest until the ResetCamera,
triggers an update to the pipeline. I know the data
is okay as I can read it with another version of ParaView
5.3.0 on the same system.

Thanks,

Joe

Thanks Mathieu, that?s really helpful. The compute power for the datasets
being visualised will be making use of some kind of HPC, most likely.



There is currently some consideration of using Chromebooks for the course,
does anyone on the mailing list have any experience of using these with
ParaView?



Best wishes,



Kat

Dear Mr. Parkins

Since your question may be better suited for the ParaView mailing-list,
i've included it in the recipient.

ParaView hardware requirement are pretty basic, however it may grow
depending on the data you want to handle and the type of operation you want
to do on it.

For a visualisation course, there is no reason to handle large dataset, so
in this case basic requirement should suffice.

CPU : Any kind of modern processor (lets say Core 2 Duo and after)

RAM : 4Gb (must be able to open your dataset basically)

300 Mb of disk space

Recommended : OpenGL 3.2 capable GPU (nVidia 100M / Intel HD400 and after,
with updated drivers)

So as you can see, it is not much.

Regards,


Mathieu Westphal

Subject: [Paraview] gpu_shader4 extension is not supported
Message-ID: <58292800-ab8a-c729-4dfe-63bb9fef8a03@legi.grenoble-inp.fr>

Hi,

I'm still trying to build paraview 5.3 with Qt4.8. As paraview superbuild was 
failing on my desktop (centos 6.9, Nvidia GPU), I build paraview by hand and it 
is running now with and without pvserver connection
.
The problem went back with building same paraview version on the cluster 
frontend: CentOS 6.7, no GPU. The compilation is successfull but launching 
paraview I get some errors with OpenGL:

ERROR: In 
/kareline/data/begou/PARAVIEW5/paraview/VTK/Rendering/OpenGL2/vtkOpenGLRenderWindow.cxx, 
line 825
vtkXOpenGLRenderWindow (0x2280fb0): GL version 2.1 with the gpu_shader4 
extension is not supported by your graphics driver but is required for the new 
OpenGL rendering backend. Please update your OpenGL driver. If you are using 
Mesa please make sure you have version 10.6.5 or later and make sure your driver 
in Mesa supports OpenGL 3.2.

ERROR: In 
/kareline/data/begou/PARAVIEW5/paraview/VTK/Rendering/OpenGL2/vtkXOpenGLRenderWindow.cxx, 
line 812
vtkXOpenGLRenderWindow (0x2280fb0): failed to create offscreen window

ERROR: In

line 813
vtkXOpenGLRenderWindow (0x2280fb0): GLEW could not be initialized.

I've built and installed mesa from mesa-17.0.4.tar.gz using:
./configure \
PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/share/apps/paraview-5.3.0/lib/pkgconfig \
--prefix=/share/apps/paraview-5.3.0 \
--disable-osmesa --enable-gallium-osmesa --enable-gallium-llvm \
--with-llvm-prefix=/share/apps/paraview-5.3.0

With several requested libraries:
libxshmfence-1.2.tar.gz
libxcb-1.12.tar.gz
libXau-1.0.8.tar.gz
pthread-stubs-0.3.tar.gz
xcb-proto-1.12.tar.gz
libdrm-2.4.70.tar.gz
llvm-4.0.0.src.tar.xz
all under /share/apps/paraview-5.3.0/

I've checked with strace that paraview was loading libGL in 
/share/apps/paraview-5.3.0/lib and not the system one, requested by other 
application (frontend is in production and I cannont break these libraries used 
by other softwares).


I must confess I'm not familiar at all with these libraries and environments, 
mesa or osmesa, GPU or not GPU, of screen rendering... all documentation deeping 
in obscure details while I'm searching to understand these concepts.
it is clear for me that on the nodes (without GPU) I will use OSMesa and no GUI, 
but on the frontend where I need GUI ???

Thanks for your advices and sorry if this is a very basic lack of understanding 
from myself.

Patrick

Hi Patrick,

When you build Mesa, what does the summary at the end of ./configure look
like? That should let us know if Mesa is getting built with sufficient
options.  For example, when I configure with LLVM 4.0 and Mesa 17.0.5 using
the settings described on the ParaView Wiki,
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/ParaView_And_Mesa_3D#Installing_Mesa_llvmpipe_and_swr_drivers,
I get the following summary from configure:

        prefix:          /opt/mesa/17.0.5
        exec_prefix:     ${prefix}
        libdir:          ${exec_prefix}/lib

Joe,

I suspect there is indeed some data corruption going on. Do you have a
debug build? Or can you share the data with me? Let's see where the
exception is being thrown that will illuminate the problem.

Hi Patrick,

OSMesa (and friends such as OpenSWR) do not need to make use of GLX. In 
fact I think it should be disabled completely for that case in both Mesa 
and ParaView builds. For eg, when you configure ParaView you'd specify 
-DVTK_USE_X=OFF. At least this is how it was in the past. I haven't been 
following developments lately. The wiki 
<http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/ParaView_And_Mesa_3D> has specifics.

Hello,

Is there a way to select a block from a multiblock dataset and update its
position independent of the rest of the dataset?

"Extract Block" will copy a selected block to a new data set that you
can reposition. The original block will remain in the original
dataset, which maybe isn't what you want. You could also pick the
inverse selection of blocks in a second "Extract Block" filter and
then apply the "Group" filter to put the moved block and other blocks
again.

HTH,
Cory

Subject: [Paraview] Integration points visualization
Message-ID: <81A18720EB4BBA489B6552676D14533C55614221@chimbx4.ad.uillinois.edu>

Hi,
I have a question about integration points visualization.
I have a vtk file which stores 3 components of each element in the domain: Sigma_xx, Sigma_yy, Sigma_xy. However, I need to do some complicated calculation by using these three components and then obtain a new number. So I first save the three CSV. files for each component. Then I finish the calculation in Matlab to obtain a new CSV file which is the same format as each of the three component CSV file.

By the way, I searched on the Internet and find the possible ways to process:
1. Use XML file to visualize integration points.
2. Change CSV file by using filter ( table to structured grid). However, there are no x,y,z columns in my csv file. It only contains row ID, vtk original point ids and point0, point1 and point2.

Best,
Teng

Subject: [Paraview] netcdf
Message-ID: <CACvTYE7wGhHiQUJ+hzkP4B99NV+fcuyJoSUMcP0-eaGoLruQ3A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, I have a question about netcdf formats.  I am developing a coupled ice
sheet - ocean model.  Currently both models run in the same cartesian
coordinate system.  The ice model outputs unstructured .vtu files, which
paraview reads just fine.  The ocean model outputs structured netcdf
files.  If I naively select the "generic and CF conventions" option when
reading the ocean netcdf file then the data display ok, but not to scale.
It seems like the structured fields have been read in just fine, but the
coordinate variables have not.  I don't think the netcdf files are CF
compliant.  I would like to be able to read in both .vtu files and netcdf
files and display the data sets together on the same scale.

Do you know what I need to do to read in the netcdf coordinate vars
correctly?  I am hoping that I can simply insert a post-processing step to
implement some minor manipulation to the ocean model output files so that
Paraview can read them in to scale.  Is it simply a case of renaming the
coordinate variables in the netcdf file such that they have the same names
as the corresponding dimensions?  Note that this is not in general possible
as some of the coordinate variables are two-dimensional variables (in the
horizontal plane), though for most of the simulations we plan in the near
future I can enforce that the coord vars will have a one to one
correspondence to the dimension vars (i.e. I can enforce that coord vars
are 1D).

Is the ordering of dimensions important?
Is the ordering of coordinate vars important?
Is the naming of dimensions important?
Is the naming of coord vars important?
Can Paraview cope with 2D coord vars?  If so, how does Paraview know which
coordinate var applies to which var?

Thanks very much for your help.

Regards,
Rupert Gladstone

Hi Chuck, Hi Burlen

Thanks for your reply.

I've attached the setup of my mesa installation. I have more options enabled in 
my config than in yours.  May be too much as this frontend has no GPU available.

I'll try a setup with -DVTK_USE_X=OFF as Burlen suggest, but is it possible to 
build paraview GUI with this option ? It is not clear for me.

Rupert,

I can't help you with netcdf files/formats. However, the following two 
items could be of help.

(1) ParaView has a Transform filter that will translate and/or scale 
and/or rotate your datum set.

(2) In the coordinate 3-tuple (x,y,z). if all of your z-values are zero, 
then PV will "come up in a "2D" mode. There is a 2D/3D toggle button 
(button number 3) in the upper left location in each display frame that 
may be of help to you.

Rupert,

Would it be possible for you to send us a sample file and what the list of
VARS you expect to see in the paraview?

Thanks,

Hi Patrick,

Your output shows you enabled some gpu specific drivers, and GLX. I 
think that is going to screw things up for you. Best to disable all of 
them but the ones you specifically need and to explicitly disable glx.

Here is how I configured OSMesa for a Cray

    ../mesa-17.0.2/configure --enable-texture-float --disable-glx
    --disable-dri --disable-egl --disable-gles1 --disable-gles2
    --disable-gbm --disable-driglx-direct --disable-xvmc
    --enable-gallium-osmesa --with-gallium-drivers=swrast,swr
    --prefix=/usr/common/software/ParaView/mesa/17.0.2/

And here is how ParaView is configured on the same system. When building 
ParaView with OSMesa the ParaView GUI should be disabled to prevent 
window system dependencies(X11, Qt etc). Note that there are a number of 
options in play to configure for OSMesa. I've highlighted them in blue 
below. This info is also on the Wiki.

Rupert,

As Aashish said, it might be easier to diagnose the issue if you sent us a file. But if your file is not following the CF or COARDS convention, then the reader will simply interpret the arrays in the file as uniform grids with spacing of 1. This is not likely to conform with the coordinates you want.

The official documentation for the CF convention is maintained here: http://cfconventions.org/. In summary, you specify coordinates by using arrays of the same name as the dimension. So for example if you have a 3D array with dimensions named ?Z?, ?Y?, and ?X?, then you also make a 1D variable named ?X? on the ?X? dimension that has the x coordinate for each grid point in the dimension. Likewise, you have a ?Y? variable on the ?Y? dimension for y coordinates and a ?Z? variable on the ?Z? dimension for the z coordinates.

Or, if you don?t want to mess with your file format, you can do as Sam suggested and transform the data once it is loaded into ParaView.

Is the ordering of dimensions important?

Can Paraview cope with 2D coord vars?  If so, how does Paraview know which coordinate var applies to which var?

Subject: [Paraview] How to save data for selected time range in paraview
Message-ID: <000001d2ce0b$703d18a0$50b749e0$@gmail.com>

Hi,

 

I am using paraview to postprocess the results from openfoam. I am doing a
3D case and thus the cell number is huge. What I want to do is to save data
from ''plot over line'' for a time frame from 23s to 28s. However, the "save
data" option seems to only either save the current time step or all time
steps. 

 

Does anyone know how to save data for selected time range or if someone
could tell me how to load data for a selected time directories? Thanks in
advance.

 

Best regards,

Wilson

Hi all, thanks very much for your replies so far.  I must say I am finding
the Paraview community very helpful.

Having considered my data further, I would be able to make a 1D coordinate
variable for my x and y dimensions but not for my z dimension.  The ocean
model uses a hybrid coordinate which can be transformed into depth, but the
resulting depth coordinate will be spatially varying across my data set.
In other words my z coordinate variable will need to be a 3D variable.
>From my understanding of COARDS and CF this is allowed.  But I think from
your email that Paraview will not be able to associate this 3D z coordinate
variable to another variable (e.g. ocean temperature) for the purposes of
plotting.  At least, not using the Paraview CF interface.  Is that correct?

I don't currently have a handy netcdf file (I have a rather large one).  I
could generate a smaller netcdf file to demonstrate the issue, but I am not
sure it is needed here, as the problem is not that Paraview fails to read
the file as expected, but rather than I am trying to clarify what I can
reasonably expect from Paraview with its current functionality.

Do you have a suggestion for how to read in a (topologically) structured
data set on a rectangular cartesian projection in which the the vertical
coordinate variable varies across all three dimensions?  Should I ask
Paraview to read it in as unstructured data?  I think I saw that Paraview
offers some kind of interface for unstructured data in netcdf files.  Are
the requirements of this documented somewhere?  Or do you still feel that I
need to provide an example netcdf file for you to better understand the
problem?

Thanks again for your help.

Regards,
Rupert

Hi Cory,

TL;DR: I have to manually configure that the high-performance NVidia card is used for ParaView to get rid of problems with the FXAA option.

I notice here that the default-ON option of FXAA is giving problems. When enabled, there is at the beginning a smaller black rectangle in the render view where the axes widget should be. When a 3D geometry is loaded and Apply is clicked, the view becomes totally black. Disabling FXAA will show the geometry without having to restart ParaView.

I have a laptop with an NVidia 840M and an integrated GPU (Intel HD 5500). I have to manually enable the NVidia card for ParaView to get rid of this behaviour, so it looks like the Intel card is at fault.

Interestingly, when the NVidia card is active I can also enable/disable an FXAA option in the NVidia control panel. When I enable it, the screen looks totally wrong, as if everything (menus, buttons, etc.) is anti-aliased.

Best wishes,


Menno Deij - van Rijswijk

Hi Burlen,

I think there is a main concept that I do not understand in building Paraview 
and Mesa as I have also all the wiki pages printed in front of me since the 
begining. It is how to build paraview on a server without GPU _but_ with 
Paraview GUI enabled.
With the Wiki I was able to build Paraview on the workstations (with GPU and 
Paraview GUI set to ON) and on the cluster nodes (No GPU and no GUI for 
paraview). But the setup on a server without GPU and paraview GUI enabled is 
still unclear for me.

I'll try a new Mesa setup with your suggestion below but keeping 
*-DPARAVIEW_BUILD_QT_GUI=ON*

Thanks a lot for all the details you provide is this last answer.

Patrick

	co-processing
Message-ID: <b2424dbb-5ede-27d5-4598-3542dad959c9@be.itu.edu.tr>

Hi All,

I just wonder that is it possible to trigger multiple visualization 
pipeline in the same time with co-processing. The co-processing script 
generator plugin mainly outputs only single pipeline at a time and that 
is fine but what about combining multiple Python script (generated by 
plugin) using higher level Python script to trigger multiple pipelines. 
So, i think that this will be much efficient way to look at different 
part of the data without writing to the disk. I am not sure but somebody 
else might do it before.

Regards,

--ufuk

Hi,

Currently the best way to do this would be to use the Extract Time Steps
filter to extract all of the time steps between 23s and 28s. There is some
active development to be able to choose an active range of time (see
https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/issues/17317) which is
targeted for the PV 5.5 release which is targeted to come out around
November 2017.

Best,
Andy

Hi Ufuk,

Unless I'm not understanding your question correctly, I think you can get
what you want by adding in multiple vtkCPPythonScriptPipelines to your
vtkCPProcessor object in your adaptor. Alternatively if you want to have a
single, master Catalyst script handling other Catalyst scripts you can do
something like the following:
================
import script_a
import script_b
import script_c

def RequestDataDescription(datadescription):
  script_a.RequestDataDescription(datadescription)
  script_b.RequestDataDescription(datadescription)
  script_c.RequestDataDescription(datadescription)

def DoCoProcessing(datadescription):
  script_a.DoCoProcessing(datadescription)
  script_b.DoCoProcessing(datadescription)
  script_c.DoCoProcessing(datadescription)
===================

The first way is the recommended way though as that should be more
efficient by having process 0 read the scripts and broadcasting the script
contents to the other  processes for use. The second method will only do
that for the master script.

Please let me know if this doesn't answer your question.

Cheers,
Andy

Thanks Andy. That is exactly what i am looking for. The broadcasting 
mechanism is not clear to me yet. Do i need to broadcast only the file 
names? Anyway, i will try to implement it and see what is going on there.

Thanks again,

Please reply all to keep the mailing list on the discussion so all can
participate in and benefit from the discussion.

Question 1: Why delete columns? All of the columns can be point aligned
attributes.
Question 2: Are you sure you want a Structured Grid?

Table To Points will give you a simple point cloud. Table to Structured
Grid has the extra requirement that the points in the text file are ordered
regularly to make up a toplogical grid. If that is the case, then in
addition to designating the X, Y and Z columns, you also have to specify
the whole extent so that the filter knows how many cells there are in the
i, j and k dimensions.

Hi Ufuk,

If you create a vtkCPythonScriptPipeline, when you initialize it with the
script file name (which has to be done on each process) everything will be
taken care of with respect to broadcasting the file contents from process 0
to the others. We aren't sophisticated enough to parse the Python script to
see if it imports other scripts that are not part of ParaView (e.g.
paraview.simple) or Python (e.g. sys). That is why I recommended the first
approach as opposed to the second approach above. Depending on the compute
platform and how many MPI processes are in the run the difference may be
negligible but having 100K processes or more trying to access the same file
can seriously slow down an HPC machine.

Cheers,
Andy

I have seen the same thing on my PC with an NVIDIA card and Intel
integrated GPU. Obviously, FXAA isn't working with some Intel
integrated GPUs. I, too, had to specifically enable my NVIDIA card.
But that's what ParaView should ideally be using anyway.

ParaView 5.4.0 RC-2 has some improvements to ParaView's Qt widget for
rendering that *may* improve the situation. That should be out later
today (US east coast time) or tomorrow.

> Interestingly, when the NVidia card is active I can also enable/disable an FXAA option in the NVidia control panel. When I enable it, the screen looks totally wrong, as if everything (menus, buttons, etc.) is anti-aliased.

Ah, I haven't seen that option. Thanks for pointing it out.

Thanks,
Cory

Rupert,

It has been multiple years since I really took a look at the CF convention, so I don?t remember the details of whether it supports varying coordinates across multiple dimensions or whether the ParaView reader supports that. If the ParaView reader is missing some corner of the CF convention, let us know and we can work on that.

In any case, you can displace a 2D or 3D image by a height value that is stored in a field by simply running the ?Warp by Scalar? filter.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] Re: [Paraview] netcdf

Hi all, thanks very much for your replies so far.  I must say I am finding the Paraview community very helpful.
Having considered my data further, I would be able to make a 1D coordinate variable for my x and y dimensions but not for my z dimension.  The ocean model uses a hybrid coordinate which can be transformed into depth, but the resulting depth coordinate will be spatially varying across my data set.  In other words my z coordinate variable will need to be a 3D variable.  From my understanding of COARDS and CF this is allowed.  But I think from your email that Paraview will not be able to associate this 3D z coordinate variable to another variable (e.g. ocean temperature) for the purposes of plotting.  At least, not using the Paraview CF interface.  Is that correct?
I don't currently have a handy netcdf file (I have a rather large one).  I could generate a smaller netcdf file to demonstrate the issue, but I am not sure it is needed here, as the problem is not that Paraview fails to read the file as expected, but rather than I am trying to clarify what I can reasonably expect from Paraview with its current functionality.
Do you have a suggestion for how to read in a (topologically) structured data set on a rectangular cartesian projection in which the the vertical coordinate variable varies across all three dimensions?  Should I ask Paraview to read it in as unstructured data?  I think I saw that Paraview offers some kind of interface for unstructured data in netcdf files.  Are the requirements of this documented somewhere?  Or do you still feel that I need to provide an example netcdf file for you to better understand the problem?
Thanks again for your help.
Regards,
Rupert

Rupert,

As Aashish said, it might be easier to diagnose the issue if you sent us a file. But if your file is not following the CF or COARDS convention, then the reader will simply interpret the arrays in the file as uniform grids with spacing of 1. This is not likely to conform with the coordinates you want.

The official documentation for the CF convention is maintained here: http://cfconventions.org/. In summary, you specify coordinates by using arrays of the same name as the dimension. So for example if you have a 3D array with dimensions named ?Z?, ?Y?, and ?X?, then you also make a 1D variable named ?X? on the ?X? dimension that has the x coordinate for each grid point in the dimension. Likewise, you have a ?Y? variable on the ?Y? dimension for y coordinates and a ?Z? variable on the ?Z? dimension for the z coordinates.

Or, if you don?t want to mess with your file format, you can do as Sam suggested and transform the data once it is loaded into ParaView.

Hi, I have a question about netcdf formats.  I am developing a coupled ice sheet - ocean model.  Currently both models run in the same cartesian coordinate system.  The ice model outputs unstructured .vtu files, which paraview reads just fine.  The ocean model outputs structured netcdf files.  If I naively select the "generic and CF conventions" option when reading the ocean netcdf file then the data display ok, but not to scale.  It seems like the structured fields have been read in just fine, but the coordinate variables have not.  I don't think the netcdf files are CF compliant.  I would like to be able to read in both .vtu files and netcdf files and display the data sets together on the same scale.

Do you know what I need to do to read in the netcdf coordinate vars correctly?  I am hoping that I can simply insert a post-processing step to implement some minor manipulation to the ocean model output files so that Paraview can read them in to scale.  Is it simply a case of renaming the coordinate variables in the netcdf file such that they have the same names as the corresponding dimensions?  Note that this is not in general possible as some of the coordinate variables are two-dimensional variables (in the horizontal plane), though for most of the simulations we plan in the near future I can enforce that the coord vars will have a one to one correspondence to the dimension vars (i.e. I can enforce that coord vars are 1D).

Is the ordering of dimensions important?
Is the ordering of coordinate vars important?
Is the naming of dimensions important?
Is the naming of coord vars important?
Can Paraview cope with 2D coord vars?  If so, how does Paraview know which coordinate var applies to which var?
Thanks very much for your help.

Rupert Gladstone

Rustem,

You can find some of the options described at

http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView:Build_And_Install#ParaView_Settings

For others, each build flag has a brief description in the
CMakeLists.txt file, e.g.,

option(PARAVIEW_BUILD_QT_GUI "Enable ParaView Qt-based client" ON)

The description will appear in a CMake UI (ccmake, cmake-gui) if you
use that for configuration.

HTH,
Cory

Interesting, I hadn't heard of this problem. I don't have an intel
card that reproduces this, but if the new version has the same issue
with FXAA and I can find hardware to debug it I'll be happy to take a
look.

Thanks very much Ken and others.

I just tested the warp by scalar filter (I didn't know about this before)
and it looks like it can do what I need with the vertical coord, like you
suggested.

What I will do is this:
I will modify the netcdf file to add a 1D x and y coord variable with the
same name as the x and y dimensions.  I will add a 3D coord var for z.  If
the Paraview netcdf interface can read this in then great!  If the Paraview
netcdf interface cannot handle the 3D z coord then I will use the warp by
scalar filter to apply the z coord var, and will also let you know in case
you want to modify the functionality.

BTW I found this info about coordinate vars on more than 1 dimension:
http://cfconventions.org/cf-conventions/v1.6.0/cf-conventions.html#_two_dimensional_latitude_longitude_coordinate_variables
I'll try the coordinates attribute as suggested in the link above, and will
send you an example netcdf file that I believe to be consistent with CF if
it doesn't work in Paraview.

Rupert Gladstone

Hi Burlen,

this Mesa setup does not provide libGL requested to build paraview with GUI 
enabled :-(
It is OK for the cluster nodes but not for the frontend where I need this GUI 
even with no GPU installed.

that's the point. this allows you to run without the windowing system or 
GPU on the cluster. Most cluster have neither. If you wanted to provide 
the GUI then I would suggest you have two installs of both ParaView and 
Mesa. One based on OSMesa, the other based on some X11 enabled OpenGL. 
Alternatively you could install only the OSMesa capable pvserver as 
suggested in previous email and direct your users to the ParaView GUI 
enabled binaries that Kitware provides on their web site. The latter is 
what I have been doing.

As an aside, it gets messy when you have two libGL in the same build. 
One need to be very careful about library dependencies. It is possible 
to do this if one is very careful during link time. However as far as I 
know this has not been supported for quite a long time in VTK/ParaView, 
and I think it would require some reorganization of VTK OpernGL classes.

Subject: [Paraview] pvpython vtkMPIController usage? rank is always 0
Message-ID: <CAFM6R5h-tMhBVxnQs7PoSv8h1KW3hdBKT0TOeRiMR9+fY+obTQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
I am trying to use VTK's MPI communication from pvpython, running with
OpenMPI's mpirun. It seems like ParaView hasn't enabled the MPI
capabilities for VTK, although it was compiled from source with
PARAVIEW_USE_MPI=ON and correctly found the system OpenMPI-2.0.0 libraries
and includes.

I am running the short example below with the command "mpirun -n 2 pvpython
test.py". The full output is also attached.
In short, both MPI processes report rank=0 and size=1 and their controller
is a vtkDummyController although I expected rank=0..1, size=2 and a
vtkMPIController.

Is it possible to determine the problem with the given information? Do I
need extra CMake settings besides "PARAVIEW_USE_MPI=ON" to enable MPI for
VTK?
ParaView by itself runs fine in parallel, and I can start several parallel
pvservers using "mpirun -n 16 pvserver".

--- test.py: ---
import vtk

c = vtk.vtkMultiProcessController.GetGlobalController()

print "comm:",type(c)
rank = c.GetLocalProcessId()
print "rank:",rank
size = c.GetNumberOfProcesses()
print "size:",size

if rank == 0:
    ssource = vtk.vtkSphereSource()
    ssource.Update()
    print " 0 sending."
    c.Send(ssource.GetOutput(), 1, 1234)
else:
    sphere = vtk.vtkPolyData()
    print " 1 receiving."
    c.Receive(sphere, 0, 1234)
    print sphere

--- Test run: ---
$ mpirun -n 2 pvpython test.py

size: 1
 0 sending.

Try your script within pvbatch.

pvpython is analogous to the Qt client application, it (usually) is not
part of an MPI execution environment. Either one can connect to an MPI
parallel pvserver.
pvbatch is a python interface that is meant to be run on the server. It is
directly connected to the pvserver.

Note that you can run both the ParaView GUI and  pvpython with MPI in order
to initialize, finalize and use MPI functions but as Dave said, they
should/will always be run with a single MPI process. The argument to run
MPI with either is "--mpi".

I believe you want to use pvbatch for MPI-enabled Python scripts.

Thank you all for suggesting "pvbatch --mpi".
At least, this returns size=2 processes, but the updated test.py (below)
hangs with the following output:

$ mpirun -n 2 pvbatch --mpi test.py
comm: <type 'vtkParallelMPIPython.vtkMPIController'>
rank: 0
size: 2
Process 0

Why is "Process 1" not printed, and why does the program hang instead of
finishing?
The file test.py was simplified to:

import vtk
c = vtk.vtkMultiProcessController.GetGlobalController()
print "comm:",type(c)
rank = c.GetLocalProcessId()
print "rank:",rank
size = c.GetNumberOfProcesses()
print "size:",size
if rank == 0:
  print "Process 0"
else:
  print "Process 1"
c.Finalize()

Thank you!
Ephraim

Run with --symmetric.

Without it, only root node reads the script and it tells the rest of the
nodes what to do via paraview's proxy mechanisms (which take effect only
for vtkSMProxy and subclasses).
With it, every node reads and executes the script and all nodes do their
own parts behind the proxies.

On behalf of the ParaView development community, I am pleased to
announce that binaries and source code for ParaView 5.4.0-RC2 are
available to download from

http://www.paraview.org/download/

There was a slight problem building the Linux binary and the
AcuSolveReaderPlugin, so those are not yet available, but they will be
uploaded as soon as possible. I will reply to this email when they are
available for download.

Please let us know if you run into any problems with this release candidate.

Thank you,

Hey Guys,

I was wondering if there's an example for me to look at for updating values
in the fields of the properties panel. I am writing a Plugin that has the
option of reading in values from a CSV, but I would like to have the values
update in the properties panel... similar to how if you use a probe
location filter, it adjusts (x, y, z) interactivley. Thanks for the help.

Kevin

Thank you, "mpirun -n 2 pvbatch --mpi --symmetric test.py" runs as expected.

But I am now using pure python with properly set library paths. It's a bit
annoying that these pvbatch traps aren't documented in the vtkMPIController
class reference or in
http://www.paraview.org/ParaView3/Doc/Nightly/www/py-doc/. What other
surprises are to be expected when I use pvbatch??

Thank you!
Ephraim

Yes Burlen,  this is exactly what I try to do:
- one build for the nodes whitout GUI as they have no windowing system nor GPU 
(I build this using the wiki documentation)
- one build for the front end with GUI: it has no GPU but a windowing system 
(this is the blocking point at this time)
- one build on the users workstations where a GPU and a windowing system are 
available (this is working too thanks to the wiki documentation)

On the front-end I have a system libGL but too old for Paraview 5 and it is 
requested by other commercial softwares. This is why I try to build a new mesa 
from sources for Paraview. I use the module environment then to set the 
LD_LIBRARY_PATH and PATH order to reach the right libraries and, as strace show, 
it seams to work fine. So I suppose it is a mesa configuration mistake in my build.

May be should I post on the Mesa forum ?

Subject: [Paraview] Rendering during transform filter?
Message-ID: <024688c5-e0c2-2022-82b2-c971fbc31cd6@inria.fr>

Hello,

I'd like to know if it possible to allow rendering, at least a decimated 
version, of a mesh while interactively rotating and translating using 
the transform filter.

Right now I just see a bounding box and the mesh is rendered only when I 
apply the transformation.

I'm using Paraview 5.2.0 from Fedora 25 repositories.

Thanks

-- Nicolas

Hello

What you see is not the actual bounding box of the computed dataset, but
merelly a box widget showing the transformation before it is computed.
You can try to enable "Auto Apply" in settings in order to have the
transform computed when you are moving the box.

Regards,

Mathieu Westphal

We're planning to deprecate and remove xdmf2 this summer. So this will be
less of an issue in a release or two.
That said feel free to submit a merge request and I'll merge it.

Jos?,

You'd need ParaView binaries with OSMesa support if your linux server
doesn't have an X server. While typically, we suggest you build ParaView
from source, for ParaView 5.3, we have uploaded OSMesa capable binaries.

You can download that from here:
http://www.paraview.org/files/v5.3/ParaView-5.3.0-OpenGL2-OSMesa-MPI-Linux-64bit.tar.gz

Subject: [Paraview] VTK classes not found in paraview
Message-ID: <1757247.VQt2Gp1oQS@mu15am33074>

Hello all,

Based on http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK/Examples/Cxx/PolyData/PolyDataToImageData, I am converting polyData surfaces into vtkImage. Now that the process is stable, I would like to integrate the python script created in a paraview pipeline (first as a programmable filter).



However, many vtk classes are not found in Paraview (ether python shell or in programmable filters), such as vtkPolyDataToImageStencil.



Is there a way to have them ? Or is there a way to force Paraview to use the system's VTK and Python ?

Indeed, we could have better descriptions in a number of options.

As far as I know, the VTK_Group_* options are set up by ParaView, so
changing them won't do anything. Ideally, they would be hidden, but it
hasn't been high priority to do so. Just know that you can ignore
them.

VTK_NO_PYTHON_THREADS is documented with the string "Disable Python
Threads support". When ON, it means you will not be able to use Python
threading support.

Best,
Cory

Kevin,

Are you asking how to add a way for your reader to allow the the user to
interactively place a (x,y,z) location? If so, look at "Point Source" [1].
The "Center" property, together with the <PropertyGroup/> XML snippet
should add the interactive widget.

Mathieu,

The file is indeed present, but ParaView is not building VTK's
ImagingStencil module by default, and it is not available in the
official binary.

Dorian,

If you are building ParaView, turn ON the advanced VTK_Group_Imaging
makes vtkPolyDataToImageStencil available in Python scripting.

Rustem,

This indirectly answers your earlier question about VTK_Group_Imaging.

Best,
Cory

Mathieu,

The file is indeed present, but ParaView is not building VTK's ImagingStencil module by default, and it is not available in the official binary.

Dorian,

If you are building ParaView, turn ON the advanced VTK_Group_Imaging makes vtkPolyDataToImageStencil available in Python scripting.

Rustem,

This indirectly answers your earlier question about VTK_Group_Imaging.

Best,
Cory

Subject: [Paraview] Option to automatically choose a contrasting axis color?
Message-ID: <3CF17A53-FD47-4828-9E95-D66EC65E2A4D@ornl.gov>

We recently added an option in our ParaView-based application to automatically switch the color of the orientation axes, axes grid, and color scale text so that it contrasts with the background color. This saves a lot of mouse clicks when changing between light and dark backgrounds. Is there any interest in having this or a similar option inside ParaView?

Thanks,
Steven Hahn

OK. to accomplish this, first do a Mesa build configured as 
follows(glx+software rendering)

    ../mesa-17.0.6/configure --enable-texture-float --enable-glx
    --disable-dri --disable-egl --disable-gles1 --disable-gles2
    --disable-gbm --disable-driglx-direct --disable-xvmc
    --with-gallium-drivers=swrast,swr
    --prefix=/work/apps/mesa/17.0.6-x11-swr

make sure ParaView can find it, and configure ParaView as follows

    export
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/work/apps/mesa/17.0.6-x11-swr/lib/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    cmake -DOPENGL_INCLUDE_DIR=/work/apps/mesa/17.0.6-x11-swr/include
    -DOPENGL_gl_LIBRARY=/work/apps/mesa/17.0.6-x11-swr/lib/libGL.so
    ~/work/ParaView/

when you run ParaView the "help/about" dialog should report VMWare Mesa 
17.0.6 Gallium on llvmpipe.

Message-ID: <E744507DCB192B45930918B1A2FF1031290A4F40@petmail.WIN.PET.HW.AC.UK>

Hi everyone;

Until now I was using "OpenFOAM" software which has a dedicated reader available in paraview to read the output files.

In parallel, I am working with a software called "Gerris". Both the software's use a collocated grid arrangement with field variables located at the cell centres. Unfortunately, Gerris writes an output in "vtk" format yet the data is always interpolated to the cell nodes which I don't want. I am just interested in the cell centre data.

As an alternative, I tried to write the output in ASCII format, with information regarding the cell centre co-ordinates (X, Y, Z) and velocity field data (U, V which are primary variables) at specific time intervals.
I realize it is not straight forward to visualize the ASCII data in paraview nor are there any readily available converters that do the transformation from a ASCII to VTK as per my knowledge.

Can anyone guide me here,

For reference, attached you will find my ASCII data output which I would like to visualise.

Thanks;
SaiD

Hi again,



When using classes from the VTK_Group_Imaging in a programmable filter, I am having serious issues getting the data back from the filter.

I have setup a simple pipeline to demonstrate the issue: gist.github.com : polyData2vtkImageData.pvsm<https://gist.github.com/d-vogel/ee0433e2e7a7fae25e6ff85c36099d14>



The issue I'm facing seem similar to this previous thread<http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2017-January/038966.html> however the latter is with compiled plugins:

- nothing is rendered

- 'information' tab reports data present

- saving the data to file from the script and reopen it gives the expected result.



Am I using the wrong way to output data from the filter or is this a bug ?



Regards,

Dorian Vogel

Steven,

How does this interact with color palettes? Currently, we are indeed
missing a feature where annotation color for orientation axes, is not not
linked to annotation color by default. But once it is, wouldn't it be
easier to just change the palette?

it is a frequent error to forget to set the RequestInformationScript of the ProgrammableFilter.

I have quickly hacked your code to make it work and give it here as an example to be polished further.

try to load the following python script.

SaiD,

The VTK legacy file format, which supports an ASCII option, is fairly
straightforward. You may even get lucky and be able to adapt the file
you attached (I haven't looked at it) by simply adding some header
information. Documentation for that format is located at
http://www.vtk.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/file-formats.pdf

HTH,
Cory

Jean,

I did not know about the RequestInformationScript, thank you very much.

I also discovered that it can be set through the GUI thanks to the cog in the 'Properties' panel.

Here's a new example for filling up properties with default values read
from file meta-data.

Is anyone else seeing "gibberish" on the "Color Map Editor"? I am on OS 
X 10.10.5 (Yosemite) running an AMD 7950 GPU. I did not notice this on RC1.

I haven't noticed it, but then I am not sure I have access to Yosemite.
Mike, can  you confirm that RC1 definitely didn't have this issue? I can
then try to look at the code to see if I can spot the potential problem.

We recently added an option in our ParaView-based application to automatically switch the color of the orientation axes, axes grid, and color scale text so that it contrasts with the background color. This saves a lot of mouse clicks when changing between light and dark backgrounds. Is there any interest in having this or a similar option inside ParaView?

Subject: [Paraview] Questions about using ParaViem in a cluster
Message-ID: <CAE=GJrbr2cyOC+YzdaV-gw_BM0o-Lrjdv8PGwUBx4T8jjBoBqA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi!

I've recently gained acess to a cluster with paraview in it and I have some
questions.

The cluster has no graphics. Only CPU. We use off-screen rendering and
reverse-connection

I'd like to run pvserver in the cluster and have the OpenGL windows defined
in the .PVX file open in my local machine so I can create 6 views in a
Cubemap shape.

So far I've tried the following:

*1)* mpirun -np 1024 /sw/apps/suse/shared/paraview/5.2/intel/bin/pvserver
-rc --use-offscreen-rendering  --client-host=${IP} cubemap.pvx

The output:

Client connected.

=====================================================================   BAD
TERMINATION OF ONE OF YOUR APPLICATION PROCESSES
EXIT CODE: 11
[...]

*2) *mpirun -np 6 /sw/apps/suse/shared/paraview/5.2/intel/bin/pvserver -rc
--use-offscreen-rendering  --client-host=${IP} cubemap.pvx

The output: "Client Connected."

No OpenGL windows are open thou.

*3) *mpirun -np 6 /sw/apps/suse/shared/paraview/5.2/intel/bin/pvdataserver
-rc --use-offscreen-rendering  --client-host=${IP} cubemap.pvx  *(renderserver
in local machine with same .pvx  and number of processes being used)*


The output: off-screenrendering can't be used with dataserver

*4) *mpirun -np 6 /sw/apps/suse/shared/paraview/5.2/intel/bin/pvdataserver
-rc --client-host=${IP} cubemap.pvx *(renderserver in local machine with
same .pvx and number of processes being used)*

The output: ParaView tries to conect at port 53939 in node rank = 0 and
crashes

Questions:

In order to use .PVX files I have to run with -np = number of machines
defined in the .pvx file? If so, why is that?

Is it possible to do what I am trying to?

Should I use paraview installer  with MPI or not?

Using off-screen rendering, my local machine does any type of graphic work?
Or is it only like an "image stream" of the data rendered in the server?

Subject: [Paraview] Complete Multipass Rendering Example available?
Message-ID: <CAGwt4EzeCZ48A5gFoSw0p_cVEKmhbH8T1mDndLfRxoW_p6uTSw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,
I am trying to understand and implement the full parallel multipass
rendering as it is performed by ParaView.
The solution could work with or without IceT, as long as translucent
geometry and volume rendering is supported.

Two of the examples I am aware of are
http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK/MultiPass_Rendering_With_IceT, which is quite
well documentet, but doesn't work for translucent geometry, and
http://www.vtk.org/gitweb?p=VTK.git;a=blob;f=Filters/Parallel/Testing/Cxx/DistributedDataRenderPass.cxx,
which is just the code without documentation but supports transparency to
some degree.

Is the second example sufficiently complete to render all cases correctly
that are dealt with in ParaView? Or what are the limitations of this
example?

Thank you so much,
Mark

Dear all

In my understanding, plot over line looks at the data right at the line and
plots them. What if, I wanted to draw multiple lines, parallel to each
other, average the data out, and then plot this average data over the line?

I am trying to plot data using the plot over time filter on a selection.
THe x axis goes from 0 to 500, and I want it to go to 0 to 5. Using "bottom

I just want x axis to display 0 to 5. The transform filter is also grayed
out. How can I go about it?

The two statements are little confusing. If your cluster has no graphics
output, where are you intending the 6 views to be displayed? The pvx-based
multiview setup is designed for cases where the server can present windows
for each rank to display the same scene from different cameras -- think
immersive environments as follows:

[image: Inline image 1]


> 2) mpirun -np 6 /sw/apps/suse/shared/paraview/5.2/intel/bin/pvserver -rc
--use-offscreen-rendering  --client-host=${IP} cubemap.pvx
> The output: "Client Connected."
> No OpenGL windows are open thou.

Since you're using "--use-offscreen-rendering", that's what pvserver is
doing -- everything's offscreen. You won't see any windows. In general, I
don't think there's much point to running in immersive mode i.e. pvx
together with offscreen.

> In order to use .PVX files I have to run with -np = number of machines
defined in the .pvx file? If so, why is that?

In general, yes. There are ways around it to use separate dataserver and
render server, but I personally have never used pvx in
client-data-server-render-server mode.

> Is it possible to do what I am trying to?

I am confused what you're intention is. If you elaborate on your use-case,
maybe we can suggest a different approach.

> Using off-screen rendering, my local machine does any type of graphic
work? Or is it only like an "image stream" of the data rendered in the
server?

Offscreen simply means if and when that process needs to do rendering, it
won't do that onscreen, instead in a offscreen frame buffer. Whether that
process does the rendering or not is not controlled by offscreen, but
instead "Remote Render Threshold" in Settings and the size of the geometry
being rendered. In client-server configurations, if geometry size is larger
than the remote-render-threshold the ParaVIew renders on the server
processes and delivers images to the client. If geometry size is less than
the remote-render-threshold, then is will deliver geometry to the client
and render it locally.

Hope that helps,
Utkarsh

Dear all,

I have x- and y-coordinates of discrete particles with their displacements
imported into Paraview. I successfully used the Delaunay 2D filter to
display the displacement contours.

I would like to display the strains and stresses of these discrete points.
My guess is to use the compute derivates filter to do this task. However,
several tries did not yield any results.

I would appreciate some help in this direction.

Message-ID: <CALX_V3ivDJL-xFU8=v1Nxg9it6yTNm7PduvjWUuWq+DtHO-tPQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I would like to know if it is possible to build ParaView 5.3.0 (Client as
well as Server / Batch etc...) in one go with off-screen / on-screen, GPU
and software support. (i.e 4 different combinations possible)

My understanding is that EGL is a step forward in allowing this as it
should provide the ability to use the GPU in off-screen contexts ?

I know that the current ParaView 5.3.0 installation supports both CPU and
GPU rendering by swapping out the OpenGL2 libs at runtime (the MESA OpenGL
libs are put in the mesa subfolder).

However, I haven't figured out if it is possible to have off-screen and
on-screen rendering activated / de-activated at runtime ? And if so, is it
only for the software rendering capability or for the hardware rendering
capability as well ?

If it is possible to have all 4 possibilities selectable at runtime, what
are the build options to enable this ?

Even if I need to do separate builds and swap out the libs at runtime that
would be fine !

Thanks !
Jacques

Jacques,

Here's a quick summary of modes available currently, with their
requirements and features supported. A and B do not need any special build,
while all other modes do.

ParaView 5.3 configuration Requires X-server Supports H/W rendering Supports
Software Rendering
Yes No Yes No Yes No
A Default ? ? ?
B Default with Mesa libGL ? ? ?
C OSMesa only ? ? ?
D OSMesa + Mesa libGL ? ? ? ?
E EGL only ? ? ?
A. assuming libGL is provided by GPU vendor
B. uses same build as A, simply change LD_LIBRARY_PATH to load libGL
provided Mesa3D
C. Special build ParaView with VTK_OPENGL_HAS_OSMESA=ON, VTK_USE_X=OFF
D. Special build of ParaView with VTK_OPENGL_HAS_OSMESA=ON, VTK_USE_X=ON
and OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY set to point to libGL from same Mesa build proviing
libOSMesa.
E. Special build of ParaView with VTK_USE_OFFSCREEN_EGL=ON.

We have plans to add support for another mode where you can use EGL + libGL
(similar to D but with H/W rendering support). That may happen later this
year.

Hope that helps.

Thanks Utkarsh,

For Build D, since you build with VTK_USE_X=ON, can you use pvbatch on a
machine that doesn't have an X server?
If so, is there anything to do in particular at runtime?

Also, is it possible to build the paraview client gui with VTK_USE_X=OFF ?

Does Build E allow to build the paraview client gui  ?

Best,
Jacques

Just start pvbatch with "--use-offscreen-rendering" command line argument.

> Also, is it possible to build the paraview client gui with VTK_USE_X=OFF ?

No. VTK_USE_X is currently needed for the GUI. Although as I am
thinking of this, with Qt 5, we can get rid of this requirement.
You'll still need to X to use the GUI and for building Qt, but
ParaView should not directly depend on X (unless I am missing
something). Please report an issue for this, if you don't mind. We
should investigate this.

> Does Build E allow to build the paraview client gui  ?

Not currently. It's on the TODO list to support (hopefully by 5.5).

Thanks a lot Burlen, all is running fine now with this setup for mesa on the 
front-end.
With Paraview, I had to add some parameters for ffmpeg-3.3 libraries that were

Hello again,

I still have one issue remaining that I couldn't solve:

I added the RequestInformation Sript to my programmable filter, which dynamically sets the WHOLE_EXTENT attribute so that it corresponds to the extent of the input (polyData) and everything renders properly.

However, if I save the state like this, and reload it in a fresh session, the RequestInformation script reports self.GetInputDataObject(0,0).GetBounds() for be (1.0, -1.0, 1.0, -1.0, 1.0, -1.0). And then of course the output of the filter is not rendered.



I assume the mistake here is to query self.GetInputDataObject in the RequestInformation, because what I understand is, when loading, all RequestInformation scripts are called before any requestData. Thus, the upstream data doesn't exist.



If all of this is true, how can I access the upstream WHOLE_EXTENT from the informationRequest script to propagate the value in my filter ?



You can find attached an example save state.



Best regards,

it is a frequent error to forget to set the RequestInformationScript of the ProgrammableFilter.

I have quickly hacked your code to make it work and give it here as an example to be polished further.

try to load the following python script.

I recently downloaded Paraview (version 5.4) for Windows -10. I was able to
install the program successfully without any error messages. All default
settings were selected during installation.

I am unable to display any image. When I open the software, I am unable to
display any images. All I see is a blank dark screen. I am attaching a PDF
file which shows the details of the screen shots.

I am very new to Paraview and will appreciate any help on how to get the
software working on my windows laptop.



Thank you.

Hi AD,

Welcome to ParaView! I'm sorry to see that your initial experience was
suboptimal.

Thank you for providing the extensive information about your system. I
can see that ParaView is using Intel hardware for graphics. We have
had other reports of people with Intel graphics hardware on Windows 10
running into this same problem with the 5.4.0 release candidates, and
I can reproduce it on my Dell laptop with integrated Intel graphics
and Windows 10.

Do you happen to have an NVIDIA or ATI graphics accelerator on this
machine? If so, the immediate solution is to change the graphics
driver settings so that the other graphics accelerator is used.

Hope that helps,
Cory

Thanks for the tip, is there no other possibility than editing the state file ? I might want to create a custom filter later on, which does not seem possible with this solution.

Dear Cory:

I appreciate your prompt response and also your confirmation that my issue
was not an isolated case.

I do not have immediate access to an alternate graphics accelerator. So I
decided to download version 5.2 (32-bit) for Windows. And so far things seem
to be working fine.

Thank you.

AD

Hi all,


I am trying to build PVReaders in OpenFOAM 
(applications/utilities/postProcessing/graphics/PVReaders)

I got an error which reads fatal error: vtkCommonCoreModule.h included 
in vtkDataArraySelection.h while building vtkPVReaders.

I searched Paraview-v5.3.0 source tree but failed to find 
vtkCommonCoreModule.h.

That file was not found in even VTK-7.1.1.

Where can I find the header file?


Regards.

SeongMo

SeongMo,

The file vtkCommonCoreModule.h is created during
configuration/building and exists in the ParaView build directory. I
don't know the particulars of building PVReaders in OpenFOAM, but my
guess is you need to point it to a ParaView build directory instead of
the source directory.

HTH,
Cory

Hi  guys


I'm having a few issues setting up ParaView - the installation appears to proceed smoothly until I start the application and then I am greeted with a series of error messages of the form:


Failed to load libEGL (The specified module could not be found.)QWindowsEGLStaticContext::create: Failed to load and resolve libEGL functionsFailed to load opengl32sw.dll (The specified module could not be found.)Failed to load and resolve WGL/OpenGL functionsFailed to load libEGL (The specified module could not be found.)QWindowsEGLStaticContext::create: Failed to load and resolve libEGL functionsFailed to load opengl32sw.dll (The specified module could not be found.)Failed to load and resolve WGL/OpenGL functionsQOpenGLWidget: Failed to create contextcomposeAndFlush: makeCurrent() failedcomposeAndFlush: makeCurrent() failedcomposeAndFlush: makeCurrent() failedcomposeAndFlush: makeCurrent() failedcomposeAndFlush: makeCurrent() failedcomposeAndFlush: makeCurrent() failedcomposeAndFlush: makeCurrent() failedcomposeAndFlush: makeCurrent() failedcomposeAndFlush: makeCurrent() failed


I have simply downloaded the ParaView binary installer and proceeded through the installation. Has anyone encountered this problem/know how to resolve it? I am probably missing something very basic, but would greatly appreciate any help.


Many thanks

Ben

So I have one more question. I have added a dropdown box in order to switch
between objects in my MB DataSet. Is it the same kind of Idea where I need
to Update the metadata in order for the values of the block information to
change in the panel again? Here are pictures of how it is currently. (Also,
when I print out the "current" values to the command line, they are correct
(they just aren't correct in the properties panel).

Thanks,

Kevin

P.S. - you can see that Current Object Differs, but the other information
remains the same)

Hi Ben,

Thanks for your report. I believe we are missing at least one DLL in
the Windows package. I have reported an issue here:

https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview-superbuild/issues/53

I'm not sure if it will make the ParaView 5.4.0 release coming out soon.

Thanks,
Cory

Subject: [Paraview] extract time-series structured data to numpy 3D array
Message-ID: <CAC-oNP5jXqMed_o8nBmfCzg2_agaDm-1-2aksU83hbYxtwN89g@mail.gmail.com>

Paraview Developers,

I have timeseries, structured multiblock, density data in the ensight
format. For example purposes, say 1000 timesteps and 40 blocks. I would
like to export all timesteps for only block#=12, IJK_index=(12,14,1). A
common example of doing this is when treating a cell as a virtual
pressure-tap. The problem I'm having is verifying that time is actually
incrementing, and that the reshape from the 1D vtk array to a 3D numpy
array is correct. The following is the core of the script I am using to
perform this analysis.

#####################################################################
import paraview.simple as pv
pv._DisableFirstRenderCameraReset()
import paraview.servermanager as pvs
import paraview.numpy_support as pvn
import numpy as np

# hard-coded path to ensight case file
ensight_case_path = '/path/to/ensight.case' # obviously my script has a
valid path

# Read in the ensight data
ensightcase = pv.EnSightReader(CaseFileName=ensight_case_path)
ensightcase.PointArrays = ['Density']

# loop over each timestep
for t in ensightcase.TimestepValues:
    ensightcase.UpdatePipeline(time=t) # TODO: verify that this indeed
updates time

    # bring the data to the client
    ensightcase_data = pvs.Fetch(ensightcase)

    # get the 12th index block (zero-based index, so actually the 13th
block)
    block = ensightcase_data.GetBlock(12)

    # get the i,j,k dimensions (used next to reshape the numpy array)
    shape = block.GetDimensions()

    # "convert" the vtkFloatArray to numpy. comes in 1D, so reshape
according to i,j,k
    # TODO: verify that passing vtk's `GetDimensions` to numpy's `reshape`
has the desired effect
    block12_array3d =
pvn.vtk_to_numpy(block.GetPointData().GetArray('Density')).reshape(shape)

    # my real script does stuff with the data. for this example, just print
it
    print("time = ", t, "\tdensity = ", block12_array3d[12,14,1])
#####################################################################

This is a simple problem, but I'm not finding any documentation to backup
my two assumptions. Given the importance of this script to my analysis, I
wanted to request conformation from the community before going forward. I
have quite a lot of data to analysis, so any performance suggestions are
also welcome.

Thank you,

Ben Orr

L?o,

Let me preface my saying this is not the most tested configuration, you may
have to experiment a bit, but here's a possible setup.

1. run pvdataserver foo.pvx on our cluster (M ranks, where M >= 6)
2. run pvrenderserver with 6 ranks on your desktop. Provide the pvx file to
pvrenderservers as well
3. Now connect ParaView client to this dataserver/render-server config.

Morning,

I am trying to use ParaView Web on Mac using Paraview v5.4 by following the guide in the following link:

http://www.paraview.org/ParaView3/Doc/Nightly/www/js-doc/index.html#!/guide/quick_start <http://www.paraview.org/ParaView3/Doc/Nightly/www/js-doc/index.html#!/guide/quick_start>

The problem is that the Python script 'pv_web_visualizer.py' is not included in the release for Mac. 

The following is the call to the file pv_web_visualizer.py which does not exist.

$ cd /Applications/paraview.app/Contents
$ ./bin/pvpython Python/paraview/web/pv_web_visualizer.py  \
           --content www                                   \
           --data-dir /path-to-share/                      \
           --port 8080 &
$ open http://localhost:8080/apps/Visualizer
Has anyone come across this issue?

Thanks for any help.

Marco.

Message-ID: <f5380aba-3087-caad-f774-3e42a4cde9b1@legi.grenoble-inp.fr>

I've not completly solved our migration from Paraview 4.1 to paraview 5.3...

On a RedHat 6 server, with AMD firepro W7000 GPU I've compiled successfully 
paraview. But launching the application returns:
vtkXOpenGLRenderWindow (0x2671a80): GL version 2.1 with the gpu_shader4 
extension is not supported by your graphics driver but is required for the new 
OpenGL rendering backend. Please update your OpenGL driver. If you are using 
Mesa please make sure you have version 10.6.5 or later and make sure your driver 
in Mesa supports OpenGL 3.2.

This server uses mesa-libGL-11.0.7-4.el6.x86_64 (from ELrepo) wich is > 10.6.5 
(requested for paraview in this message) but a glxinfo returns:

I've checked with ldd that the loaded openGL library is the good one:

....
bash-4.1$ rpm -qf /usr/lib64/libGL.so.1
mesa-libGL-11.0.7-4.el6.x86_64

I'm launching paraview via vncviewer on this node.

So which minimal mesa version is required for paraview 5.3 ?

Thanks

That would be the correct link:

Did you manage to find that page using a search engine or from a link on
our Web site? If from a link do you mind pointing that page as we should
fix it.

Kevin,

Before we discuss how this can be done (or can't be done), let's try
to figure out what we want here.

Is the user ever expected to change "Scene ID", "Object Index" etc.,
the parameters that you are expecting to change their value when the
"Current Object" is changed, or are they just for information purposes
only?

Ok, Some Information will probably stay the same, such as the Scene
Identification, Object Index, etc.

However, I have the plugin set up to perform a vtkExtractBlock when
selecting the object in the MB dataset I want to adjust. (These are truth
coordinates for SVMs and Convolutional Neural Nets) So if I am to adjust
the position of the object within the SceneID, I would like for those new
coordinates to be dispalyed in the Properties Panel.

But most of the properties will probably be information only.

Subject: [Paraview] Catalyst dlopen issues with OpenGL2 support for
 off-screen Mesa
References: <1489188960.14532.1.camel@free.fr>
Message-ID: <1495671484.31674.2.camel@free.fr>

Hello,

I reproduced the issue described 2 months ago relative to detection of OSMesa
OpenGL2 support using dynamically loaded shared libraries on another machine.

I had reproduced this issue on Debian-9 based systems, but not with the
preconfigured Mesa/OSMesa from Arch Linux. Recently, I had other issues with the
 packaged library on Arch (Mesa 17.1.0, including both off-screen and on-screen
drivers), as glGetString and a few other symbols were not found.

So I recompiled Mesa for off-screen mode, using the recommendations from the
ParaView Wiki (with the packaged LLVM 4.0), and encounter the following error
again when starting Catalyst:

--------------------------------
ERROR: In
/home/yvan/src/ParaView/VTK/Rendering/OpenGL2/vtkOpenGLRenderWindow.cxx, line
831

vtkOSOpenGLRenderWindow (0x72e3c00): GL version 2.1 with the gpu_shader4
extension is not supported by your graphics driver but is required fo
r the new OpenGL rendering backend. Please update your OpenGL driver. If you are
using Mesa please make sure you have version 10.6.5 or later 
and make sure your driver in Mesa supports OpenGL 3.2.
--------------------------------

Trying to force usage of OpenSWR (using "export GALLIUM_DRIVER=swr") I have
another error:

--------------------------------
SWR detected AVX2

SWR library load failure: /home/yvan/opt/osmesa/lib/libswrAVX2.so: undefined
symbol: _glapi_tls_Dispatch
--------------------------------

So this seems quite reproducible on various systems, and both with LLVM 3.9 or
LLVM 4, Mesa 13 or 17.

When linking ParaView (Catalyst) normally (rather than linking them with a
smaller module loaded as a plugin with dlopen), both the default LLVMpipe and
OpenSwr errors dissapear, and things work fine

Does anybody have an idea what I may be missing when loading with dlopen ?

Best regards,

  Yvan

Kevin,

I don't think Properties Panel is best suited for what you want to do.
Properties Panel is intended for a specific purpose: setting
parameters on a vtkObject subclass. When the proxy for such a
VTKObject is first created, ParaView has mechanism to get information
from server side and set default values for properties (that's what
the example I shared demonstrates). After that point, the Properties
panel doesn't automatically change values i.e. if "Current Object" is
changed, ParaView won't pass that to your vtkClass until Apply is hit.
And even after that, ParaView won't ask your vtkClass to get new
values for other properties line Scene ID etc. All the "dynamic'
components us see on the Panel are developed using information locally
available to the UI via domains, data information etc. They don't go
the VTKObject.

You have think in terms of what are attributes on the algorithm that
control it's execution and what's information shown to the user.
Attributes/parameters go on the Properties panel. Things that are
showing information about it's current status are generally relegated
to an "inspector" panel e.g. multiblock inspector, data information
panel etc. Now you can create a dummy property, tell paraview to
create a custom widget for it and then make that custom widget behave
like an inspector -- if you want to get creative, that is.

Subject: [Paraview] Issue with Python path variable change from ver 5.2
	onward
Message-ID: <CAEhu9hB3s9W6oUTB+P0ek54JiQjaB60UVWgZwS+m8rUYjBZYpA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I've encountered a minor, but annoying issue (for me, at least) when using
Python in Paraview (installed from binaries on Windows).  I noticed that
since version 5.2, the Paraview-related paths are appended to the end of
the system PYTHONPATH variable, instead of inserted at the beginning.  For
instance:


*v5.1.2*

>>> import sys

>>> for p in sys.path:

... print p

...

D:\Program Files\ParaView 5.1.2\lib\paraview-5.1\site-packages\vtk

D:\Program Files\ParaView 5.1.2\lib\paraview-5.1\site-packages <- Paraview
VTK code

D:\Program Files\ParaView 5.1.2\lib\paraview-5.1

D:\Program Files\ParaView 5.1.2\bin

...

D:\Anaconda2\Lib\site-packages <- original system PYTHONPATH paths

etc...

D:\Program Files\ParaView 5.1.2\bin\python27.zip

D:\Program Files\ParaView 5.1.2\bin\DLLs

D:\Program Files\ParaView 5.1.2\bin\lib

This is a problem for me because I like to use the Python Programmable
Filter a lot, but now whenever I import VTK, it will first look for the
version of VTK on my system, rather than the one used by Paraview, which
leads to conflict errors.

I know this can be fixed by running the Python Shell and manipulating the
PYTHONPATH variable from there, but I'd have to do that every time I open
Paraview, which is pretty cumbersome.  Is there a way to change this
behavior?  Could it be a changed back in future versions or was there a
reason for this change?

Thanks,
Evan Kao

Hi,

Is there any mean to assign a texture in a python programmable filter ?

I have my programmable filter which have two inputs :
- a unstructured grid of 3D points with texture coordinates
- an image dataset coming from an ImageReader which reads a sequence of images

I would like to apply the current timestep image as a texture on my 3D model.

Regards,

Bruno LE HYARIC.

Message-ID: <2F8BA25CC0B82C4DB6756F8F663E6DB3540CEDF8@CITESMBX3.ad.uillinois.edu>

Hello,

I am trying to read a set of spatially decomposed Exodus files as described here: http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/ParaView_Readers_and_Parallel_Data_Distribution

The ParaView client is being run on my laptop and the server on a remote visualization cluster. I am connecting to the server via a client-server connection.

When I do so I get the error:

ERROR: In /projects/pvdev/common/pv-source/v4.1.0_test/VTK/Common/DataModel/vtkDataObjectTree.cxx, line 377
vtkMultiBlockDataSet (0x7d96490): Structure does not match. You must use CopyStructure before calling this method.

multiple times. I running pvserver on one and many processes, each time getting the same error.

Any advice would be much appreciated.

Thanks very much,

Louis

Hi Louis,

It looks like you are using ParaView 4.1, which is fairly old at this
point. Could you try a more recent version such as 5.3 or 5.2 and see
if the problem persists?

Thanks, and best regards,
Cory

Hi Patrick,

On a RedHat 6 server, with AMD firepro W7000 GPU

...

> I'm launching paraview via vncviewer on this node.


If you're running via VNC then unfortunately you won't be using the GPU
(unless you get more creative with something like VirtualGL).  You're only
going to be able to use the CPU based renderer in Mesa.



> If you are using Mesa please make sure you have version 10.6.5 or later

>

So, Mesa got OpenGL 3.2 support in 10.6.5, but not all of the drivers
implemented it until much later.



> OpenGL renderer string: Gallium 0.4 on llvmpipe (LLVM 3.6, 256 bits)
>

llvmpipe is Mesa's software renderer



> OpenGL version string: 2.1 Mesa 11.0.7
>

Older versions of Mesa may have supported OpenGL 3.2 at it's core but the
llvmpipe driver still took a while to catch up.


So which minimal mesa version is required for paraview 5.3 ?
>

It wasn't until Mesa 12 that OpenGL 3.2 was properly supported and reported
by all Mesa drivers.  With some versions of 11, though, it works *enough*
that you can fake it by exporting the environment variable
GL_VERSION_OVERRIDE=3.2, so give that a try.  If you instead want to just
use the linux binaries from paraview.org, we build those on EL6 and include
a very recent copy of mesa with it that you can make paraview use with:

paraview --mesa-swr

That instructs ParaView to use it's own copy of Mesa and the OpenSWR
parallel CPU rasterizer.

Hi Cory,

I tried running the ParaView 5.4 client on a login node on the cluster using X11 window forwarding and got this error message:

Dear all

Is there a way to manipulate the x axis labels/data? My x axis data goes
from 0.5 to 20, which I want to display on the scatter plot as 0 to 1. Can
I directly do this in paraview?

Thanks a lot!

Sorry for my late response.

Although there is a way of doing this in ParaView's application level
Python interface, it is not recommended. This is because when ParaView is
run in client-server mode, the application level Python interface runs on
the client whereas the data resides on the server. So you could use the
Programmable Filter with something like this to access the field data:

inputs[0].FieldData

where the pipeline may look like this:

reader -> Programmable Filter

If you are running client only, this would work (not recommended as a
workflow though because of the client-server issue):

from vtk.numpy_interface import dataset_adapter as dsa
reader_vtk = reader.GetClientSideObject()
output = dsa.WrapDataObject(reader_vtk.GetOutput())
field_data = output.FieldData

Best,
-berk

Louis,

[adding list back in]

I'm afraid I am not an expert in the Exodus file format nor in how
ParaView reads it. However, if you have a set of files you can share
(with just me if necessary), I can take a quick look and see if
anything jumps out at me.

Thanks,
Cory

Subject: [Paraview] passing a numpy array to a programmable filter
Message-ID: <CAKQvD9R7xso2v31FWcqLX9XE9aSY1963KSxhC4Bf=MJX--o=Vg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,
     I'm writing a pvbatch script in which I need to perform some
calculations on paraview objects (provided by a quite complex pipeline that
starts from reading vtu files and processing through reseamplewithdataset
filter and other filter manipulations) by using a programmable filter to
which I must pass some information that in the main script is representable
as a quite big float numpy ndarray. This array comes from another numerical
process that cannot be included in the same programmable filter.

I don't know how to pass this numpy array to the programmable filter.
Probably I could use the Parameters property of the programmable filter
but, if I correctly understand the use of this feature, the whole array
should be converted to a very big string (or more than one) and then
reconverted back to float values inside the PF.

I've tried to create a vtkTable object in the main script using the
following lines:

T = vtkTable()
array_vtk = numpy_support.numpy_to_vtk(array)
array_vtk.SetName("AAA")
T.AddColumn(array_vtk)

and this seems to generate a vtkTable object (by printing type(T) I get
"<type 'vtkCommonDataModelPython.vtkTable'> " ) but this is not a Paraview
class object so when I pass this as an input argument to the Programmable
Filter I obviously get the error: "vtkCommonDataModelPython.vtkTable'
object has no attribute 'SMProxy'.



Is there any way to do this? I've thought about using
servermanager.CreateProxy() but I don't know how to use it and if it could
help.

Of course the easy solution could be to write the array to the disk from
the main script and to read it from the  disk inside the programmable
filter, but I would like to avoid passing through the disk writing that
could be too much slow.

Any help would be appreciated.
Thank you in advance

Alessandro

Louis,

I can confirm the same error message you are seeing. A quick look in
the debugger at the source of the error message wasn't sufficient to
figure out what might be going on I'm afraid.

Message-ID: <60821.78.160.106.199.1495874147.squirrel@webmail.be.itu.edu.tr>

Hi,

I am looking for an example C++ code that demonstrates definition of cell
data in vtkStructuredGrid. I have a code that defined fields as point data
but I would like to convert it to cell representation. As I know that cell
data does not need to extra ghost point along the edges in
vtkMultiPieceDataSet inside of vtkMultiBlockDataSet. Please correct me if
i am wrong. So, definition of the fields as cell data will improve my code
performance because I am doing lots of collective communications to create
extra ghost regions along the boundaries and as you guess it reduces the
overall performance of my code.

Regards,

Message-ID: <d768e841dd2d5587175452c856cd53d0@mail.uni-kiel.de>

 

Hey,

I have a python script that opens a Legacy VTK file that contains two
scalar arrays of the same length (real and imaginary part of a wave
function) and then adjusts the camera settings, representation and
color. My transfer functions seem to be ignored and I just get full
opacity and black color. Running the script inside the GUI's python
shell gives the same result, but when I then change the array under
Display->Coloring to the other one and back again. everything looks as
expected. So my question is: What is this GUI element doing beyond
"GetRepresentation(reader, view).ColorArrayName = ['POINTS', arrayname]"
and how can I do the same within the python script?

Kind regards

Subject: [Paraview] How to output forces over time?
Message-ID: <02df01d2d853$6b222250$416666f0$@gmail.com>

Hi,

 

I am using paraview to postprocess the results from OpenFoam. I am able to
calculate the drag and lift forces on a fixed box by integrating pressure
over the box surface. Now I would like to output the time history of the of
the forces. How can I achieve that? What I have done is to select the row of
forces generated in the spread sheet view and then use "File->save data->
Write All Time Steps" . However, the output file only give me the results of
p, U, normals, etc. without the forces I want. 

 

Does anyone know the solution to this problem?

 

Many thanks,

Wilson

Hi Chuck

thanks for all these details. Finaly I had to install a dedicated version of 
mesa as the update to 11.0.7 from ELrepo was breaking one of our licensed 
software (ANSYS) and I had to roll back to 10.4.3.:-[
I've compiled mesa-17.0.4 (with llvm-4.0.0, libdrm-2.4.70, xcb-proto-1.12, 
pthread-stubs-0.3, libXau-1.0.8, libxcb-1.12, libxshmfence-1.2 prerequisites) 
and all seams running fine now with hardware rendering (?). In my VNC session:
$ glxinfo
....
direct rendering: Yes
...
OpenGL renderer string: Gallium 0.4 on llvmpipe (LLVM 4.0, 256 bits)
OpenGL version string: 3.0 Mesa 17.0.4
....

so am I using the GPU (direct rendering is set to yes) or the CPU (if llvmpipe 
is software rendering) ?

Hi Richard,

Since you didn't specify the version you are using I'm using 5.4-RC3 for
this answer.  I loaded a dataset and ran the Python Trace (Tools -> Start
Trace) to find out what it is doing.  Here is the python script that was
generated from changing what the dataset was colored by.


# get active source.

canex2 = GetActiveSource()


# get active view

renderView1 = GetActiveViewOrCreate('RenderView')

# uncomment following to set a specific view size

# renderView1.ViewSize = [1330, 670]


# get display properties

canex2Display = GetDisplayProperties(canex2, view=renderView1)


# set scalar coloring

ColorBy(canex2Display, ('POINTS', 'VEL', 'Magnitude'))


# get color transfer function/color map for 'vtkBlockColors'

vtkBlockColorsLUT = GetColorTransferFunction('vtkBlockColors')


# Hide the scalar bar for this color map if no visible data is colored by it.

HideScalarBarIfNotNeeded(vtkBlockColorsLUT, renderView1)


# rescale color and/or opacity maps used to include current data range

canex2Display.RescaleTransferFunctionToDataRange(True, False)


# show color bar/color legend

canex2Display.SetScalarBarVisibility(renderView1, True)


# get color transfer function/color map for 'VEL'

vELLUT = GetColorTransferFunction('VEL')


It is hiding the scalar bar for vtkBlockColors since that is what the data
used to be colored by.  I think your problem will be solved by using the
GetDisplayProperties and ColorBy functions rather than setting
ColorArrayName.

HTH,
Shawn

Subject: [Paraview] Overriding the maximal cylinder source resolution
Message-ID: <06b74055-eb22-e51f-0646-8c661aca1dad@gmx.com>

Hello everyone,

I have exported the paraview trace into the attached script that
generates a cylinder source without caps, triangulates and saves an STL
file.

I have noticed that the cylinder resolution can be prescribed to any
number in the python script:

~~~
    # create a new 'Cylinder'
    cylinder1 = Cylinder()

    # Properties modified on cylinder1 
    cylinder1.Resolution = 100000
~~~

And this number is reported by the print command as well

~~~
    print(cylinder1.Resolution)
~~~

However, the actual resolution of the cylinder source never exceeds the
number 512. This I have figured out after manually inspecting the number
of triangles in the 'cylinder.stl' file generated by the attached script.

I have browsed the VTK code as well, but I could not find the point
where the maximal cylinder source resolution is restricted to 512.

My question is: can I somehow (in python, or in VTK) override the
resolution that is actually then applied to the cylinder? I am using
paraview version 4.4.0. Does it work in a newer paraview version?

Kind Regards,

Tomislav

Hello All,

My name is Hayk, I'm phd student and working on visualization of scientific
data.
I'm interested in ParaViewWeb component and used it on my desktop server.
My goal is to make multi-user support service with this.
I have a couple of questions which will be very helpful.

Q1: Can I run and use ParaVieWeb in virtual environment without having a
real graphical processing unit(GPU)?
Q2: Which is the best way for deploying ParaViewWev as a service.

Thanks in advice,
Hayk

Q1: Yes but you will need to use open-swr or llvm-pipe (extra args with
distributed binaries if you have X) or build ParaView with OSMesa (no need
to build the Qt part)
Q2: http://kitware.github.io/paraviewweb/docs/multi_user_setup.html

Sorry for the very short answer but I have to go. ;-)

Hi Tomislav,

I find restriction on the resolution number of a cyliner source in
vtkCylinderSource.h, that is:
  vtkSetClampMacro(Resolution,int,2,VTK_CELL_SIZE).
This macro amounts to saying that the resolution is restricted to a
range between 2 and VTK_CELL_SIZE(=512). Hence, I think it difficult
to override.

In order to increase the resolution of the cylinder, one thing you can
try is to apply the loop subdivision filter after triangulating it.

Thanks,
yoshimi

Hello

One way to go would be to copy (or subclass) vtkCylinderSource and built it
as a Plugin for paraview.
Easy if you are building ParaView yourself, more complex otherwise.

Another way would be to write your own cylinder source in a Python
Programmable Source,
not easy but you will be able to use your new source with the binary
release of ParaView

Mathieu Westphal

The best option would be to indeed move the Python code to "get" the array
from the the other numerical process to the Programmable Filter's script
itself, rather than doing it in the batch script.

The do-at-your-own-peril option, which may work if you don't intend to run
the batch script in parallel or client-server modes,  would be to pass the
array via a global variable in some module that both the batch script and
the programmable filter script import. Since the Python interpreter is
shared between the two, and modules don't get imported twice, you should be
able to set the variable in one and access it in another.

Subject: [Paraview] Linux, ParaView and poor fonts
Message-ID: <149663b83f874d0cbc435e6d40e3d5a3@ES01AMSNLNT.srn.sandia.gov>

ParaView 5.*, our current version of ParaView, now uses system fonts on Linux.  This is how all applications are moving, and ParaView (and Emacs) is on top of the curve.  Unfortunately, if your font files aren't setup correctly, these fonts won't anti-alias, and your fonts will be hard to read and look stark and small.  This seems to be random, and I haven't been able to figure out why  anti-aliasing is on or off.  Anyway, here is how to check and fix it.

To check if you are anti-antialiasing, open ParaView, and zoom your screen %400.  On Gnome, this can be done by Applications/  Accessories/ KMag.  Zoom in until zoom is 1:4.

If you are not anti-aliasing, the title bar will look like this, and you should fix your account as described below:
[cid:image001.png at 01D2D979.3B7836D0]

If you are anti-aliasing, the title bar will look like this, and you are good:
[cid:image002.png at 01D2D979.3B7836D0]


If you are not anti-aliasing, you can add a ~/.fonts.conf file to your home directory with the following commands in the body of the file.  Note that .fonts.conf files have been deprecated, but it is the only way I could find to get fonts to alias.

<?xml version='1.0'?>
<!DOCTYPE fontconfig SYSTEM 'fonts.dtd'>

Message-ID: <CADHSJjAvBi8p2HqXMP1wZs9UkSrdZU-=67O7iG7FFCbReuT4iw@mail.gmail.com>

Folks,

Final ParaView 5.4 should be tagged and released in the next few days.
This may be a good time to discuss dropping support for legacy
components.

I'd like to propose dropping support for legacy rendering backend in
lieu of the what we call the OpenGL2 rendering backend that requires
OpenGL 3.2 or newer. We have been using the newer backend by default
since 5.0 (January 2016) and is indeed the most tested and used
rendering backend since then.

If there are strong reasons to continue supporting the legacy backend
beyond 5.4 please make us aware before June 30, 2017. One can always
use older versions of ParaView, if required. For the most part, we
have already stopped doing any development, including maintenance
fixes for the legacy rendering backend.

How is the legacy back end related to --mesa-llvm?  We still use this switch frequently on small clusters that use system mesa for rendering.

Message-ID: <CA+8EhJU_PCEpyCTVjqHaroD1UV3m-_SzrOD6O2h_c0bUsidcGA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi there, I'm trying to save some data computed with calculator and
integratevariables pipeline within a coprocessing session. For this
purpose, I've been trying the following  procedure:

# create a new 'Integrate Variables'
...
1: my_calc = IntegrateVariables(Input=calculator1)
2: data = servermanager.Fetch(my_calc)
3: my_value = data.GetPointData().GetArray("ComputedData").GetValue(0)
4: fout = open("lift.dat","a")
5: fout.write("%5.2f" % my_value)
...

but it's not working and the error seems to be occuring at line 3. Any idea?

Thanks

Message-ID: <CA+8EhJX1643gn5J6Ftbm_kaKZm4ZdpXV4m47=grkCOYruY2OMw@mail.gmail.com>

Just to report a bug detected in version 5.4.0-RC3


1) If a load a set of parallel data stored in xdmf file format
2) extract surface
3) apply a clip to isolate one of the surface
4) color this surface with a variable, let's say, pressure
and
5) save the coprocessing script using the "autoscale" for the variable used
to color the surface clipped, Catalyst will crash when running in parallel.

I've tested it a ton of times and it only happen with the clip filter
specifically. In my case, I was running a flow around a sphere and the
clipped data (using the sphere tool) was the sphere itself where I'd like
to color with the pressure but I only managed to make a valid python script
after selecting a solid color for the sphere...

the basica pipeline was

1) load the xdmf
2) create ghost cells
3) merge blocks
4) extract surface
5) clip (the sphere)
6) stream tracer
7) tube (colored with velocity)

In the 5th step, I've tried:

a). Color with pressure and save with autoscale enabled. It crashes
b). Color with pressure and save with autoscale disabled. It works fine
c). Color with a solid color and using autoscale for the tube colored with
velocity. It works fine

I hope it helps to reproduce the problem

Regards

Renato

I'd suggest not using `Fetch` in co-processing. On rank 0, you can
simply do this:

my_calc = IntegrateVariables(Input=calculator1)
Update(my_calc)
data = my_calc.GetClientSideObject().GetOutputDataObject(0)

The above works because `IntegrateVariables` produces output on rank 0
and in co-processing mode, we don't run in client-server, as a result
you have access to VTK algorithms locally.

Thank you Utkarsh, I appreciate the consideration for a ticket.

Do you see any workaround (even ugly) ? It seems strange to me that there is absolutely no way to do that. I believe we might find a way deep into VTK...

Hmm. I could have sworn that at one point the frequency was displayed in the properties panel next to the Mode Shape slider bar. Maybe we lost that during one of our properties panel redesigns. (Or maybe I'm misremembering.)

I don't think so.  I have gone back to 4.4.0.  ParaView has the same controls now as then.
