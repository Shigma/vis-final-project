Subject: [Paraview] Sum two data array in paraview
Message-ID: <CABbbvusSmARUANvZP9GEGw3kCrhpobiWoVZKvozCuysuwXaF5Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hello

I want to use calculator or Python shell to sum two data arrays in paraview.
In the calculator:
At time dt =2, I create an array: result1 = pressure* 2.
For next animation time, dt = 4:
I create an array: result2 = pressure*4
What I find that the result1 array has changed at time step =4.
How I can retain original result1 array when I change the animation time to
dt=4.

This way I want to take sum of result1 and result2 at two different time
steps.

How we can achieve it in paraview?

Best regards
Jay Reno

As there was no real answer to your problem,
and the workaround is not satisfying,
I guess it's a bug and not a misuse.

Could you report the bug in the bugtracker ?

Message-ID: <70000E8CF211F942AD1DB39696F1CED50753CA70@EUSMTVPR-MBX001.siemens-adgt.local>

Hello,

I am trying to make a simple animation using a large number (~3000) of tecplot 2D slices (each slice is a tecplot file). Each slice is a snapshot of a flow simulation..I have a couple of simple python calculators in the pipeline apart from annotations.

I have two questions:


1.      The issue is that Paraview creates the animation for around 1600 slices when it is a matter of simply rendering the images but this reduces to ~ 1000 when there are pipeline operations (like my python calculator). After updating to the screen, each time-step, it freezes at a particular one and continues. The playback looks good from timestep 1 to 1600 and after that (i.e. 1600-end) there is no more motion (picture frozen to time-step 1600).



2.      What is the best way to speed up rendering this animation? I enabled multicore (in version 4.0) but then the rendering takes twice the time. Would appreciate any advice on what the best way to do this.


I've tried offscreen rendering as well as an older version of Paraview (v 4.0) but no good result. I am using v 4.3.1.

Many thanks,

Sandeep.

Message-ID: <D14227F5.1B8F6%kmorel@sandia.gov>

If I understand your question correctly, you are basically trying to take arrays computed from two different time steps and then add them together. This is (intentionally made) difficult in ParaView because ParaView makes sure that the time from the data is consistent across all data sets. Things would get pretty confusing otherwise.

That said, you should be able to hack what you want using the "Temporal Shift Scale" filter, which can mangle the time of a data set to be different than the global time. The following procedure should work.

1. Starting with your data loaded into ParaView. Let's say the data is coming from a pipeline object named OriginalData.
2. Set ParaView to be at animation time 2.
3. Add the calculator filter and create your result1 array.
4. Add the Temporal Shift Scale filter directly to OriginalData (not the calculator filter). Shift the time by 2.
5. Add a calculator filter to the Temporal Shift Scale filter and create the result2 array.
6. Use the Append Attributes filter with the two calculator filters as input.
7. You can then take the sum of result1 and result2 with the data from Append Attributes.

Dear Paraview folks,

It seems there is a mistake in the Paraview User's Guide at the end of the
section Python Calculator.

To create a multi-component field from multiple scalar fields, hstack used
to work before Paraview 4.2.0.

But since Paraview 4.2.0, we must use numpy.column_stack. This change may
have been caused by the great work done in 4.2.0 to be able to use numpy
arrays as vtk arrays with automatic conversion from numpy to vtk and
inversely.

Using hstack will create a dataset with many components (number of nodes
times the number of field in hstack).

For instance, create a sphere source with default properties.

In Paraview 4.1.0, use this formula to create the same field as Normals:
hstack((Normals[:,0], Normals[:,1], Normals[:,2]))

In Paraview 4.2.0 and 4.3.1, if you use numpy.hstack((Normals[:,0],
Normals[:,1], Normals[:,2])), you will get a field with 150 components,
since the default sphere has 50 points. And it may lead to a memory
oversize for a source with thousands points.

In Paraview 4.2.0 and 4.3.1, the following formula gives the wanted result:
numpy.column_stack((Normals[:,0], Normals[:,1], Normals[:,2]))

Note that you must change the name of the result, otherwise the number of
components is not updated between two different formulas. This might be a
bug.

I have not found where the latex documentation is. Is it available
somewhere as a git repository? What is the policy on contributing to it?

Dear all,
I have the same problem since some weeks. When I try to create a longer 
animation the rendering stops after about 100 steps and the same view is 
shown by changing the time (using vtu files). Sandeep's error 
description sounds very similar. I'm using only standard filters, 
perhaps Contour is quite expensive. And perhaps my models are slightly 
bigger (about 1.6 million cells and a similar number of points).
Some further remarks: I get the problem when I do the playback or even 
when I create an animation. I do not get the problem when I'm using no 
filters (except the read filter). If I remove after the occurrence of 
the error the Contour filter, there seems to be a layer over the output. 
During turning the model I can see it, when I release the mouse it 
disappears...
Any idea?
I'm using 4.3.1 but I have the same with 4.2 and 4.1
Martin

Thank you Berk for your answer.

You are right, make_vector is even mentioned in some parts of the Paraview
Guide that I have read. But my first need was to create a 9-component field
to be able to use the Tensor Glyph filter, so I still have to use numpy.

To reproduce the bug:
- create a source sphere
- create a filter Python Calculator with this formula:
numpy.column_stack((Normals[:,0], Normals[:,1], Normals[:,2])) and Apply.
- display the field result
- in the toolbar, click on Magnitude to see the components: X, Y, Z. It is
OK.
- edit the formula of the Python Calculator with a formula that changes the
number of components: numpy.column_stack((Normals[:,0], Normals[:,1],
Normals[:,2], Normals[:,0])) and Apply without changing the name of the
result field.
- in the toolbar, click on Magnitude to see the components: X, Y, Z. It is
not OK.
- in the panel Information, the field "result" has 4 components. It is OK.
- edit the name of the result field to call it result2 and Apply.
- display the field result2, and click on Magnitude to see the components:
0, 1, 2, 3. It is OK.

So it seems to be a bug in the drop down button to select the component
that is not updated when the formula changes the number of components on an
existing field.

Message-ID: <68AC123ECB4AC54DB8876E4D6A3EED9659F5BDA5@mn05svcwem002.atk.com>

Folks,
I am new to paraview and while I am making some progress with the tool, I have not been able to figure out a few things....
I get a lot of data in plot3D format.
The data in question is in the "function" file
Paraview simply sees these as function1, function2 etc
Is there someplace I can actually specify text for those?
Thanks
-Andy

Christoph,

I am working on putting in up on the Gitlab instance. It needs some minor
cleanups before I can make it public. It should happen within the next
week, if not sooner.

Hi Roman,

The VTK version that ParaView uses does change often, but to build
against ParaView's VTK, the best result will still be obtained from
building VTK independently, then building ParaView and any other
dependencies, like ITK, against that version of VTK. To find the
version of VTK that ParaView is using,

  cd ~/src/ParaView
  git submodule status VTK

The process to build will then be something like

  cd ~/bin/VTK
  cmake ~/src/VTK
  make

  cd ~/bin/ITK
  cmake -DVTK_DIR=~/bin/VTK -DModule_ITKVtkGlue=ON ~/src/ITK
  make

  cd ~/bin/ParaView
  cmake -DVTK_DIR=~/bin/VTK -DUSE_EXTERNAL_VTK:BOOL=ON ~/src/ParaView

HTH,
Matt

Hello!
I try to use Paraview for visualization of a geophysical data. I need to create AMR file with some levels (some meshes), where we want to place raw files.

Can you help me? Can you send me a simple example of such structure for Paraview?

Thank you in advance.

I'm struggling to find the block indices that match a given block name from

Hey Tatyana,

So you are asking for some help on how to create AMR? Is that right.

Unfortunately, there is not a super easy way to rename an array. You have
to use the Programmable Filter with something like this:

from vtk.numpy_interface import dataset_adapter as dsa
itr = dsa.MultiCompositeDataIterator([inputs[0], output])
for inp, opt in itr:
    opt.PointData.append(inp.PointData['function1'], "my function")

Best,

Hey, Aashish, 

Yes - I need some help on how to create AMR with some our raw files?

For example, 
first raw file: 256*256*256, unsigned 16-bit, little Endian, x - fastest, mesh 0:50:12750
second raw: 256*256*256, unsigned 16-bit, little Endian, x - fastest, mesh 0:5:1275

Thank you in advance. 
Tatyana.

but in this case, it complains as "ImportError: No module named site". I 
think that it might be realted with the definition of PYTHONHOME 
environment variable and somehow it causes problem in Python side. 
Anyway, i am using Enthought, Canopy (64bit) for python implementation 
under Mac OS and i also tried to add PYTHONPATH to shell script to 
define Canopy related modules

export 
PYTHONPATH="/Applications/Canopy.app/appdata/canopy-1.4.1.1975.macosx-x86_64/Canopy.app/Contents/lib/python2.7:$PYTHONPATH"

but again i am getting following error which could be related with the 
wrong definition of environment variables or their orders because sys 
has base_prefix method (tested under ipython)

...
...
     from sysconfig import get_config_var
   File 
"/Applications/Canopy.app/appdata/canopy-1.4.1.1975.macosx-x86_64/Canopy.app/Contents/lib/python2.7/sysconfig.py", 
line 95, in <module>
     _BASE_PREFIX = os.path.normpath(sys.base_prefix)
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'base_prefix'

So, i just wonder that is there anybody that run these examples under 
MacOS along with Enthought, Canopy? Is there any custom script to run 
the example? Do you suggest me to go directly to Linux (i.e. Centos 
etc.) to solve these problems.

Thanks,

Hello!

I tried applying the "Glyph" filter, but still the negative values aren't
being considered. It considers only the magnitude.

Can somebody please explain in detail how I should go about this? Please
have a look at the .vtk file I have attached above, I am stuck at this
point.

Thank you

Hi,

I haven't tried any of this on a Mac so it's possible that something is
amiss there. Have you tried the same examples with the full build of
ParaView with Catalyst enabled as well as the Fortran adaptor? If you build
the examples with testing enabled you should be able to run ctest to verify
that things are working properly. It's not a very thorough test but should
run the sample executable along with a Catalyst Python script to generate
some kind of output.

If none of that works I'd suggest trying it on a Linux machine to see
what's going on there.

Regards,
Andy

Thanks for your suggestions Andy. When you are mentioning about the 
"full build of ParaView with Catalyst enabled as well as the Fortran 
adaptor", are you suggesting to install Paraview from the source? By the 
way, how can i enable test in cmake? Thanks again.

Regards,

A Glyph can be oriented along the direction of the vector. Wouldn't
that be taking negative values into consideration?

Yes, it will be easier to diagnose what's going with this if you have
you're own build of ParaView from source.

For testing, when building the Catalyst examples make sure that
BUILD_TESTING is set to ON.

Andy

Hi Utkarsh,
thank you for publishing the source. I had some troubles to get it
compiling, there are many LaTeX packages used, that are not provided as
openSuse RPMs. That will need some more time.
There are plenty CMake warnings about CMP0046. I have not yet
investigated them further.

Find attached a small fix for a small glitch, at least in the published
PDF it was broken.

Bye
Christoph

Message-ID: <C8921E2F87E8024BBD6C59CB07C0F47D28DCC217@AAI-EXCH-MBX1.campus.unibe.ch>

Hi,
I have a question about the use of vtk filter. At page 91 of the paraview manual included in the binaries download,  it is suggested to make a copy of the input (
input_copy = inputs[0].NewInstance()
input_copy.UnRegister(None)
input_copy.ShallowCopy(inputs[0].VTKObject) ) , but the reference is to the previous  version of VTK. Does this still hold for VTK 6?
In the paraview guide available for download  under "documentation", this issue is not mentioned (but the guide is also shorter). I have been using the filter without making copy of the input and I haven't the impression of memory leaks in my code

Hi Rohit,

I had a look at your data file and I don't understand where your problem 
is. I can visualize the X and Y component of velocity and get seemingly 
correct results (i.e. X and Y have negative and positive values). The 
magnitude of the velocity vector is as expected everywhere positive.

Also the Glyph filter produces reasonable results with the default 
settings (e.g. the arrows can be colored by X or Y component with 
positive and negative values or by magnitude with only positive values).

So my question would be: What exactly do you want to visualize?

-Armin

Subject: [Paraview] plot contour in ParaView
Message-ID: <A77611F4-BFF4-47DC-A121-E033BDEDDFAA@gatech.edu>

Hi,

I am trying to post-processing my simulation results from LAMMPS using ParaView. I first converted dump file into ensight file format using pizza.py. The script is attached behind. 

import sys
from dump import dump
from ensight import ensight
d=dump("dump.peri");
d.map(1,"id",2,"type",3,"x",4,"y",5,"z",6,"damage",7,"vx",8,"vy",9,"vz");
e=ensight(d);
e.one("disk","damage","Damage","y","Position_y","x","Position_x","z","Postion_z","vy","VY","vx","VX","vz","VZ?)

Then, I imported the .case file into ParaView. Now I have the coordinate, damage scalar, and velocity components for each point. I wonder how can I use the Contour filter in ParaView to plot contours? When I try to do that, I got only one coloring option called Solid Color. How can I use damage or velocity as the coloring options?

Thanks,
Yifei

Make sure you have "Compute Scalars" option checked on the
"Properties" panel for the Contour filter.

Hi, 

I just double checked. I did check the "Compute Scalars" option.

If you can share a sample dataset to illustrate the problem, it may help.

Should I use the vtkHierarchicalBoxDataSet?
How does such set look like for Paraview? 
Can you give me an example?

Subject: [Paraview] Slices generation with pvpython
Message-ID: <DFFD2576A2FBA14888A66E54C1BE8D88FD19FD6D@DM10EX21.dm.ducati.prv>

Hi everybody,

I have a problem when I tried to implement an automated procedure for postprocessing analysis.
I have wrote and run (from command prompt) the following script with pvpython.exe.

If the variable numberofslice is <= 20 the script run well, but if I try to generate 40 slides for example, after the twenty one, for a couple of slide, the image is blank. After that, the following slides are generated in a correct manner.

I have tried to change the py with different type of algorithm ( for, while, if ) but the problem remain.

Have you any ideas for resolve this strange issue??


Thanks for your support

Subject: [Paraview] problem in installing Paraview from source in MacOS
Message-ID: <5524F02C.5080705@be.itu.edu.tr>

Hi,

I had a problem in the installation of Paraview fro the source. The make 
command gives error (at the end of the message) related with "QSQLITE 
driver". The code compiles without any problem until this step (63%) and 
i just wonder about the solution. I also found couple of threads related 
with this issue but i could not solve it. I also tried to install 
libqt4-sql-sqlite using macport but it did not help. By the way, i am 
using paraview version 4.3.1 along with Enthought Canopy (1.4.1) and 
MacOS 10.10.2.

Regards,

--ufuk

It looks like the error is happening when building the examples.  You might
be able to get around it by rerunning CMake and turning the examples off
unless you need the examples in your build.

cd /path/to/build/dir
cmake -DBUILD_EXAMPLES:BOOL=OFF .

HTH,

It's not clear what's doing on with out a sample dataset to try this
out with. Can you share a dataset that will help reproduce the
problem?

I am correct that your dataset is just a point-cloud or am I missing
something? If it is a point cloud, how are you contouring it, in the
first place? The contour filter cannot be applied to a point cloud.

Livia,

With VTK 6, there's no need create a shallow copy of the input.

BTW, the ParaView Guide (http://www.paraview.org/paraview-guide/) is
indeed the latest irrespective of the page count :).

Are you looking to get the block names in a Programmable Filter, or in
pvpython script?

Hi Utkarsh - Do you all update PDF from time to time or is it the same as
when it was first released? If you do update it, is there a way to find
that out (aside from downloading it again every so often). Thanks! -- Adam

It's not updated yet, but we have plans to setup a "builder" to build
a new version of the PDF everytime the LaTeX files are updated. It
isn't in place yet, however.

We can put a revision number of sorts, on the PDF to know that the PDF
online is different from what you downloaded before. I am not sure how
to setup notifications that a new revision is available, however.

Patrick,

Simply check the "Prevent Seam" checkbox on the Properties panel for
the "TextureMapToSphere" filter and the seam will disappear.

Hi,
When you apply "Prevent Seam", it solves the problem but
then you get a mirrored copy of the texture.
Have a look to the continents displayed.
Thanks

Ah....nvm :), this is indeed a bug. Feel free to report using the URL
Christophe pointed to. One way to solve this would be create a new
source that duplicates the points along the edge to avoid that
interpolation between the texture coordinates at the seam.

Thanks

Message-ID: <55255B07.7060200@nasa.gov>

Hi. I'm trying to build paraview from source. It almost completes, but I 
get: (paths removed for simplicity)

$ make
...
Scanning dependencies of target pvbatch
[100%] Building CXX object 
CommandLineExecutables/CMakeFiles/pvbatch.dir/pvbatch.cxx.o

I tried "make paraview" to avoid building pvbatch (which I don't really 
need), but I got the same error.

Any help is appreciated. Thanks.

Antoine,

Here's a sample script you can use in a Programmable Filter (since
it's easier in Programmable Filter than pvpython).

That is correct. ParaView is not really designed for "editing" data in
this way. One applies filters to change/modify data.

It is point cloud. What data type could the contour filter apply to? Is it possible to convert dump files from LAMMPS to this type of data?

Thanks for your kindly help.

The name of the plugin is the default name for the target used. If you
want to create another target, you can indeed use add_dependecies[1]
to add dependency on the new target to the target created by
add_paraview_plugin().

Yifei,

Contouring as an operation doesn't make much sense for point clouds.
The question would be what is your end goal? What information do you
want to extract from the point could? Maybe I can suggestion
alternative operations that can help you achieve that.

Yes, this is indeed not supported. Feel free to add a bug report to
the paraview bug tracker (http://paraview.org/Bug).

If you're going this route, make sure you have the latest ParaView
(from git/master) which includes this fix [1]

Mind sharing a sample dataset? That'll make things easier.

Thanks for your reply. My goal is to plot stress contour for my simulation results. It seems to me that when I use pizza.py to convert dump file from LAMMPS into other file types, the data is always point data (coordinate and value at a point). So I wonder if I could convert the dump file into certain file types ParaView could use to plot contours?

As far as I know, in MATLAB I could use griddata function to interpolate scattered data (point data in 2D). Then use contourf function to generate contours. I wonder if ParaView provides similar functions like griddata to convert the input data, then apply the contour filter?

Thanks,
Yifei

Which version of ParaView are you using? With 4.3.1, I get the following:

<snip>

# get color transfer function/color map for 'RTData'
rTDataLUT = GetColorTransferFunction('RTData')

# get color legend/bar for rTDataLUT in view renderView1
rTDataLUTColorBar = GetScalarBar(rTDataLUT, renderView1)

# Properties modified on rTDataLUTColorBar
rTDataLUTColorBar.TitleColor = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
rTDataLUTColorBar.LabelColor = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]

Yifei,

Ideally, you want to put it out as an 10x10x20 Uniform Rectilinear
Grid, vtkImageData (since that's what it seems to be). For information
on what vtkImageData looks like, refer to Chapter 3 from The ParaView
Guide which can be downloaded from here[1].

Are you building the documentation? If you are, I'd suggest not building
that. Also, any of the reader plugins are not needed for Catalyst (ie.
AnalyzeNIfTIReaderWriter) so you can disable them.

Andy

I want to take the mean EQPS from the can.exo dataset, and plot it over time.  Any idea how I can do this?

Thanks,

Alan

hey, my name is Kevin.

I am currently running into a problem with building against my system's
protobuf libraries for 2.6.0. I have been able to successfully build
against 2.4.1.

However, I now receive this:


vtkPVMessage.proto:65:14: Message extensions cannot have required fields.

has anyone run into this problem? Might there be a work around?

No. i am not building documentation. I also set off the plugin as you 
suggest but the make command also gives same error for other plugins 
such as ArrowGlyph and EyeDomeLightingView. So, i could disable most of 
them except plugins related with Catalyst but i am not sure. Does it 
effect the main capabilities (such as making vectors etc.) of the 
Paraview? Those feature can be also used by in-situ visualization.

Thanks,

This displays the picture on one half of the sphere, and a mirror picture on the other half.

This is not what I (and probably Patrick) would like to have.

Yes, we already had a follow on conversation on the mailing list about it :).

Hello

I have one more doubt that I haven't found a detailed solution to online.
With the same vtk file (uploaded above), can I view the streamlines
distribution?
I know it has to do with the 'Stream Tracer' filter, but which parameters
do I use?

Thank you!

Hi Alan,

I think the quickest way to do it is to use the Integrate Variables filter
which should pop up a spreadsheet view. Then go to cell data in the
spreadsheet view and select the only cell and then do Plot Selection Over
Time. I'm sure Utkarsh or Ken knows how to do it in at least 2 less steps
though :).

Regards,
Andy

Doesn't seem so. Looks like ParaView will need changes for 2.6.0.
Searching around, seems like the changes necessary for it are probably
minor[1].

An attempt at this:

    https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/merge_requests/52

This won't verify it works with 2.6.0 since we don't have any buildbot
machines with 2.6.0, so if you could test that this branch works for
you, that'd be great. Thanks,

Message-ID: <D14BEC96.1BD4E%kmorel@sandia.gov>

The easiest way "should" be to use the plot over time filter's internal ability to give you the average of everything it is plotting. Right now to do that is more awkward than it should be, so you have to do as least as many steps as Andy's solution. But here is a solution.

1. Open the Find Data dialog
2. Make a selection that selects everything (e.g. ID is >= 0)
3. Click the "Plot Selection Over Time" button
4. In the resulting plot, turn off all variables and then turn on the AVG(EQPS) series

Note that this would collapse to one step (apply a filter) if bugs 0014978 and 0014945 were implemented. I suggest giving these a high priority. Bug 0014978 should be really easy to implement. Bug 0014945 is going to take more time, but it is really important to make all plot-over-time functionality useful.

So I have a project where I am trying to setup the PV install directory so
I can link my personal builds against the ParaView and VTK Libraries. And
it seems in order for this to work properly, I need the ParaViewConfig and
VTKConfig files to be present in the install directory. However, they just
get thrown into the Build directory. Is there a way to configure the files
so that the output goes into the install directory? or is this just
ill-advised?

Thanks,

Kevin E. Dean.

Hi,

You'll want to enable PARAVIEW_INSTALL_DEVELOPMENT_FILES in the CMake
config of your ParaView build to have it install development files there.

Andy

Dear,
    I am a user of ParaviewWeb. 
    The color rendered by ParaviewWeb is inconsistenet with the one specified in the .ply file. For example, we specify the red color in the ply file, but the scene shows blue. 
    What's more, the color is not the same in different installed versions. For example, we specify the red color in the ply file, the scene shows red in version Paraview 4.1.0, but the scene shows blue in version Paraview 4.2.0.
    Thanks for early reply.

Note that this is currently only tested/supported on Unix based

	representation
Message-ID: <CAFBPiv5EW3ZN5T2sv-C7rPT6rWSxw2VyDnJHd9SLPVzu2oezaQ@mail.gmail.com>

Good afternoon:

I am just beginning to use Paraview, and I'm using it to plot a 3D current
scalar field, with x,y,z being the coordinates of a point in space, while
the forth column value represents the intensity of current passing through
that point. My input file is .csv.

After I have tetrahedralized my points, the figure show up in the plotting
window perfectly with surface, point or any other representations except
VOLUME. I can adjust color together with alpha values, however, as soon as
I switch to 'volume', everything just disappears. I've also tried the same
thing on all platforms (Mac, linux, Windows), but the problem is not solved.

I wonder what's causing this problem? Should I used a different input file
format other than .csv? It seems what I am doing is really simple compared
with paraview's capability. I have also checked the archives but could not
find any solution to this...

I really appreciate your help!

Best Regards
Yufei

Ofosu,

Can you try the attached patch? You'll need to apply it in the VTK sub
directory. I suspect Xdmf is accidentally including the wrong zlib
header (using system version rather than the one built by
VTK/ParaView).

Thanks

You cannot volume render data coming in from a CSV file. If you want
to sned me a sample CSV, I can send you a Programmable Source code
than will produce a volume renderable dataset.

Subject: [Paraview] default_servers.pvsc question
Message-ID: <D14DA62F.223AB%Richard.C.Angelini.CIV@mail.mil>

Question about the default_servers.pvsc file?..

I have this in my host profile:

  <Server name=?My System" resource="csrc://127.0.0.1">
    <CommandStartup>
      <Options>
<Option name="SSHLOC" label="Local SSH Command" save="true">
 <File default="/usr/local/bin/ssh"/>
</Option>

So, when the GUI pops up, the user has an opportunity to change the path to ssh.   But, rather than hard-coding the default value, or presenting blank field and have the user put in the correct path, is it possible to query the user?s environment and find `which ssh` and substitute in that value??

Subject: [Paraview] Error when connecting to pvserver (pv 4.3.1)
Message-ID: <AFA761C5-5F1F-418D-AB08-E8F93FABD5C7@aia.rwth-aachen.de>

Hi,

I just installed PV 4.3.1 from source as I need to compile some custom plugins. Using the GUI client in a standalone fashion is no problem and everything works as expected. However, I?ve had difficulties when trying to connect to a pvserver instance.

The server dies with the following error messages:
#######################################
Waiting for client...
Connection URL: cs://aia257:11111
Accepting connection(s): aia257:11111
Client connected.
Warning: In /home/mic/.pool/.src/ParaView-v4.3.1-source/ParaViewCore/ClientServerCore/Rendering/vtkPVClientServerSynchronizedRenderers.cxx, line 170

vtkSocketCommunicator (0xbe1f50): Tag mismatch: got 10, expecting 1.

Exiting?
#######################################

While the client spills out a ton of messages like the following and finally dies with ?xcb_io.c?? error:

#######################################

Any ideas what I?m doing wrong? This happens directly on attempting to connect. I?ve added the configure command I used below.

Thanks a lot in advance,

Michael


P.S:

Are the client and server created using the similar build flags? One
guess would be that you don't have MPI enabled on the server, but you
do have it enabled on the client build. Is that correct?

Rick,

Alas no, this isn't currently supported. But should be fairly
straightforward to add. I've reported a bug:

Attached is a XML that you can load as a plugin using the Tools |
Plugin Manager. This will add a new "Import CSV As Volume" source
under the "Sources" menu. On creating this new source, you'll be able
to select the CSV file and specify the relevant meta-data as
properties. I've setup the defaults to match the file you sent. The
Python code assumes that the CSV file has data in the same order as
VTK expects i.e. X varying first, then Y and then Z. Hence the image
dimensions are flipped.

Also, this is designed to work only for a single process mode, it'll
need some work if it's to work in parallel too.

Hi Utkarsh,

I think environment variables are kind of a band aid around a larger 
issue. In addition to leveraging the user's local environment, there's 
also no way to get information from the server side environment. for 
example list of account numbers a user can charge jobs to, or a list of 
active queues. One thing I have been thinking about is  rather than just 
reading pvsc from an xml file, paraview could call a script to get the 
pvsc xml. This script could query the user's local/remote environment 
and generate the xml. A long time ago we had talked about a python based 
solution. What do you think?

Hi Utkarsh,

It is the same installed version that I use both for the client and the server. As you correctly pointed out, MPI is enabled.

However, I somewhat narrowed down the scope of the problem. Apparently, if I use X forwarding via ssh, everything works correctly. Only if I run the ParaView client from within a VNC session the observed problems occur. Any idea where I might look for a possible solution? Using ParaView via X forwarding is unbearably slow in my current setup?

Burlen/Utkarsh ?? my preferred solution is also to not set an environment
variable if possible.  For my particular issue, I?d much rather be able to
do a `which ssh` (or equivalent) to get the answer than than asking the
user to set an environment variable.

Implementing a python-based default_servers definition opens things up for
much more programmatic flexibility.

# take a guess at which ssh command to use

try:
	default_shell=os.popen("which ssh").read()
	default_shell=default_shell.rstrip("\r\n")
except:
	default_shell="/usr/krb5/bin/

Hi Utkarsh,

I think environment variables are kind of a band aid around a larger
issue. In addition to leveraging the user's local environment, there's
also no way to get information from the server side environment. for
example list of account numbers a user can charge jobs to, or a list of
active queues. One thing I have been thinking about is  rather than just
reading pvsc from an xml file, paraview could call a script to get the
pvsc xml. This script could query the user's local/remote environment
and generate the xml. A long time ago we had talked about a python based
solution. What do you think?

Subject: [Paraview] MPI-aware reader plugin only has rank 0
Message-ID: <08115EE0-BE7C-4498-9B4A-CF8A8F436BBB@aia.rwth-aachen.de>

Hi there,

I?m having trouble getting my custom ParaView reader plugin to work correctly with MPI. ParaView was built with MPI enabled. After starting the server with

mpirun -n NN pvserver

I connect to it from a GUI client and try to load a datafile with the parallel reader plugin. To debug & test MPI first, I added the following lines to the RequestData method or the reader plugin:

int rank, size;
MPI_Comm_rank(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &rank);
MPI_Comm_size(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &size);
std::cout << ?rank/size: ? << rank << ?/? << size << std::endl;

The expected output on the pvserver shell would be something like this:

rank/size: 1/4
rank/size: 2/4
rank/size: 3/4
rank/size: 0/4

However, all I ever get is the last line, i.e. the output from rank 0. It thus seems like the communicator size is determined correctly, but only one process is really active. What am I doing wrong, or what do I have to do to get MPI to work as expected?

Thank you very much in advance

Michael

P.S.:

After starting the server and connecting to it, I get the following warning once per rank:

Warning: In /home/mic/.pool/.src/ParaView-v4.3.1-source/ParaViewCore/ClientServerCore/Rendering/vtkPVClientServerSynchronizedRenderers.cxx, line 170
vtkPVClientServerSynchronizedRenderers (0x1e000f0): Could not create the compressor by name .

Maybe this is related to the problem described above? I also get this warning on the client side, although only once or twice.

Burlen/Rick,

I am totally open to adding  new features/refactoring the pvsc code.
It hasn't changed much in a few years, and I am sure we know more than
we did when we started with this :). Since you guys are the ones
actually using this code in the field, it'd be great if you can
identify the feature list of things missing or difficult to do in the
current implementation and we can decide which would be best way
forward.

Should I create a google-doc or something which all can edit to built this list?

Which vnc server are you using? Seems to me your VNC server is missing
some X extensions (or something like that). We do use VNC servers here
for running tests, so it's known to work.

Thanks for the hint, this seems to resolve my issue: I use tightvnc-1.3.9-110.1.x86_64 on the machine where it does not work, but on a different machine (with tightvnc-1.3.10-14.2.1.x86_64 installed) it works.

Might not be just the vnc server version but maybe a related package, but it was definitely a fault with our site setup. Thanks for helping me to track this down!

Michael,

Let me know if you're still seeing this issue after the pvserver fix
and we can debug this further.

Hi Utkarsh,

Not 100% sure what you mean with the pvserver fix. If you refer to the previous issue (regarding vncserver & OpenGL), it does not affect this behavior. I can reproduce this using regular X forwarding via ssh.

Yes, I was referring to the VNC issue.

Well, try this: create a programmable source and try the following as
the "Script".

     from paraview.servermanager import vtkProcessModule
     print "rank=", vtkProcessModule.GetProcessModule().GetPartitionId()
     print "total=",
vtkProcessModule.GetProcessModule().GetNumberOfLocalPartitions()

What do you get?

Christian,

Sorry for the late reply, just saw this email.

You say things are slow when moving the scalar bar or resizing. Does
that mean things are okay when interacting with the 3D view?

Hi Utkarsh:

The script you sent yesterday solved the problem for me, now I can 3D
volume render the data!
Thanks for the help!

When I do not connect to a server, I get the expected output (rank=0, total=1).

If I do connect to the server, I get the following error (once per rank) from pvserver:

Something's not right with your server. Is it possible you have

Subject: [Paraview] memory inspector information through Python API
Message-ID: <CAMaOp+Hy1mv4Re7QrhNi0si2Bnyw0ErLpraq+f1ctV0N4U75Ng@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

It looks like vtkPVMemoryUseInformation is the main class that's used for
the Memory Inspector. Has anyone tried using this through ParaView's Python
API? It looks like it's getting wrapped but when I try to use it it causes
a crash.

Thanks,
Andy

Any problems with it via benchmark.py? It worked great perhaps six months
ago.

I do have multiple installations/builds. However, I don?t know how/if they could affect the execution of the paraview executable I?m using: both paraview and pvserver reside in the same (correct) directory on the PATH, and there?s nothing ParaView-related in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH. The only other variable I?ve found is PARAVIEWDIR, which was indeed pointing to an older installation; however, changing it to my installation did not change anything either.

The only other way I can think of how my installation could be affected is that the PARAVIEWDIR variable being set to a ParaView 3.x installation during build/install time and/or that I am using a Python installation in a non-standard location (specified during configure as follows; the Bash variables $PV_SRC, $PREFIX and $PYTHON27 are set to valid paths):

  CC=gcc CXX=g++ cmake $PV_SRC \
    -DBUILD_DOCUMENTATION:BOOL=ON \
    -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS:BOOL=ON \
    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Release \
    -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=$PREFIX \

Still working nicely. Also works the way I want with pvbatch in symmetric
mode!

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView and double precision Rendering
Message-ID: <16363023d4454e1b9eb3b0d582c91bbd@RZJMBX2.jr1.local>

Hello

I made a paraview reader plugin which loads Point data of type double from an ASCII file (can be choosen as checkbox in reader parameter gui). It is important that point data type is double since our values have a huge offset, e.g.

Coordinate in float:      3376382.75	-325198.59375	-121298.125
Coordinate in double: 3376382.849028525874	-325198.60899497801438	-121298.12806414699298
(same ASCII input file of type double, above printings come from spreadsheet view so loading is correct)
(all my points have such small changes, I definitely can see those small changes in 3d)

The problem is: I load the dataset once in float and once in double ( I checked result in spreadsheed view) I cannot see any differences in 3d renderer when I swap visibility of float and double input (but you can see in spreadsheet). Is the double precision rendering not correct/not supported?
Any ideas?

Message-ID: <2FE9F619592E8A4382310F62E7F06311022B82B40C30@MAIL1.ua-net.ua.edu>

Hello,

Is there an example of taking a simple two-index numpy array and creating a surface plot in ParaView through the python shell? An example of this for Mayavi is at



http://docs.enthought.com/mayavi/mayavi/auto/example_canyon.html#example-canyon



Really, if I just have some idea how to encapsulate the numpy  array into some VTK structure and then send the structure to the ParaView pipeline, I can probably figure the rest out.



I apologize if this is available someplace I haven't discovered yet (perhaps because of poor wording in my searches).



Many Thanks,

Eric Carlson

My bad -- can't believe I made such a rookie mistake. Here's the correct script:

from vtkPVClientServerCoreCorePython import vtkProcessModule
print "rank=", vtkProcessModule.GetProcessModule().GetPartitionId()
print "total=", vtkProcessModule.GetProcessModule().GetNumberOfLocalPartitions()

Utkarsh,

Previously, it was not okay when interacting with the 3D view.

Now, however, I have recompiled ParaView (both on the cluster and on
my workstation), and with settings at:

Remote Render Threshold : 0 (I don't think this was the culprit - it
was already low, but this makes it certain, I suppose)
Still Render Image Reduction Factor : 1 (I can't increase this, or I
seem unable to see the features of interest)
Image Reduction Factor : 8 (I'm uncertain if this is helpful, but
certainly the description would indicate it may be the option of
interest)

and
mpirun -np 12 path/pvserver --use-offscreen-rendering
each having a maximum of 16G RAM and an IB connection between nodes,
the problem is vastly reduced/gone.

I'm sorry I can't be more specific as to what changed to make this so
much smoother - there are still delays, but now these are just a few
seconds, and that seems reasonable, compared with the multiple minute
lockups previously experienced.

I suspect I might have had some combination of poorly chosen
compilation options, and poorly chosen rendering settings.

Best,

Christian

Thanks! This finally gives me hope that not everything is completely broken, as it yields the expected output (for 5 ranks):

rank 0
total 5
rank 2
total 5
rank 1
total 5
rank 4
total 5
rank 3
total 5

No change on the reader plugin though. Are there certain commands/libraries I have to include in the CMakeLists.txt file to make the plugin run in parallel? Or additional (VTK) methods I have to call to make sure that all ranks are participating?

When you said 

" rank/size: 0/4
However, all I ever get is the last line"

are you sure you don't mean that only printf/std:::cout from rank 0 is visible? but I actual fact the other pvservers are fine. Create a sphere and check if it has N pieces.

I also thought that it might be a visibility issue, thus I opened a file with std::ofstream on each rank with the rank id encoded in the filename. Only one file ever gets created, though, and it is the one with ?0? in the name.

> but I actual fact the other pvservers are fine. Create a sphere and check if it has N pieces.
I did that and visualized it by vtkProcessId. The number of ids indeed matches the number of ranks, so I guess nothing fundamental is wrong with the MPI use within ParaView. I just can?t fathom why the reader plugin does not run in parallel. Just to be sure, I added a call 

MPI_Barrier(MPI_COMM_WORLD);

in RequestData and indeed, ParaView gets stuck there, as apparently the collective call is never issued from any rank != 0.

Subject: [Paraview] Clipping volume dataset with explicit surface
Message-ID: <552CCD5C.10309@obs.ujf-grenoble.fr>

Hello,

I would like to know if there is a mean with paraview (or VTK, I could 
write a plugin) to easily clip a tetrahedron based geometry and data 
(built with a delaunay3D filter) with a polydata geometry (typically a 
triangle mesh) ?
The implicit sphere-based clipping could be an approximation but an 
explicit 3D function would be better for my application...

Thanks,

Yves

aha, then your problem is that the way readers handle parallel has been changed and you didn't set CAN_HANDLE_PIECEs or whatever the new name is

[pause]

outInfo->Set(CAN_HANDLE_PIECE_REQUEST(), 1);

is the new way. if you don't set this then your reader only gets created on rank 0

Hi

I am using Paraview 4.1.0 to render a 2k volume using two linux nodes and client on windows 7. In slice mode I can see the data but when I switch to volume mode it disappears. In the same configuration if I load a 512x512x512 volume, volume mode rendering is fine.

Can anyone please help?

Thanks
Sri
PS: each linux node have 2 x NVIDIA K40 card and 64GB RAM, on client I have switched on the Remote Render Threshold and set the value to 0Mbytes.

Hi John,

[pause]

outInfo->Set(CAN_HANDLE_PIECE_REQUEST(), 1);

is the new way. if you don't set this then your reader only gets created on rank 0

was that [pause] for effect? If yes, nicely done :) That was exactly the piece of information I needed. After googling I also stumbled upon this site, which helped explain a little further what I need to do: http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK/Parallel_Pipeline

Thanks again for all your collaborative help.

Message-ID: <552CE41D.4040703@tu-braunschweig.de>

Hi all,

I want to try out the python view for the first time, but I am not 
getting anywhere. I have created a python view and defined the functions 
setup_data and render. I tried the example script from the Kitware Blog 
(http://www.kitware.com/blog/home/post/588), and I do get the memory 
size in the output messages, but the python view stays all black (no 
plot, no axes, nothing). Am I just missing something?
I am using ParaView 4.3.1 64-bit Windows binaries.

Besides, I find it a little confusing, that I do not really know, when 
the script is executed. What about something like an 'Apply' button?

Kind regards
Ian

The same example can be trivially done in ParaView using a ProgrammableSource


programmableSource1 = ProgrammableSource()
programmableSource1.OutputDataSetType = 'vtkImageData'
programmableSource1.Script = 'import numpy as np\nimport zipfile\n\nexecutive = self.GetExecutive()\noutInfo = executive.GetOutputInformation(0)\nexts = [executive.UPDATE_EXTENT().Get(outInfo, i) for i in xrange(6)]\n\noutput.SetExtent(exts)\n\ndata = np.fromstring(zipfile.ZipFile(\'N36W113.hgt.zip\').read(\'N36W113.hgt\'), \'>i2\')\ndata = data.astype(np.float32)\ndata[data == -32768] = data[data > 0].min()\n\noutput.PointData.append(data, "scalar")'
programmableSource1.ScriptRequestInformation = 'executive = self.GetExecutive ()\noutInfo = executive.GetOutputInformation(0)\n\ndims = [1201, 1201, 1]\noutInfo.Set(executive.WHOLE_EXTENT(), 0, dims[0]-1 , 0, dims[1]-1 , 0, dims[2]-1)\noutInfo.Set(vtk.vtkDataObject.SPACING(), 1, 1, 1)\noutInfo.Set(vtk.vtkDataObject.ORIGIN(), 0,0,0)\n'

Dear all,

Whenever I connect the ParaView client to a pvserver instance, I get a warning like this:

Warning: In /home/mic/.pool/.src/ParaView-v4.3.1-source/ParaViewCore/ClientServerCore/Rendering/vtkPVClientServerSynchronizedRenderers.cxx, line 170
vtkPVClientServerSynchronizedRenderers (0x1deff60): Could not create the compressor by name .

Does anyone have an idea what I can do to disable this warning? It is issued twice by the paraview client and once per pvserver instance (when running in MPI mode).

Regards,

Michael

Did you copy and paste the script examples into the "Script" window, or did
you load the example state file on the blog? I suggest loading the state
file because the script examples in the blog post are missing some imports
that are needed. The state file has the complete script - I just confirmed
that it works on the 4.3.1 64-bit Windows binaries. You will have to point
ParaView to the bluntfin.vts file when you load the state file, which you
can download from

http://www.paraview.org/gitweb?p=ParaViewData.git;a=blob_plain;f=Data/bluntfin.vts;hb=1fa9dce1c623e2d467c44b5337ba3a8378a6a537

The Script is an auto-update property of the Python View. As such, it is
executed any time the view needs to re-render. This includes any time you
edit the script and then click elsewhere in the GUI, resize the ParaView
window, etc. It should work to click on the Python View after you have
edited the script - think of it as a big Apply button :-)

Thanks,
Cory

Many thanks! I can honestly say it may have taken years to figure that out on my own. It was helpful to add at the end:

programmableSource1.UpdatePipeline()

Also, the dimensions need to be perfect, so for anyone attempting this, the dimensions for this STRM elevation file are (3601,3601,1) and not (1201,1201,1)

Cheers, Eric

The same example can be trivially done in ParaView using a ProgrammableSource


programmableSource1 = ProgrammableSource()
programmableSource1.OutputDataSetType = 'vtkImageData'
programmableSource1.Script = 'import numpy as np\nimport zipfile\n\nexecutive = self.GetExecutive()\noutInfo = executive.GetOutputInformation(0)\nexts = [executive.UPDATE_EXTENT().Get(outInfo, i) for i in xrange(6)]\n\noutput.SetExtent(exts)\n\ndata = np.fromstring(zipfile.ZipFile(\'N36W113.hgt.zip\').read(\'N36W113.hgt\'), \'>i2\')\ndata = data.astype(np.float32)\ndata[data == -32768] = data[data > 0].min()\n\noutput.PointData.append(data, "scalar")'
programmableSource1.ScriptRequestInformation = 'executive = self.GetExecutive ()\noutInfo = executive.GetOutputInformation(0)\n\ndims = [1201, 1201, 1]\noutInfo.Set(executive.WHOLE_EXTENT(), 0, dims[0]-1 , 0, dims[1]-1 , 0, dims[2]-1)\noutInfo.Set(vtk.vtkDataObject.SPACING(), 1, 1, 1)\noutInfo.Set(vtk.vtkDataObject.ORIGIN(), 0,0,0)\n'

The dimensions set to (1201x1201x1) reflect the fact that the copy of the dataset I got had these dimensions, i.e. a lower resolution dataset then yours. I simply forgot to write it as a comment.

I also omitted the UpdatePipeline() since it was automatically triggered in the full pipeline (including a Show()) which I had used.

glad it helped.

Hi Yves,

Do you want to actually cut the tetrahedra that the polydata geometry
intersects? I don't know of anything that will do that exactly in VTK, but
you could approximate it by using the vtkImplicitPolyDataDistance class
with the vtkCutter to approximately cut the tetrahedra by the polydata.

If you DON'T want to cut the tetrahedra, you could write a plugin that
computes the distance field from each point in the tetrahedral mesh using
vtkImplicitPolyDataDistance, then thresholds the mesh to keep only
tetrahedra where at least some of the points have a negative signed
distance from the polydata.

I hope that helps,
Cory

Good to know it's working. If you haven't seen already, the ParaView
Guide's Chapter 15 covers details on various parallel rendering
parameters, which may come in handy. You can download the free PDF
from here [1], if needed.

What's the "Image Compression" setting set to? To access it, go the
Edit | Settings dialog in ParaView UI and then on the "Render View"
tab search for "compression". I suspect it's set to None. Change it to
Squirt for now. It's indeed a bug with the "None" compression setting
that I just noticed. I'll have a fix in soon.

Hi Cory - I wanted to try this -- I loaded the state file and the data file
(thanks for the link). But when the python view tries to render, I get,

Error: Cannot import matplotlib.backends.backend_agg.FigureCanvasAgg

and nothing appears. I'm running Paraview 4.3.1 64-bit on my Mac with
Yosemite.

Is this a Mac problem? Thanks! -- Adam

Can you try resizing the window or something like that? I wonder if
its an update issue.

OpenGL does not support double precision. VTK does not do anything special
in handling large coordinates and passes them to OpenGL directly. So
currently, you have to handle this yourself by rescaling your data.

Try applying "Extract Subset" filter to extract a slab of interest
first, and then slice it. You may not even need to "Slice" it. You can
extract a slice simply using Extract Subset filter as well. Just
specify the extent accordingly.

Hi Adam,

I am trying to reproduce this with ParaView 4.3.1 64-bit on a Mac with
Yosemite 10.10.2, but haven't been able to. This is the latest Mac binary
available for download on paraview.org. The matplotlib pot shows up as in
the blog post. Is your ParaView binary from paraview.org?

Thanks,
Cory

ok, i thought something like that....thanks for clearification


Our currently visualized point cloud is part of a very large one, and the global coordinate system has such a large offset.... Rescaling is an option but then the later processing chain results in wrong data (e.g. measurements have Values, needs also be scaled). So I would need to add a kind of field data "Data Offset" and "Data Scale" which every later added Filter needs to read (e.g. Ruler or some of our custom measurement filters). Is there anyting already mentioned for this in Paraview? I think I should not be the first one with that problem....



Best regards,

Gerald

Hello

I made a paraview reader plugin which loads Point data of type double from an ASCII file (can be choosen as checkbox in reader parameter gui). It is important that point data type is double since our values have a huge offset, e.g.

Coordinate in float:      3376382.75    -325198.59375   -121298.125
Coordinate in double: 3376382.849028525874      -325198.60899497801438  -121298.12806414699298
(same ASCII input file of type double, above printings come from spreadsheet view so loading is correct)
(all my points have such small changes, I definitely can see those small changes in 3d)

The problem is: I load the dataset once in float and once in double ( I checked result in spreadsheed view) I cannot see any differences in 3d renderer when I swap visibility of float and double input (but you can see in spreadsheet). Is the double precision rendering not correct/not supported?
Any ideas?

Hi Cory,

thanks a lot! I was missing the import statements. Now it works fine.
And I will remember the big Apply button :-).

Hi Cory and Utkarsh - So I never see a plot - just a black window. The
error message I sent earlier repeats every time I move my mouse over the
python view window.  I'm using Paraview 4.3.1 downloaded from paraview.org.
Paraview's "about" box is below.

Do you have a simple matplotlib plot I can try? Thanks! -- Adam

Thanks Burlen/Rick.

After discussing it with a few folks here, how about the following options:

a. What if we make it possible to run an "executable" to obtain a
value for any attribute in the XML. One could indeed use a Python
script to produce that value or any other executable.

b. We provide a mechanism to add a Python function in the PVSC. Before
(and/or after) the PVSC is processed by the UI for display, it will
pass the XML to that function which can update the XML as appropriate.
This would mean that the Python code has to be aware of the PVSC's XML
structure, but shouldn't be a problem since the Python code is
embedded in the PVSC XML itself.

Both will allow 1 and 2. 1 may still be a little hard work on the PVSC
writer side, but it's a one time thing.

Burlen, I think 3 is a little independent of this task. I do agree, we
should embed all necessary tools in the paraview bundle -- something
we've been talking about for a while. We should address that, I just
don't want to commit to it just yet :).

Thoughts? The more I think about it, I think I am leaning towards (b).
For (a) the next logical question becomes how does one specify the
path to the executable to run and we're back to the same problem we're
trying to address :). What are your thoughts?

Hi Adam,

I am running the exact same version of ParaView (my About box has the same
contents as yours), so this is a little bit puzzling.

Could you try two things:

1). Run ParaView, create a Python View, then enter this script:

import matplotlib

print matplotlib.__file__


import matplotlib.backends

print matplotlib.backends.__file__


import matplotlib.backends.backend_agg

print matplotlib.backends.backend_agg.__file__


Please report what the Output Messages window says.


2). Open the contents of your ParaView Mac bundle (right-click, "Show
Package Contents"), open up Contents -> Python -> matplotlib -> backends.
Please let me know if you see a backend_agg.py file in there.


Thanks,

Cory

Hi Cory - I tried your little script and got an interesting response...

/Applications/paraview4.3.1.app/Contents/Python/matplotlib/__init__.pyc
/Applications/paraview4.3.1.app/Contents/Python/matplotlib/backends/__init__.pyc
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 7, in <module>
  File
"/Applications/paraview4.3.1.app/Contents/Python/matplotlib/backends/backend_agg.py",
line 38, in <module>
    from _backend_agg import RendererAgg as _RendererAgg
ImportError:
dlopen(/Applications/paraview4.3.1.app/Contents/Python/matplotlib/backends/_backend_agg.so,
2): Library not loaded:
/Users/kitware/Dashboards/MyTests/NightlyMaster/ParaViewSuperbuild-Release-Python27/install/lib/libfreetype.6.dylib
  Referenced from:
/Applications/paraview4.3.1.app/Contents/Python/matplotlib/backends/_backend_agg.so
  Reason: image not found

These files exist,
/Applications/paraview4.3.1.app/Contents/Python/matplotlib/backends/_backend_agg.so
/Applications/paraview4.3.1.app/Contents/Python/matplotlib/backends/backend_agg.py
/Applications/paraview4.3.1.app/Contents/Python/matplotlib/backends/backend_agg.pyc


Interestingly, these files exist, but don't seem to be used...
/Applications/paraview4.3.1.app/Contents/Libraries/libfreetype.6.dylib
/Applications/paraview4.3.1.app/Contents/Libraries/libfreetype.dylib

If I run pvpython I see the same errors.

BUT --- If I do,
export
DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH=/Applications/paraview4.3.1.app/Contents/Libraries/

and then start Paraview from the command line,

/Applications/paraview4.3.1.app/Contents/MacOS/paraview

... and load the state file and the bluntfin.vts file ... Now I can see the
matplotlib plots!!!!!!

So it looks to me like you aren't setting a dynamic library path correctly
within Paraview's python.

Hope this helps. Thanks for the simple thing to try.

-- Adam

Hi Cory,

and thank you very much, your proposition works fine for illustration 
purposes. I need better accuracy, so I will do the computation 
completely differently. In fact I can achieve what I want with a simple 
contour applied on my surface wether using the volumic data.

Anyways, below the programmable filter script (input 0 is the tetrahedra 
volume, input 1 is the cutting polydata surface):
inpMain = self.GetInputDataObject( 0, 0 )
inpCut = self.GetInputDataObject( 0, 1 )
out = self.GetOutput()

cutter = vtk.vtkCutter()
cutter.SetInputDataObject( inpMain )
cutFunction = vtk.vtkImplicitPolyDataDistance()
cutFunction.SetInput( inpCut )
cutter.SetCutFunction( cutFunction )
cutter.Update()

outData = cutter.GetOutputDataObject( 0 )
out.DeepCopy( outData )

That helped, making me think about another way ;-)

I am using PV4.01 linux 64-bit binary version parallel version for the 
client downloaded from the paraview site.
On the server, PV4.01 was created for the source.

On my workstation I open the PV .pvtu file (I have 192 partition files 
and I am using 40 processors on the server for visualization.

I see the "Extract Subset" filter but it is not high lighted, should it be?

I looked at your youtube presentation "extract subset" with PV 3.3.0 
(development).
Forgot to mention that my mesh is unstructured.

Message-ID: <77EF680B37D6CA4F9457525A0E59B1FF8CC1BAE6@EXCHMBX01.fed.cclrc.ac.uk>

Hi

I am using Paraview 4.3.1 in client server mode. After loading RAW file, when I switch the mode to slice it throws up these errors and renders half of the slice.
ERROR: ParaView-v4.3.1-source/VTK/Common/ExecutionModel/vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline.cxx, line 857
vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline (0x4e96c70): The update extent specified in the information for output port 0 on algorithm vtkTrivialProducer(0x4e965e0) is 0 511 0 511 228 228, which is outside the whole extent 0 511 0 255 0 456.


ERROR: In ParaView-v4.3.1-source/VTK/Common/ExecutionModel/vtkTrivialProducer.cxx, line 279
vtkTrivialProducer (0x4e965e0): This data object does not contain the requested extent.

Any solutions?

Thanks
Sri

Hello

I am viewing streamlines, but I wish to save that as an image (png) with a
white background, axes colored black. How should I do that?

I tried the 'save screenshot' option, but it gives the blue background
color as well.

Thank you.

In that case, once you've applied the "Slice" filter, you can apply
the "Clip" filter and select the "Clip Type" to be "Box" instead of
"Plane" and then resize the clip-box.

fixed.

When you save a screenshot, the dialog box should give you an option labeled "Override Color Palette". If change that to "Print", it should write out the image with a white background.

Hello

I am viewing streamlines, but I wish to save that as an image (png) with a white background, axes colored black. How should I do that?

I tried the 'save screenshot' option, but it gives the blue background color as well.

Thank you.

Subject: [Paraview] Using MPI on a single machine
Message-ID: <54481d580a2e47f0b57e3502a898ed5b@XCGVAG24.northgrum.com>

Can anyone speculate on what sort of performance increase would be possible if I ran an MPI-enabled ParaView on a single standalone workstation?  The machine is a new iMac with 32GB RAM, 8 cores, and an AMD Radeon R9 M295X (4 GB VRAM).  I'm volume rendering a 4D NetCDF dataset (72 240 MB files).  I'm worried that contention for the GPU among the multiple MPI processes will result in similar (or worse) performance.  Using a single ParaView process, it takes about 15-20 seconds to volume render a single time step and I'm looking for ways to reduce the rendering time.  I'd just like to know if there is even a small chance that I'll get better performance before going through the process of building ParaView from source on OSX.  I've done it before on Linux, so this will be a new experience.

One more question ... Would it be more efficient to combine/concat these individual files into a single, larger NetCDF file?  Or does ParaView perform better with smaller files?

Thanks,
-Mike

about (a): running multiple commands for each field could be annoying if 
for ex one was trying to query a server side value and the user had to 
enter their password more than once.

about (b), sounds OK but I'm not sure how it would work with the 
connections to remote site.

in all this, I think we want to make the low-level (ie ssh tunnel) 
connection once and make use of it from then on, for everything. as 
opposed to making a connection for querying and then making another 
connection for submitting/connecting to pvserver etc (or in your (a) 
many connections).

In my suggestion of allowing a script(or as you "executable") to 
generate the pvsc xml, PV can use a pipe to communicate to first fetch 
the xml from the script then report the user selection back all while 
keeping the script alive, and same connection open.

	Paraview
Message-ID: <fa8fd34662ce43c89eae25d4aacc8137@xp11mbx2.nrel.gov>

Hello,

I am digging through the Paraview code to find out where I can control which of our 6-projector VR CAVE screens will draw the color legends. The default seems to put all legends on all screens, which is very distracting. Does anyone know where I can intercept these draw calls with an MPI_RANK check?

I'm on 4.2.0 with a 6-projector setup and a number of custom interactors. Not sure if the pvx and pvsm files are helpful, but I attached them anyway.

In vtkPVRenderView.cxx, remove the following line:

   window->AddRenderer(this->NonCompositedRender).

Now, none of the views will render any 2D annotations, including
scalar bars. Once that work, you can tweak it to only skip adding that
renderer on the views you don't care about using the MPI rank,
obtained from the vtkMultProcessController::GetGlobalController()
instance.

Message-ID: <C56848E2847DD943ADBF5C299DBDBBF2583D463E@S-BSC-MBX3.nrn.nrcan.gc.ca>

Hi I've upgraded to paraview 4 and now when building contours of my 3D unstructured grid, the contours are pixelated.  This was not the case in 3, and when you look at a slice of the contour overlayed with a slice of the volume data it is obvious that the contour in paraview 4 seems to be "hugging" the boundaries of my mesh instead of interpolating through it.  How can I get my nice smooth contours I had in version 3?

Thanks

It seems that in paraview 3 it would interpolate inside the cell between the mesh points when building the polymesh for the contour and now it is snapping the interpolation to nearest grid point of my unstructured mesh.

Utkarsh,

That was exactly what I was looking for! It works perfectly. For future reference, at around line 230 of

ParaViewCore/ClientServerCore/Rendering/vtkPVRenderView.cxx

I removed

  window->AddRenderer(this->NonCompositedRenderer);

And added

  vtkMultiProcessController* Controller = vtkMultiProcessController::GetGlobalController();
  if (Controller->GetLocalProcessId() == 3) window->AddRenderer(this->NonCompositedRenderer);

And it built and ran just fine.

Thank you!

Mark

In vtkPVRenderView.cxx, remove the following line:

   window->AddRenderer(this->NonCompositedRender).

Now, none of the views will render any 2D annotations, including
scalar bars. Once that work, you can tweak it to only skip adding that
renderer on the views you don't care about using the MPI rank,
obtained from the vtkMultProcessController::GetGlobalController()
instance.

going back to your original question. when exec'ing new processes there 
are various flavors of exec, including one that uses your environment. 
Which made me wonder which flavor is PV using? I wrote a little pvsc to 
test this out(attached). Apparently PV does use the exec that includes 
your environment. So if you want to use the ssh that's in your path, 
don't give the path in your pvsc, in the example you gave change it to

    <File default="ssh"/>

duh! (directed at myself)

I hope this discovery doesn't derail our discussion because the other 
features about being able to get information back from the server side 
we are discussing would be useful.

Michael,

I remember tracking down a similar bug like this. I recall it had to do
with the type of the points being specified as an integral type. The change
between 3 and 4 was that interpolation for the isocontours is now performed
with the precision available in the point type, so if your point type is an
integral value, you'll get this chunky result.

Try changing your point type in your data file to float or double.

Hope that helps,
Cory

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView as ThirdParty
Message-ID: <CAFvyM3SjKvx8BMqSHSAk4Srky-cgySEOi2mdor_SCPygiToHfA@mail.gmail.com>

so, I have been able to use ParaView as a thirdparty (in it's own
install/not build directory) for a little bit. However, there are a couple
of things:

(1) when selecting PARAVIEW_INSTALL_DEVELOPMENT_FILES, I must have
PARAVIEW_ENABLE_PYTHON:BOOL=ON; otherwise I get build errors for missing
libraries.

(2) then after a successful build, I try to build my project against these
ParaView/VTK libraries again; however, I get an error with
vtkPVInitializePythonModules()

Linking CXX executable mtview
CMakeFiles/mtview.dir/ParaViewMainWindow.cxx.o: In function
`ParaViewMainWindow':
/home/kdean/workspace-dsc/mtview/ParaViewMainWindow.cxx:108: undefined

collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
make[2]: *** [mtview] Error 1
make[1]: *** [CMakeFiles/mtview.dir/all] Error 2
make: *** [all] Error 2

Is there a reference point to try and Debug this issue? Thanks a lot.

Subject: [Paraview] Populate drop down list from filter data
Message-ID: <CAAx3GjvLu1wMza8yukRyHGympQ6JK-LStfMpRO+gW-OmE0B6pw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list,

our team is working on a filter bound to a GUI panel.
The filter, among other things, stores a vector of strings. The GUI panel
is a kind of customized properties panel (it derives from QDockWidget).
In that custom panel, we want to create a drop down list with the data from
the vector of strings held by the filter. The length of the vector of
strings is determined at run time by the filter.

We've been working on this for a couple of days, with the help of wiki
<http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Plugin_HowTo#Drop_down_list_with_values_from_input_file>
and by looking around for a similar feature in the paraview sources,
unfortunately without success.

Does anyone know how we could do that?

Cheers,
Antoine.

Yup, that was the issue, it was a simple matter of changing the coordinates of my grid to floating point instead of integer.

Michael,

I remember tracking down a similar bug like this. I recall it had to do with the type of the points being specified as an integral type. The change between 3 and 4 was that interpolation for the isocontours is now performed with the precision available in the point type, so if your point type is an integral value, you'll get this chunky result.

Try changing your point type in your data file to float or double.

Hope that helps,
Cory

It seems that in paraview 3 it would interpolate inside the cell between the mesh points when building the polymesh for the contour and now it is snapping the interpolation to nearest grid point of my unstructured mesh.

Subject: [Paraview] animation changing geometry representation
Message-ID: <552FE42C.5050109@lsce.ipsl.fr>

Hi,

How do change the representation of an object from the UI of paraview
when you make an animation ?

I know how to do change a property but not a type of representation of 
the geometry (Surface, Surface With Edges, Wireframe).
Ideally I would to pass from one representation to another with a 
progressive ramp.

Thanks for pointing me any tutorial on "making animation with paraview" 
if it exists.
Regards
Patrick

Dear?
        I use a ply file to do the test . I use two servers to render it and MPI to support the communication . when I use the command: mpirun -n 2 /bin/env DISPLAY=:0 /usr/local/paraview4.2/bin/pvserver ,and a client connect the server . Then I render the file , I found that " vtkParallelRenderManager::SatelliteStartRender()?vtkParallelRenderManager::StartRender()",the two function in vtkParallelRenderManager.cxx file isn't use in this test and these fuctions in vtkCommunicator.css:

int vtkCommunicator::Receive(vtkDataObject* data, int remoteHandle,int tag)?

vtkDataObject *vtkCommunicator::ReceiveDataObject(int remoteHandle, int tag)?

int vtkCommunicator::ReceiveDataObject(vtkDataObject* data, int remoteHandle,int tag, int dataType)?

int vtkCommunicator::ReceiveElementalDataObject(vtkDataObject* data, int remoteHandle, int tag)?

int vtkCommunicator::Receive(vtkDataArray* data, int remoteHandle, int tag)

also haven't been use on the satellite process. I can't underStand , It used which function to receive the data from the node process .  And where to distribute the data? Who can help me .Thank you !
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Sincerely!

Here's a potential approach:

<StringVectorProperty name="ChooseOne"
                      command="SetChosenOne">
  <StringListDomain name="list">
    <RequiredProperties>
      <Property function="StringList"
                name="AvailableOptionsInfo" />
    </RequiredProperties>
  </StringListDomain>
</StringVectorProperty>
<StringVectorProperty name="AvailableOptionsInfo"
                      information_only="1"
                      command="GetAvailableOptions"
                      si_class="vtkSIDataArrayProperty">
</StringVectorProperty>


With the following method prototypes:

  void SetChosenOne(const char*);
  vtkStringArray* GetAvailableOptions();

I have just a few days ago gotten to the same conclusion. Reading some large PLY files on our Cray nodes which only have 32Gb of memory, I would run out of memory and crash. Checking memory usage with the "Memory Inspector" will show that everything is loaded on rank 0.

Using the D3 filter works and is able to re-distribute the data among all tasks. I suggest you try D3.

Note also that ParaView is not able to animate through a time-dependent series of files, using the GUI. Never got any feedback on an earlier post (http://public.kitware.com/pipermail/paraview/2015-January/032999.html).<http://public.kitware.com/pipermail/paraview/2015-January/032999.html%29.> I resorted to some python programming to run the animation.

Subject: [Paraview] XDMF Set
Message-ID: <c9c55f69ef99edd411ba394e6257f6a7@cam.ac.uk>


I would like to be able to specify data, or subsets of data in the XDMF
format with Edge or Facet sets.

According to the header file of XdmfSet.h:

XdmfSet is a Class that handles sets of nodes,cells,faces, and edges
	on an XdmfGrid. They may be centered on the Node, Edge,
	Face, Cell. An XdmfSet can have from 1 to 3 DataItems. The last 
DataItem
         is always the "Ids" or the indexes into Nodes, Cells, etc. If 
SetType is
         "Face" or "Edge", the First DataItem defines the CellIds. If 
SetType is
         "Edge" second DataItem defines FaceIds

I have two questions:

1) What is the purpose of the FaceIds for a set of Edges?

 From what I can tell, using ParaView, the three dataitems provide:
global CellIDs, unused FaceIDs, cell-local EdgeIds

e.g. in this case, the first DataItem "0 0 1 1" lists the cells,
      the second DataItem "0 1 2 3" is ignored, and the third DataItem "0 
1 0 2"
      lists the cell-local Edges which have data attached?

  <Set SetType="Edge" Name="edgeSet">
           <DataItem NumberType="Int" Dimensions="4" Format="XML">
               0 0 1 1
           </DataItem>
           <DataItem NumberType="Int" Dimensions="4" Format="XML">
               0 1 2 3
           </DataItem>
           <DataItem NumberType="Int" Dimensions="4" Format="XML">
               0 1 0 2
           </DataItem>
           <Attribute Name="Set Values" Center="Edge">
               <DataItem Format="XML" Dimensions="4">
               100 200 400 600
               </DataItem>
           </Attribute>
       </Set>

Is that correct?

2) How can I specify an Edge set in 2D? Nothing seems to work in this 
case,
    as ParaView complains that the cells have invalid Faces.

Ian,

You should be able to access the point data in your "render" function with
the following

dataObject = view.GetVisibleDataObjectForRendering(i)

dataObject.GetPoints()

where i is the i-th visible object. This returns a vtkPoints object. I'm
not 100% sure if this works in client/server mode, though.

Hello,

Utkarsh, thanks for the advice. I had already installed from the ubuntu 
apt-get install system. Thus I didn't use the patch file you suggested.

I will try and do a re-build from the source file once more and let you 
know of the outcome.

Thanks.

Wonderful, thanks!

I don't work in client/server mode, so cannot say anything about it.

Subject: [Paraview] Pvbatch not performing significantly better in parallel
Message-ID: <39706665.IzY32bs0e0@debianxps>

Hi everybody,

I am trying to run pvbatch in parallel to render an animation, with a very 
easy script that looks like
     *  import sys
     *  from paraview.simple import *
     *  

     *  # read pvsm file from command line and load it
     *  stateFile = sys.argv[1]
     *  simulation = stateFile.split("/")[-1].split(".")[0]
     *  servermanager.LoadState(stateFile)
     *  

     *  # set active view and render animation
     *  SetActiveView(GetRenderView())
     *  WriteAnimation(simulation + ".jpg",magnification=2,quality=2)
I compiled paraview from sources, configuring with
cmake -DPARAVIEW_BUILD_QT=OFF -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -
DBUILD_TESTING=OFF  -DPARAVIEW_ENABLE_PYTHON=ON -
DPARAVIEW_USE_MPI=ON ..
and then building all.
I am doing a benchmark on 11GB of data distributed over many pvd/vtu 
files [written by an MPI application in parallel].
I copied the data to a tmpfs folder to ensure the execution is not slowed 
down by disk access.
Executing pvbatch on 1 or 16 processors doesn't really seem to change 
anything.In particular, I was expecting to see the frames appearing in 
blocks of 16 when running with mpi on 16 procs, but they always appear 
one at a time at a constant pace, which makes me suspect that the other 
processes aren't really contributing to the rendering.

What could I be doing wrong?Any suggestion is highly appreciated.
Best regards,
Massimiliano

Hi Massimiliano,

I don't think the XML unstructured grid reader partitions the data so all
of your cells are probably just ending up on process 0.

You may want to look at ParaView's spatio-temporal parallelism (
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Spatio-Temporal_Parallelism). Make sure to use
a time compartment size of 1 if you're just using the XML unstructured grid
reader.

Regards,
Andy

Hi Andy,

thanks for your reply. I think my cells are being correctly partitioned. I 
attach a screenshot of the grid when I color it by vtkProcessId.

The spatio-temporal parallelism could do the trick, but the nightly are 
unavailable in this moment and I can't find the plugin in my current 
installations. I'll try again later.

Anyway, I think I should get at least some benefit from pure spatial 
parallelism, which instead I am not experiencing.
Is there any setting I might be missing?

Best regards,
Massimiliano

Can you share your full pipeline? Using the state file it's tough to see
exactly what's going on.

You'll need to do your own build of ParaView and enable the spatio-temporal
plugin if you want to use that.

Sure, I have a pressure scalar field with a contour filter, a velocity vector 
field with a clip filter and an annotated time.

Do you want me to attach any file?

Thank you for your reply . But I want to know whether the paraview can do the parallel with the ply data . And where it redistribute the data and send them to other process, and how it do this. In my experiment , I found that :(189 is the root process)
189::use_distributed_rendring::true
189::use_ordered_compositing::false
189::this->GetRenderWindow()->Render();
190::use_distributed_rendring::true
190::use_ordered_compositing::false
190::this->GetRenderWindow()->Render();
we can see that it didn't use ordered_compositing, this to say ,it didn't need composite ,whether it say that it didn't need redistribute.
Or It distribute data after IO?
And 190 use its own window to render.It should use the 189's.I found 190::RenderEventPropagation::false . why this happen?

I have just a few days ago gotten to the same conclusion. Reading some large PLY files on our Cray nodes which only have 32Gb of memory, I would run out of memory and crash. Checking memory usage with the "Memory Inspector" will show that everything is loaded on rank 0.

Using the D3 filter works and is able to re-distribute the data among all tasks. I suggest you try D3.

Note also that ParaView is not able to animate through a time-dependent series of files, using the GUI. Never got any feedback on an earlier post (http://public.kitware.com/pipermail/paraview/2015-January/032999.html). I resorted to some python programming to run the animation.

Yes, please attach the state file and if it's small enough, one of the data
files.

It looks like you're actually using the parallel XML reader (.pvtu
extension) which should be decent for parallel performance. You probably
want one process per vtu file that's specified in the pvtu file.

The only representation properties currently supported from the UI are
Visibility and Opacity. You can, however, add a  "Python"  animation
track and then change arbitrary properties.

That sounds like a bug. Mind posting the error messages?

You should link with the library providing this function, as done in
ParaView/Applications/ParaView/CMakeLists.txt. Here's the relevant
code:

if (PARAVIEW_ENABLE_PYTHON)
  target_link_libraries(paraview
    LINK_PRIVATE vtkUtilitiesPythonInitializer)
endif()

Try doing  a "Debug" build i.e. set CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE cmake variable to
Debug and then attach a debugger. The call stack will provide some
clues. Feel free to share the callstack.

I think I tried that, but I will try again.
Anyway, what I was hoping to achieve was to have processor 1 render frame 1 
_while_ processor 2 renders frame 2 _while_ ...

This is what the time parallelism you told me about is meant for, right?

Subject: [Paraview] Segfault in PLY reader
Message-ID: <5537C1B7.1050907@ohio.edu>

Paraview segfaults when attempting to read Armadillo.ply from Stanford:

http://graphics.stanford.edu/pub/3Dscanrep/armadillo/Armadillo.ply.gz

The segfault happens both with the system PV on Fedora 20 :

$ rpm -q paraview
paraview-4.1.0-1.fc20.x86_64

and with the nightly dashboard version.

This system is bubbles on the dashboard.

I'm recompiling the nightly version with debug options now, but here is
a backtrace from the system PV and gdb :

Hi

Today i got an (maybe stupid) idea:

The solution of rescaling my double data to get correct viewing is not very elegant: All filter/sources settings will be in wrong relation (e.g. if I want to insert a sphere of radius 1, or if I want to measure my data using ruler, or if I want to watch my data in spreadsheet view)

Wouldn?t it better to write a ?view plugin? where all data firstly is rescaled/mean subtracted before sending to 3d polydata mapper? In that case all filter settings, ruler and so on will also work like expected. I never wrote a view plugin but is this in principle possible? Or should I use a ?representation plugin? for that.....

Any suggestions?

Best regards,
Gerald Lodron

OpenGL does not support double precision. VTK does not do anything special in handling large coordinates and passes them to OpenGL directly. So currently, you have to handle this yourself by rescaling your data.

Hello

I made a paraview reader plugin which loads Point data of type double from an ASCII file (can be choosen as checkbox in reader parameter gui). It is important that point data type is double since our values have a huge offset, e.g.

Coordinate in float:      3376382.75    -325198.59375   -121298.125
Coordinate in double: 3376382.849028525874      -325198.60899497801438  -121298.12806414699298
(same ASCII input file of type double, above printings come from spreadsheet view so loading is correct)
(all my points have such small changes, I definitely can see those small changes in 3d)

The problem is: I load the dataset once in float and once in double ( I checked result in spreadsheed view) I cannot see any differences in 3d renderer when I swap visibility of float and double input (but you can see in spreadsheet). Is the double precision rendering not correct/not supported?
Any ideas?

Sounds doable and very useful to me.

Conceptually it is simple, use the world space bounding box to rescale the
representations appropriately. You can mock it up at first in python with
the transform filter and/or display transformations.

Let us and especially the pv-developers list know if you run into problems.

Subject: [Paraview] Rendering in Paraview
Message-ID: <1429813289280.59896@kcl.ac.uk>

Hello Community,


I have a question concerning rendering in Paraview (Version 4.2.0). I have two .vtk files: i) an ellipsoidal volume geometry of hexahedral cells (cell type = 12) and ii) the internal surface of the ellipsoidal geometry represented using quadrilateral cells (cell type = 9). The first one is colored grey in the attached image, while the latter one is displayed in blue. Opening both of them at the same time leads to a quite confusing representation, which I don't really understand.


In the image attached the quadrilateral surface was opened first followed by the hexahedral volume. So I can understand why Paraview renders the left part in the color of the volume, but I do not get why it splits the rendering and is checkered on the right side? Is this an intended behavior or might I have made a mistake? I checked the coordinates of the points in both files and they are identical. Thanks!


Best, Thomas Fastl

Thomas,

This looks like a classic case of z-fighting:

One way to remedy this is to turn off the display of one of the surfaces.

If you want to use this approach, it is probably easier to use the transform filter and scale by 0.99 than use the calculator.

Thomas,

Assuming your x,y,z-origin is at the center of the ellipsoid, and you are using PV version4.3.1, you might be able to do the following:

If you want to display these two objects at the same time, use the "eyeball" in the Pipeline Browser to turn off the hex mesh, then use the Calculator filter just on the quad mesh to shrink its x,y,z-coordinates by, say, 0.99. This will "pull" the quad mesh just inside the hex mesh. You can then do whatever variable display you like on the objects.

If you are going to this display several times, the pipeline can be saved with Save State.

Hello,

thank you for the help so far, I really appreciate any input!

ad Cory's response: I totally agree, seems to be a classic thing in rendering and makes total sense to me. However, strange is that this happens only for the right half of the ellipsoid. Any ideas on that?

ad Sam's and Ken's response: I was thinking about doing that in Matlab during generation, but thanks for pointing out that I can do it pretty straight forward in Paraview directly, makes things easier.

Again, I think it is just a little bit strange that the rendering problem occurs only on one half of the ellipsoid, maybe someone has experienced something similar? Thanks!

Thomas

Ok, thanks

Good to know that it should theoretically work... The task is planned for a customer of us, the project is currently in acquisition phase so we do not definitely have the order yet...

Thanks for opinions....

Sounds doable and very useful to me.

Conceptually it is simple, use the world space bounding box to rescale the representations appropriately. You can mock it up at first in python with the transform filter and/or display transformations.

Let us and especially the pv-developers list know if you run into problems.

Hi

Today i got an (maybe stupid) idea:

The solution of rescaling my double data to get correct viewing is not very elegant: All filter/sources settings will be in wrong relation (e.g. if I want to insert a sphere of radius 1, or if I want to measure my data using ruler, or if I want to watch my data in spreadsheet view)

Wouldn?t it better to write a ?view plugin? where all data firstly is rescaled/mean subtracted before sending to 3d polydata mapper? In that case all filter settings, ruler and so on will also work like expected. I never wrote a view plugin but is this in principle possible? Or should I use a ?representation plugin? for that.....

Any suggestions?

OpenGL does not support double precision. VTK does not do anything special in handling large coordinates and passes them to OpenGL directly. So currently, you have to handle this yourself by rescaling your data.

Hello

I made a paraview reader plugin which loads Point data of type double from an ASCII file (can be choosen as checkbox in reader parameter gui). It is important that point data type is double since our values have a huge offset, e.g.

Coordinate in float:      3376382.75    -325198.59375   -121298.125
Coordinate in double: 3376382.849028525874      -325198.60899497801438  -121298.12806414699298
(same ASCII input file of type double, above printings come from spreadsheet view so loading is correct)
(all my points have such small changes, I definitely can see those small changes in 3d)

The problem is: I load the dataset once in float and once in double ( I checked result in spreadsheed view) I cannot see any differences in 3d renderer when I swap visibility of float and double input (but you can see in spreadsheet). Is the double precision rendering not correct/not supported?
Any ideas?

Subject: [Paraview] How to use calculate weighted sum of given timesteps in
	paraview?
Message-ID: <CAMkQf0umSiM_tJ2s=+YPU82Q6Levaa9nsjWvdk4RgnF2=UH8tA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I am doing proper orthogonal decomposition on a openfoam data set. The last
step is to calculate the weighted sum of given timesteps of the dataset.
But I found it is very difficult to do it in programmable filter because of
3 reasons:

1. In programmable filter it is difficult to pass weight vector to the
Script;
2. In script of programmable filter, the locals() returns: [self, inputs,
output, request], in which *self *is vtkPythonProgrammableFilter, *inputs *is
a list of CompositeDataSet, *output *is CompositeDataSet, and *request
*is vtkInformation.
I do not know how to use it; And according to the blog [
http://berkgeveci.github.io/2014/09/02/programmable-filter/], I cannot loop
over all timesteps in vtkPythonProgrammableFilter; The author of the blog
recommend using vtkPythonAlgorithm, but
3. I do not know how to use vtk filters such as vtkPythonAlgorithm in
paraview.

I have tried some methods. But none of them worked.
I tried to find how TemporalStatistics filter is implemented.
I referred the code in this pipermail [
http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2009-March/011443.html], it does
not request different timestep. But only used timestep values passed with
inputs;

I read this article on wiki[http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Time_in_ParaView].
But I am still confused. I tried >>>reader1.UpdatePipeline(t1)
>>>reader2.UpdatePipeline(t2)
The information tab in paraview shows different "Current  data time" in
reader1 and reader2. But if I use ProgrammableFilter to use reader1 and
reader2 as inputs, it seems that the result is controlled by VCR time on
the top of paraview GUI.

Some more frustrating problem is because of the complexity of
proxies/servermanager structure of paraview, I cannot access the vtk Object
behind of paraview proxies. Even if I can write a vtk class in python like
what Berk Geveci did in his blog [
http://berkgeveci.github.io/2014/11/09/streaming-time/], I cannot use it in
paraview directly.

My question is:
What can I do next to calculate weighted sum of given timesteps in paraview?

Thanks.

Message-ID: <553BF6AE.9070603@obs.ujf-grenoble.fr>

Hello,

I've just compiled paraview on its last git master branch and I get a 
strange segfault using pvpython with connection to a pvserver (no MPI, 
on localhost, linux). This occurs for instance, when creating a simple 
sphere with the following code:

from paraview.simple import *
servermanager.Connect( "localhost" )
s = Sphere()

The strange thing is that under the ParaView GUI python shell all works 
well.

I've made a little debugging and the error comes from 
ParaViewCore/ServerManager/Core/vtkSMParaViewPipelineController.cxx:609 
(vtkSMParaViewPipelineController::RegisterPipelineProxy())
the selmodel variable is NULL after 
proxy->GetSessionProxyManager()->GetSelectionModel("ActiveSources")

I recompiled on the

  * 4.3.1 release tag => same problem
  * 4.1.0 release tag => all works fine
  * 4.2.0 release tag => same problem

Any idea ?

Message-ID: <51646.88.235.39.115.1430052879.squirrel@webmail.be.itu.edu.tr>

Hi,

I am trying to connect Paraview server (pvserver) to test the Paraview
Catalyst example codes from GitHub account. So, i installed Paraview from
source (under Centos 7.0) without any problem and then test code. The
problem is that i am getting following error messages when i try to run
the example,

ERROR: In
/opt/progs/paraview-4.3.1/src/ParaViewCore/ClientServerCore/Core/vtkTCPNetworkAccessManager.cxx,
line 424
vtkTCPNetworkAccessManager (0x1063f00):
**********************************************************************
Connection failed during handshake. This can happen for the following
reasons:
 1. Connection dropped during the handshake.
 2. vtkSocketCommunicator::GetVersion() returns different values on the
    two connecting processes (Current value: 100).
 3. ParaView handshake strings are different on the two connecting
    processes (Current value: paraview.4.3).
**********************************************************************

In this case, both server and client are using same Paraview installation
and i disabled both firewall and selinux to eliminate the possible error
sources that might cause the problem. The server is also started using
following command,

[turuncu at epsilon-lnx CFullExample2]$ pvserver --server-port=22222
Waiting for client...
Connection URL: cs://epsilon-lnx:22222
Accepting connection(s): epsilon-lnx:22222

and the client code is running as follows,

[turuncu at epsilon-lnx CFullExample2]$ ./CFullExample2
SampleScripts/feslicescript.py

I enabled live visualization by setting it True and proper server address
and the port in the Python coprocessor code. I also tried to connect
server from another machine directly using Paraview and it is working. At
this point, i just need help to find the problem.
Best Regards,

Subject: [Paraview] CleantoGrid tolerance parameter for merging points
Message-ID: <1d25-553d1d80-9-1f8bfc20@207986181>

Hi,

I like to see some points of an untsructured grid be merged ?
Some points have coordinates equal to 1E-14, others 0.

When applying the CleantoGrid filter there is no entries 
to specify a tolerance parameter. 

Am I missing something or the only way to do this today is to 
apply a Calculator filter before with some new coordinates results as:
ceil(coordsX*1000)/1000*iHat + ceil(coordsY*1000)/1000*jHat + ceil(coordsZ*1000)/1000*kHat
It works but I would have prefered this kind of setting available from
the CleantoGrid filter.

I have digged a similar question in 2007 
http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2007-May/004914.html

Let me know if I should put a request on this missing feature 
on the paraview bug tracker or just live with it.

Regards
Patrick

Hi, Yves Rogez

I have encountered the same problem. And I think it is a problem about the
path.

Please compare the python version and environment setting in different
releases :

>>> import sys
>>> sys.version
>>> sys.path

And I think there are some differences responsible for the segfault .

Message-ID: <CA+U776B7qyxXn7rHmrmVR_kzzv1setfyZ3fy3VkUCy9Ts-EwCA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am trying to generate a 2d raster image from paraview in order to
generate a texture for another program.

Ideally I would like to extract an image with a number of pixels in the x
and y direction that is in the same ratio as the x and y bounds.

For example. Say I have a dataset with bounds [0, 19m] and [-10m, 23m] and
i generate a 2D contour. I would like a raster image with [19 * s, 33 * s]
pixel dimensions, where s is a scale factor. This image should also be
perfectly fitted with the vtk dataset so that

x_min => x_pixel = 0
x_max => x_pixel = x_max * s
y_min => y_pixel = y_max * s
y_max => y_pixel = 0

Is this possible at all? I assume that involves using python and this is
not a problem.

Thanks for any advice

Hi Magician,

Since Paraview 4.2, you have to use column_stack instead of hstack to
create a multi-component field. See this thread
http://public.kitware.com/pipermail/paraview/2015-April/033756.html

I have a user that wants to select the cell that includes a point, for instance at 1,1,1.  Any idea how to do this?  (I bet I'm just being dumb, this is so simple...)

Thanks,

There's no such thing as a dumb question :):

See this:
http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=14526

The current workaround is to use the filter "Extract Location" to
extract the cell at a specific location.

Message-ID: <1463853653.141289.1430270788783.JavaMail.yahoo@mail.yahoo.com>

Hi,
After going through the tutorial, I am puzzled how to achieve the following:
I have software that creates data, which I can visualize nicely with paraview.Different input parameters to the software create different data.
Each time I want to view another dataset, I open paraview, load the data, and then put all the filters again in place.
I find it a bit annoying that I need to organize the filters all over again, each time.
I suppose there is a way that allows me to load the data into an existing filter arrangement, so that I quickly can visit one dataset after another.
Can somebody give me some pointers how to do this in paraview?
Thank you!Rob.

Rob,

Did you try saving a ?state file?? What that is is basically it saves your current parameters/filters which you load after opening Paraview so that you don?t have to recreate them again.

  The way I do it is load my state file first, then my data. Works every time.

  Should be under File>Save State.


  Let us know if that?s what your looking for.

Rob,

There are two ways to do this:

1). Once your pipeline is set up, you can right-click on the input object
in the Pipeline Browers and choose Change Input... If you have loaded a new
data set, you can change the input to this new one.

2). As others have said, you can save a ParaView state file. When you
reload it, a dialog box asking you to confirm where the data files that
were loaded are located will appear, and you can change the locations of
those files to your new files there. Note that loading state files is
cumulative - you will need to reset the state manually if you want to clear
your old pipeline and data out. You can do this by clicking on the icon
with the two computers and red x.

Hope that helps,
Cory

Dennis,
The Python/ Programmable filter is a black box to me (i.e., I won't be much additional help).  However, the place i would start would be the new, super-duper ParaView Guide.  Kitware - and especially Utkarsh - have done a great job on it.

Rather than giving the link, here is how to find it.  It is sold in paper form on Amazon, and also is available as a .pdf for free (lacking 3 chapters, not related to the python filter).

paraview.org/ Resources/ ParaView Guide.  This includes the link to the .pdf.  You are interested in (at least) chapter 13.  It is listed under master section II, Reference Manual.

The numbers and labels (e.g. Y-Axis) are really blurry and not

Hey Dennis,

Which version of ParaView are you using? We have made some significant
improvements to the way we handle multi-block datasets (which Exodus
produces) in the latest version.

The interface in the Programmable Filter is somewhat different than what
you would have in a ParaView Python script. This is because you actually
have access to the full data and the objects in there are of different
types.

If you give me some examples of what you are trying to do in the
programmable filter, I can provide code that demonstrates the use of the
API in the programmable filter.

Best,
-berk

Berk,

Thanks for your reply.

I am using Paraview 4.3, so hopefully that has the improvements you mentioned.

I guess if I could figure out what objects are used for Blocks in side the Programmable filter I could do more on my own, but it?s clear they are different from in a python script, but still not clear what they are.

So a typical application would be a special version of point data to cell data.

I have some node variables.     I want to find all the nodes attached to each element, do some calculations on those node variables to generate a new element variable.   So basically like

Loop over blocks
     Loop over elements in block
                Find all nodes connected to element
                Perform calculations based on node variables
                Assign new element variable(s) based on calculations

Thanks for any insight ? Alan at Sandia has suggested I check the latest user guide, and I will, but I haven?t seen a good element example for the Programmable filter yet ? I don?t have any problem doing nodal manipulations, but I have a good example of that.

All,

I?m a little confused by what objects are inside a programmable filter.    I have a multi-block EXODUS dataset.    When I read this in it is a Exodus2Reader object (sp?) and I can access the blocks, pointdata, celldata, etc in a python script.

Once I get inside the Programmable filter, the  blocks of the input[] seem to have different member functions than they did in a Python script.   So I can?t figure out  how to get connectivity,   number of cells in a block, generate new cell variables, etc.

So, if I?m in a Programmable Filter, what object do I look at in either the Paraview or VTK class libraries to understand what the properties of the block are?

Thanks very much for any insight you can give.

Dennis

Related to this. What if I have a transient simulation and I change some
parameters. The two simulations have a different number of time steps. How
do I deal with this situation? Loading the state does not seem to work as
expected (not all the timesteps are visible if the second simulation has
more). Any ideas in this case? Also Jesse, what do you mean that you load
your state file first? If I do that it ask me what data set I wish to load.
Is that what you are referring to?

Dr. Cohen,

   What I mean by this is, when I first start Paraview, I hit File>Load State. Basically, there?s instances with the data that I used that I want saved and loaded when I revisit Paraview., whether it be a certain aspect of an image, a different field piece (I?m working with electromagnetics), etc.

I have a standard client-server connection set up to a remote system.   I'm

I've been looking at settings and command line flags, but I don't see
anything in the GUI or the client.   There does seem to be a flag on the
pvserver, but the user doesn't have access to that flag directly using the
preconfigure job launching configuration scripts.

Sorry, my bad.

This is an "advanced" setting.  The Settings panels now have standard (default) and advanced layouts (sticky, which is what I currently have).  You change it by clicking the little gear icon in the upper right corner of the Settings dialog.  This setting is found in the advanced settings.

That would do it if I could find such a thing!  That exists in 4.3.1?

Would I have had to do something at build time to enable such a feature????

I have a standard client-server connection set up to a remote system.   I'm
dumping out a long animation, saving JPG files.     If I iconify my ParaView
session or allow the Linux screenlock to kick in, my resulting saved images
are corrupted (blank, black, garbled).        In this scenario, is there
some way to force ParaView to do offscreen rendering in this interactive session?


I've been looking at settings and command line flags, but I don't see
anything in the GUI or the client.   There does seem to be a flag on the
pvserver, but the user doesn't have access to that flag directly using the preconfigure job launching configuration scripts.

Sorry, my bad.

This is an "advanced" setting.  The Settings panels now have standard
(default) and advanced layouts (sticky, which is what I currently have).
You change it by clicking the little gear icon in the upper right corner of
the Settings dialog.  This setting is found in the advanced settings.

Subject: [Paraview] Any suggestion for work environment to run Catalyst
	examples ???
Message-ID: <55422C4C.3050601@be.itu.edu.tr>

Hi,

I would like to run Catalyst examples but i failed in following attempts:

*1 - MacOS 10.10.2 + **Enthought **Canopy_64bit 1.4.1.1995 + 
OpenMPI**1.8.4 + Paraview 4.3.1 source*

When i trying to install Paraview 4.3.1, i am getting error related with 
qsqlite library after compiling %99 of the source. There are some 
discussion in the net but it does not solve the problem.
*
**2 - Centos 7.0 + output of package Python 2.7.5 + OpenMPI ***1.8.4 *+ 
**Paraview 4.3.1 (installed under VirtualBox)*

It gives following error when i try to run the Catalyst examples. In 
this case, both Paraview and Catalyst examples are compiled without any 
problem

ERROR: In 
/opt/progs/paraview-4.3.1/src/VTK/Parallel/Core/vtkSocketCommunicator.cxx, 
line 812
vtkSocketCommunicator (0x13a6090): Could not receive tag. 1

when i try to use pre-compiled Paraview, then i am getting following error.

ERROR: In 
/home/kitware/Dashboards/MyTests/NightlyMaster/ParaViewSuperbuild-Release/paraview/src/paraview/VTK/Common/System/vtkSocket.cxx, 
line 572
vtkClientSocket (0x1deeb20): Socket error in call to send. Broken pipe.

At this point, i just wonder about the details of work environment that 
runs Catalyst examples (found in Git repository) without any problem. 
Which operating system (Fedora, Ubuntu etc.) and version can be used? 
Which Python and Paraview version? Any particular library that will be 
used in the installation? Any success about running Catalyst examples? I 
just want to reproduce the results of the examples and first, i need to 
setup environment for it. Please let me know your experience about it. 
At this stage (with current documentation and information), it is 
impossible to not run the examples.

Best Regard,

--ufuk

Hi,

It's tough to diagnose what's going on with the Catalyst examples. Can you
try running pvbatch or pvserver in parallel? My guess is that could be the
issue. Another possibility is confusion between header files. I don't
regularly build on Macs so I don't have much experience there. I do know
that the Catalyst examples are built on several architectures for testing.
I hope to get a dashboard up in the near future to test this out better.

Regards,
Andy

That is indeed a bug that has been fixed in the development version of
ParaView. See http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=15407.
As a work around, you can manually delete the EndTime properties in
the XML state file.

Hi Dennis,

Here is an example that works in 4.3:

from vtk.numpy_interface import dataset_adapter as dsa
iterator = dsa.MultiCompositeDataIterator([inputs[0], output])
for iblock, oblock in iterator:
    oblock.PointData.append(iblock.PointData['DISPL'], "DISPL")

A few points:
* MultiCompositeDataIterator() allows you to traverse the input and output
datasets together so you get matching datasets
* iblock and oblock correspond to input and output blocks
* For the API for the iblock and oblock objects, see the User's Guide or
numerous blogs that I wrote on the topic under www.kitware.com/blog
* vtkDataSet API is also available through those objects so you can call
things like GetNumberOfCells(), GetNumberOfPoints() etc.

Best,
-berk

Besides unstructured grid format, do any others allow the Volume 
(Render) option to be available in the representation pulldown in 
ParaView? I tried .vtr format and that didn't work. Thanks.

rectilinear grid (vtr), structured grid (vts), and polydata (vtp) can not
unstructured grid (vtu) and image data (vti) can

hope that helps

Subject: [Paraview] Any suggestion for work environment to run Catalyst
 examples ???

Hi Andy,

Thanks for your kindly help. I am little bit desperate about testing
Catalyst and i could not find detailed documentation about it. If i run it
without any error, i will share my experience along with step by step
guide as a reference for everyone.

Anyway, as i told before, i testes two different system (MacOS and Centos)
to make it run but i failed. As you suggest, i run the pvserver in
parallel mode (under Centos) using following command,

mpirun -np 2 pvserver --server-port=22222

and i opened Paraview (installed from source) and tried to connect to the
server. In this case, i am getting following error in server

ERROR: In /opt/progs/paraview-4.3.1/src/VTK/Common/System/vtkSocket.cxx,
line 572
vtkClientSocket (0x2ee2d90): Socket error in call to send. Broken pipe.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
mpirun noticed that process rank 0 with PID 4557 on node epsilon-lnx
exited on signal 11 (Segmentation fault).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

If i use prebuild version of Paraview, i could connect to server without
any error. Then, i also use Catalyst menu to connect to the server too.
After that i run the example code as follows,

mpirun -np 2 ./CFullExample2 SampleScripts/feslicescript.py

in this case, i modified the SampleScripts/feslicescript.py Python script

coprocessor.EnableLiveVisualization(True, 1)

to enable live visualization and i also change the port from 11111 to
22222. The server gives following error as before and exit

ERROR: In /opt/progs/paraview-4.3.1/src/VTK/Common/System/vtkSocket.cxx,
line 572
vtkClientSocket (0x26acd90): Socket error in call to send. Broken pipe.

but code is working and produce the output. Do you have any idea what is
going on there? I am open to any suggestion.

Regards,

--ufuk
