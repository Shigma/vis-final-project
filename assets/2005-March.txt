ParaView used to support an external VTK but it requires VTK to be built 
with a specific set of options.  It also requires a matching version of 
VTK (down to the second in CVS time).  We had too many problems with 
users not having matching versios of VTK or building it with conflicting 
options or compilers.  The solution is to include VTK with ParaView to 
make it all do the right thing automatically.  It turns out that only a 
minimal part of VTK needs to be built and that ParaView's VTK wouldn't 
be that useful as a stand-alone VTK anyway.

There were no changes in the Utilities/TclTk directory between 1.8.3 and 
1.8.5.  If you are still able to duplicate the problem please send me 
the broken version of build_tcltk.sh and the working one.

Brad,

When a separate VTK is built and installed, do you know whether there 
is an overlap of files in the lib and include directories? It appeared 
that there might be (even though there was a VTK subdir in lib) but I 
did not have time to verify all of the load times.

Yes, there is a fairly large overlap. When you "make install" paraview its
own vtk will overwrite the separately built/installed vtk (if there is
one). And this might cause some vtk-based applications broken as these two
VTKs are "slightly" different versions and built with different cmake
options as Brad pointed out.

I'm actually working on fixing this right now so that ParaView installs 
its VTK in a separate place.  Hopefully I can get it fixed before the 
next release.  Otherwise you'll have to use a different 
CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX for paraview.

I think I found out what was the problem...

I was trying to compile the source files provided in zip format in a Linux
system. In reality, Linux systems are able to unzip files compressed in zip
format without any problem, but I think these source files was generated in
a DOS system, thus they aren't suitable for like-Unix systems.

The development distribution builds a separate executable, pvclient.

Since the entire paraview build takes a long time on my laptop, and I just want to use the client there, is it possible to build only the client, and, if so, would that likely to save me much time?

Thanks.

No, pvclient requires almost all of ParaView to build anwyay.

Only the "ParaView Guide" book and the open-source code in GUI/Client is 
available.  While it is possible to write your own client, it is a 
non-trivial task.

Hello all,

I was wondering if anybody could give me a hand about the following
question:

I'd like to cut a 3D CFD model (unstructured mesh) by a plane and compute
the scalar stream function using this 2D plane. Furthermore, this stream
function as a scalar parameter could be used to produce countour lines in
the 2D plane. Note that this countour line would be equal the stream lines
over the 2D plane.  

When working with Ensight there is a function provided by the CFD calculator
only to compute stream functions, vorticity, swirl, etc... But I'd rather
use only Paraview in my visualizations. Ensight is too boring to use... 

I've already tried something with the Paraview's calculator but I don't know
how I could compute derivative greatness with this calculator. 

Thanks in advance for any help

Unfortunately, the array calculator is not capable of doing this.
Neither is any filter that is in VTK. One would have to write a new
filter. I do not have time but I would be happy to help any
volunteers.

Is there any plan to incorporate the Delaunay3D filter into the paraview ?

I have a structure with only the boundary mesh data available.
I have results for many interior points but with no mesh.
In order to use the viz tools (isosurface, plane contours, cutter)  I need 
to have a mesh, right?
What would be the best way to do this. I was considering using
Delaunay3D..is there any other filters available.

Thanks

It is possible to "enable" any filter available in VTK by simply
writing an xml module and loading it at run time. This is described in
detail in the ParaView Guide as well as the mailing list archives.

OSX 10.3.8
CMake 2.0.5
Paraview 1.8.5

I cannot get passed "Paraview requires an out of source Build". I have created a separate directory and run cmake from there but get the same message. CXX and CC are set. make is an old gmake (3.79) and not a bsd make. Typical output shown below:

bolt:~/pub/paraview-1.8.5-bin $ cmake ../paraview-1.8.5
-- Check for working C compiler: gcc -- works
-- Check for working CXX compiler: c++ -- works
ParaView requires an out of source Build. Please create a separate binary directory and run CMake there.
-- Configuring done
bolt:~/pub/paraview-1.8.5-bin $

I get the same results running interactively.

Any suggestions how to get passed this?

This means you already ran an in-source build.  You have to create a 
fresh source tree with no extra files in it.  In particular, no 
CMakeCache.txt file can be present there.

 OSX 10.3.8

Clearing out and starting again enabled a compilation to start. I am now getting:

This looks like an incorrect set of -D flags for tcl/tk?

About a year ago with the previous version of paraview I lost a day trying to fix the paraview version of tcl/tk directly by editting the makefiles, headers, source and failed. If we assume it is primarily a configuration problem (tcl/tk runs on OSX) where should I look to change the configuration parameters?  Has paraview been successfully built on OSX?

Andy,

	Are you building ParaView X11 version ? If not then turn the flag 
VTK_USE_X to ON  in your CmakeCache. There has also been report of 
successful build of Carbon version using Apple official tcl/tk. For more 
info:

OSX 10.3.8
CMake 2.0.5
Paraview 1.8.5

Thanks for the encouragement. Turning X on and carbon off in cmake allowed the build to continue. We have no particular preference for GUIs and are happy with X.

The build then failed when linking paraview, pvbatch and pvserver. Adding the -noprebind flag allowed the build to complete.

The tests all passed once I realized screen blanking was causing failure (I left for a cup of tea). MPI was not included in the build.

Now to get some of our data in and see how well it works...

I don't think the -noprebind flag should be needed.  According to the 
Darwin linker documentation, this option is only needed to ignore the 
LD_PREBIND environment variable.  Does your environment have the 
LD_PREBIND environment variable set?

Subject: [Paraview] force execution of network
Message-ID: <422E2DCB.7010601@as.arizona.edu>

Is there a method to force paraview to ignore the time stamps and 
update the entire network? If I place new data in a file, I cannot 
find a way to get paraview to recognize that the file time stamp has 
changed, or that it is updated.

Also, with using glyphs, situations arise where the code appears to 
feel everything is updated when it is not.

Thanks
don

Hi All

I guess some of you may have already included the vtkVRMLexporter with the 
paraview. In that case I would like to look at the code. Somehow I can 
generate the vrml file but Cortona Viewer
shows nothing.

Thanks in advance.

Hi All

I have a body with holes and the mesh is only on the external surfaces. Can 
I mesh it in paraview. If I use Delaunay3D it totally ignores the hole ...
Does anyone have any experience regarding this ?

Hi,

what exactly do you mean by 'ignoring the hole?' 
How does the size of the hole compare to the mesh?
Did you play around with the parameters or tried 
selected regions? There are also some other filters
which can be used for surface reconstruction which 
might be more robust.
Also, I've only used the Delaunay2D/3D filter using 
paraview before the pvsm files came into force. Could you
post the xml/pvsm files that you are using?

Axel

Hi All

If you have a 4x3x2 box with a cylindrical hole inside, vtkDelaunay3D fills 
the hole with cells.
Is there any way to let vtk or paraview know about the boundaries.
Is voxelize an option.

I am would like to know how to include VRML exporter in paraview.  In the 
"paraview Guide" there
are some instructions to Save window images as .png format. I was wondering 
if we have to take
this direction. Or we can include it using some kind of XML script.

Please give some suggestions.

Hello all,

Does anybody know how I query extreme values (maximum and minimum) in
Paraview? I was trying to use the probe filter but unfortunately it doesn't
have this option yet :-(

Thanks in advance for any help

If you create a contour of the field you're interested in the contour range
will set itself to the min and max.  I'm not sure how precise it is...

It is exact (to within the precision of the print statement) for linear
cells -- extrema always occur at vertices and all vertices are examined.
It is not exact if you have an unstructured grid with quadratic data,
since only points are examined and the quadratic cells use a Lagrangian
interpolant that is not bounded by the values taken on at vertices.

Subject: [Paraview] loading 
Message-ID: <200503112353.j2BNrN2p007881@pilsener.srv.ualberta.ca>


Hi,

I have a set of polydata that I would like to load into ParaView.
My problem is that it's taking way to long to load and it seems 
to be spending most of its time in the Quadric Clustering filter.
The data set looks like this:

   # vtk DataFile Version 2.0
   IBD stuff
   ASCII
   DATASET POLYDATA
   POINTS 1180014 float
   5.999289e+002  1.174816e+003  1.198756e+003  
   5.999289e+002  1.174989e+003  1.196801e+003  
   5.999289e+002  1.174927e+003  1.202675e+003  
   ...

There are over a million points each with a single scalar value
associated. 

When I cut the data set down to 10,000 points it takes 30 sec
to load and if I use 100,000 points it loads in 1900 secs. Most 
of the time the progress bar is indicating that the Quadric
Clustering filter is working hard. I've never used it and I'd
_really_ like to turn that filter off but I can't find a way to do
that in the interface - it seems to be default behaviour on loading
this data set.

I'm not experienced with ParaView at all (just downloaded it
yesterday), but this data set loads in both VTK and MayaVi in a
small number of seconds.

I'm using the latest binary of ParaView 1.8 on WinXP.

Is there a way that I can change the behaviour of the loader
so that the Quadric Clustering filter isn't called?

Thank you,
Jon.

Subject: [Paraview] movie from CVS image
Message-ID: <4235D041.2070808@as.arizona.edu>

Hello,

The no CVS version will not generate movies the way I desire. There 
has been a lot of effort visible in the recent CVS downloads I have made.

Last week, when I entered the first in a sequence of frames, Paraview 
jumped into move mode and all of the command buttons, including 
File-Quit where grayed out.

This week the behavior with loading the first image is improved. But I 
cannot locate the old animate bu filename sequence. The only thing 
available is animate buy keyframe, and selecting the filename as the 
animated property does not expose the rest of the sequence.

If I View source, and depress timesteps, only the current image is 
displayed in the right window. The left window contains 3 dots, but no 
images to add. Browse also only returns a single image from the sequence.

How does one generate a movie from a sequence of images. Is this 
currently disabled in the CVS builds?

Thanks for your help
don

Subject: [Paraview] Getting CMake to Use Initial Cache File
Message-ID: <894632893A47D2B674EA87A0@harpo.psc.edu>

I've had good success getting CMake to use a cache initialization file with 
a command like

   cmake -DVTK_USE_MPI:BOOL=1
      -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS:STRING
      ="-D__USE_STD_IOSTREAM -pthread"
      -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS:STRING="-pthread"
      -c FixupLemieuxMPI.txt ../src

The "-D" options were added because CMake seems to ignore these values when 
they are in the initialization file (a bug report has been filed).

Continuing: I'm now working on compiling with MPI and so added almost a 
dozen more settings to the cache initialization file. And CMake ignores 
every single one of them!

I've attached this initialization file. Does anyone see what I've done 
wrong?

Thanks!

Look in Servers/ServerManager/Resources/writers.xml and 
GUI/Client/Resources/Writers.xml to see how the currently available

The option to use an initial cache file is a captial "-C" not a little "-c".

Assuming that you are using Raw (binary reader) (vtkImageReader) for
reading the images, this is what you need to do to animate a sequence of
images. 
For sake of simplicity let's assume that we are trying to animate the 
images in "ParaView/Data/Data/headsq". Here are the steps I follow:

Load Data quarter.1 (ParaView will require you to select the type of
reader, I choose Raw (binary) Files Reader.

Next, click on Timesteps. It lists all the files in the directory
"ParaView/Data/Data/headsq". Add a couple of files.
Change File Dimensionality for the reader to 2.
Change Extent for the reader to 0 63 0 63 1 64.
Accept.

Then, go to the animation interface via   "View" | "Keyframe Animation".
In "Animation Settings", enable "Show all animatable properties".
The reader should now be visible in the "Animation Tracks" pane.
Expand the reader tree, and click on the track for "FilePrefix".

This will add two key frames, first on initialized to the start of the
timesteps we selected earlier and the last one to the end of them.

One can now animate over the files.

One reason, why the left window has not images to add is because the
images are in different directory (?).

Message-ID: <6.2.1.2.2.20050315124002.02841430@pop.mcs.anl.gov>


I'd like to mirror, on my own control panel (which might be a new notebook, or an extra page of an existing one) the contents of certain frames from the "Display" and "Parameters" pages of the "Source" notebook.

I.e., I want to be able to create my own widgets, in my own panel, that are of the same type and the same values as those in the above-mentioned frames.

How do I access that data?  (I've dug, for some time, in vtkPVSourceNotebook, vtkPVSource, vtkPVWidget, vtkKWWidget, etc., and how to get at that data is, so far, still hidden.)

Thanks.

I wasn't specific enough about the "Parameters" page.

I want to reproduce the widgets (and their values) that are created, from the XML specs of various sources, inside the MainParameterFrame of vtkPVSourceNotebook (in addition to the widgets in certain frames from the "Display" page).

for simple vtkSource-objects may be that copy of code will help:

   vtkPVSource* pvs = this->Window->CreatePVSource("SphereSource");
   pvs->CreateProperties();
   if (pvs)
   {
      pvs->IsPermanentOn();
      pvs->Accept(1, 1);
      pvs->SetTraceReferenceObject(this->GetWindow());
   }
   vtkSMSourceProxy* proxy = pvs->GetProxy();
   vtkSMProperty *prop = proxy->GetProperty("Center");
   double x1=1.0;
   double x2=1.0;
   double x3=1.0;
   double radius = 1.0;
   vtkSMDoubleVectorProperty *doubleprop = 
vtkSMDoubleVectorProperty::SafeDownCast(proxy->GetProperty("Center"));
   doubleprop->SetElement(0, x1);
   doubleprop->SetElement(1, x2);
   doubleprop->SetElement(2, x3);
   pvs->SetLabel("Ball");
   doubleprop = 
vtkSMDoubleVectorProperty::SafeDownCast(proxy->GetProperty("Radius"));
   doubleprop->SetElement(0, radius);

   pvs->GetPVWidget("Center")->ResetInternal();
   pvs->GetPVWidget("Radius")->ResetInternal();

   pvs->SetVisibility(TRUE);
   pvs->AcceptCallback();
   pvs->Update();


If you/anybody find a way for complex objects
like for the vtkUnstructuredGrid see code below - it would help me to !
  
   vtkPoints *points = vtkPoints::New();
   vtkUnstructuredGrid *ugrid = vtkUnstructuredGrid::New();
   vtkVoxel  *voxel  = vtkVoxel::New();
   for(int u=0;u<numberOfVoxels;u++)  
  {
     vtkVoxel  *voxel  = vtkVoxel::New();
     voxel->.....set data
     ugrid->InsertNextCell(voxel->GetCellType(), voxel->GetPointIds());
   }
   ugrid->SetPoints(points);
   vtkDataSetMapper *gridMapper = vtkDataSetMapper::New();
   gridMapper->SetInput(ugrid);
   vtkActor *gridActor = vtkActor::New();

Subject: [Paraview] help on render-server-mode
Message-ID: <LKEFLNLCIIIPIEMBGKBICEGNCAAA.jlakshmi@iupui.edu>

Hi,

I am trying to run paraview in render-server-mode. This what I would like to
do. I using 3 compute nodes Render1, Render2 and Render3.

I would like to run a data server and render server on render2 and another
data server and render server on render3. Also I would like my
render-server-client on render3. So, I did the following:

On Render2:

(*) Paraview -v
(*) Paraview -rs -m=machine_file


On Render3:
(*) Paraview -v
(*) Paraview -rs -m=machine_file


On Render1:
(*) praview -crs -h=render2 -rsh=render2

My machine_file reads out like this:
render2
render3

I expect a functional render-server connection between 2 of my
render-servers and 2 of data servers with my client on render1. But on the
contrary, render-server client connects to data-server and render-server on
Render2. But my servers on the Render3 still waiting for connection. I can't
figure out whats going on here. Any help will be appreciated.

Thanks much
-Jagan

Subject: [Paraview] Grid connectivity,  Delaunay3D?
Message-ID: <4239B979.7040704@colorado.edu>

Hi

   I have been working with ParaView recently to visualize velocity and 
vorticity fields generated form an adaptive wavelet collocation solver,
 which our group has been developing.  The data fields I have are an 
adaptive subset of a regular grid. For each point in the field I have
scalar or vector values and a field location.  I have been saving data 
into an unstructured grid VTK file format, but I do not have any cell 
information,
just points in space.  This allows me to use glyphs but as far as I can 
figure out I cannot do isosurfaces, volume visualizations, streamlines 
and so on.
If I understand correctly Paraview needs connectivity information 
between the points to be able to do these things.  The Delaunay3D filter 
has been mentioned
recently on this list and from looking at the documentation the filter  
might provide the connectivity  information I need. My questions are:

1) Does the Delaunay3D filter seem applicable to my need for generating 
connectivity information between points in space?

2) Is there a reason the Delaunay3D filter was not included in ParaView

3) Could someone who has already implemented the necessary xml files to 
allow the Delaunay3D filter to be loaded by ParaView please
    post them (or send them to me) so I do not have to duplicate your 
work.  (I'll put in my IOU to do the same for others when I am up to speed
    with ParaView and VTK)

  Thanks in advance

I'll answer question 3 and let others do 1) and 2)

Just use "import package" to activate it.

Yes, but since your points are already a subset of a regular grid your 
adaptive sampling algorithm should be able to produce better 
connectivity.  If by "adaptive subset of a regular grid" you mean an 
octree, then it should be trivial to generate hexahedral cells for the 
octree leaves.

> 2) Is there a reason the Delaunay3D filter was not included in ParaView

I don't think there is a particular reason.  It just has not been 
commonly needed.

Subject: [Paraview] Need help with custom reader
Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.58.0503181501250.13071@sinclair.scorec.rpi.edu>


We have a custom reader that works fine in paraview 1.2. Since that seems
to be obsolete, I'm trying to migrate it to the current paraview.
So far, I have:
- copied my vtk classes to VTK/Hydrid
- updated VTK/Hybrid/CMakeList.txt (added reference to new .cxx files)

I've also modified GUI/Client/Resources/Readers.xml to add a <Module>
entry for my new reader.

After compiling, paraview crashes when I open a data file using my reader.
I can't find any documentation on the architecture changes between 1.2 and
1.8, so some pointers would be appreciated.

Thank you.

You also need to update Servers/ServerManager/Resources/readers.xml. 
There is now a book "The ParaView Guide:

http://www.kitware.com/products/paraviewguide.html

that explains some of this.

Subject: [Paraview] netCDF, Multiple outputs, multiple point data arrays
Message-ID: <423E640C.3090503@cscs.ch>

I'm working on a netCDF reader which is working well on the majority of 
datasets and will handle multiple point data arrays using the 
PointDataArraySelection method that can be found in several of the more 
advanced paraview readers. The Gui allows you to select which point data 
to read. In this case, all the Variables present in the netCDF file are 
basically the same size (identical x,y,z,t,spacing,origin etc)

But...
I've got some netCDF datasets that have mutiple Variables present in 
them - with different sizes. So that either of the above mentioned 
variables may be of different sizes. What I'd like to do, is create N 
outputs, each with possibly M point data arrays. Effectively, calling 
SetNumberOfOutputPorts in the execute information and assiging the 
relevent information to them.

Can the PointDataArraySelection method be extended to handle this case, 
so that the user can configure reads from the paraview GUI? if so, can 
anyone give me either an example or some clues as to what to modify. If 
this case can't be handled, then it's not too serious and I'll just 
output one (probably the largest) of the "sets" of data.

thanks

JB

Subject: [Paraview] KWWidgets / GUI updates
Message-ID: <6.2.1.2.2.20050321124420.02ff5150@pop.fr.clara.net>

Hi,

I sneaked in several hundreds small commits this week-end, so here is a 
little follow-up, in case your code is still conflicting with my changes, 
or if you are wondering what happened to a couple of classes or methods.

These changes are related to the ongoing effort to make KWWidgets (i.e. the 
PV/GUI/Widgets) a separate/standalone project. BTW, please refrain from 
putting anymore ParaView-related elements to Widgets/, add them to 
PV/GUI/Client instead. Thank you.

More infos can be found in PV/GUI/Widgets/README.txt

The commits were three-fold:

1) clean the vtkKWLabeled* widgets, i.e. a dozen or so classes that had 
more or less the same interface and needed to be unified/cleaned-up before 
they grow out of control. A "labeled widget" is a composite widget that 
allows developers to associate a label (vtkKWLabel) to another widget. 
Labeled widgets are now created automatically as subclasses of 
vtkKWWidgetLabeled by configuring some templates. They all follow the new 
classname pattern vtkKW*Labeled, and adopt the same API to manipulate the 
internal vtkKWLabel.

2) clean the vtkKW*Set widgets, i.e. again a good bunch of classes that had 
more or less the same interface and needed to be unified/cleaned-up before 
they grow out of control. A set of widgets is a basic container that allows 
developers to delegate allocation, deletion, creation and packing of 
multiple widgets to a single object called a set. Sets of widgets are 
useful in situations that require dynamic numbers of widgets. They can also 
be used to group related widgets together without maintaining ivars for 
each one of them. Sets of widgets are now created automatically as 
subclasses of vtkKWWidgetSet  by configuring some templates. The API to 
manipulate the widgets and control the layout has been unified.

3) the SetLabel(const char *) and SetText(const char *) methods were mixed 
and matched among the core widgets. Some buttons used SetLabel(), other 
SetText(). Some classes had inconsistent Set/Get pairs, e.g. vtkKWLabel* 
GetLabel(), and SetLabel(const char*). The SetText()  is now the only one 
in use for the core widgets. Composite widgets, including the labeled 
widgets mentioned above, may provide a SetLabelText() method as a shortcut 
to GetLabel()->SetText() for example.

Check the migrations notes in README.txt if you are lost, or contact me. 
This should be pretty straightforward though. Also check the Doxygen 
documentation:
	http://www.paraview.org/doc/nightly/html/classes.html

Hi All,

The initial release of ParaView 2.0 is available for download from 
ParaView's web site (http://www.paraview.org/HTML/Download.html).  Please 
be aware that the files containing the precompiled binaries for Linux are 
rather large (over 50 MB).  We are working on reducing the size of these

Hi everybody:
I have to use paraview to display the output of a finite element programs. I have to be able to describe deformed solids and to draw on their surfaces the stress and strain field (different colors for different values of strenght on the nodes of the mesh) I am reading the paraview guide but still I haven't found anything similar on it...
Do you know any solutions?
bye and thanks

giuseppe

Kent,

When you run the demo from the Help menu, a Tcl script called Demo1.pvs is 
called.  If you built ParaView from source, you can find this script in the 
ParaView/GUI/Demos directory.

I am still in the process of collecting a list of features and bug fixes 
for the ParaView 2.0 release, but here is what I have so far.

- The volume rendering editor has been completely reworked.
- Several fixes have been made to quadratic cells, especially for clip and 
cut to work properly.
- vtkDataSetSurfaceFilter now properly removes internal faces for 
penta/hexa wedges.
- The animation interface has been completely reworked.  Now it supports 
keyframe animation.  There is a "record" mode that stores and plays back 
user operations.  There is also a "real-time" playback mode so that the 
actual length of the animation can be specified, not just the length of 
time between frames.
- Sliders now allow users to edit values outside the current range.
- The connection (for connecting and disconnecting in client/server mode) 
button is now working.
- An "invalid operation value" has been added the calculator.

This isn't very easy because ParaView creates a whole bunch of internal 
objects according to the number of outputs the reader produces.  Once 
this is set it cannot be changed without removing the reader and 
creating a new one.  Therefore the set of outputs to read cannot be 
configured by the GUI.

Changing the number of output ports during execution is not a very 
new-pipeline thing to do.  There is currently multiblock (or composite) 
output support being developed, so you reader would produce one output 
that consists of several blocks.  Each block would correspond to one of 
what you are now calling outputs.

It looks like the paraview executable might be too big for that system. 
  Someone else has had a similar problem in another application:

http://www.mail-archive.com/xmame@toybox.twisted.org.uk/msg07077.html

You might be able to turn on BUILD_SHARED_LIBS to avoid such a large 
executable.  Otherwise try following the instructions in the above link 
and let us know.

(In case this needs correction...)

In paraview 1.8.3, I spotted what looks like a wee error.  vtkPVImplicitPlaneWidget::GetNormal() calls 
this->GetCenterInternal(), instead of this->GetNormalInternal().

 From vtkPVImplicitPlaneWidget.cxx
//----------------------------------------------------------------------------
void vtkPVImplicitPlaneWidget::GetNormal(double pt[3])
{
  if(!this->IsCreated())
    {
    vtkErrorMacro("Not created yet");

    }
  this->WidgetProxy->UpdateInformation();
  this->GetCenterInternal(pt);
}

Message-ID: <000001c5320f$608033c0$0eb603d5@CPQ21700315045>

Hi,

I want to visualize the outputs of a CFD code (solving a propeller for
ship problem) with ParaView. Data files are in text format (Ascii) and
they specify geometry (nodes coordinates of panels describing the
blade..), values of pressure on the blades, Velocity, .. . I have to
convert this files in a format that Paraview can accept and that is most
portable as possible.

What format file are the best for these specifics?

Is also possible to create into Paraview (or VTK) a script to translate
directly my output files?

 

thanks

Hi Gianluca,

I've been using Paraview to visualize the results of my program (a 3D
incompressible solver using finite element method). In attach follow the
routines that I've been using to export my geometry (tetrahedra mesh) and
result files (velocity vector, pressure and viscosity scalar fields) in
Ensight's format (I think this format is one of the most known format in CFD
area). I hope these routines may be useful for your purposes. 

You may also take a look in the ASCII example files provided with the
Paraview's distribution (C:\Program Files\ParaView 2.0\Data\Data, files
elements.***) for further details about the Ensight's format.

Giuseppe,

Everything you want to do (and more) to display
finite element structural analysis results is available
in ParaView.

The trick is to get your finite element method
software to write nodal(point) data and element(cell)
data to a file in a form that ParaView can read.

Try looking at http://www.vtk.org/pdf/file-formats.pdf

I have attached a Fortran-95 subroutine that writes
vtk xml-formatted files that ParaView reads. It might
be a little more complex than what you need since
I use ParaView's parallel read capability to read
individual files for each material in the mesh.

Hi everybody:
I have to use paraview to display the output of a finite element programs. I
have to be able to describe deformed solids and to draw on their surfaces
the stress and strain field (different colors for different values of
strenght on the nodes of the mesh) I am reading the paraview guide but still
I haven't found anything similar on it...
Do you know any solutions?

Depending on the data type, there are a few formats you can use:

1. Plot3D for curvilinear grids. ASCII or binary. Not great if running
in parallel
2. EnSight for all types. Not great if running in parallel
3. Legacy VTK (see VTK web site for the format). Not great in parallel
4. New (XML based) VTK (see VTK web site). Works in parallel

It is possible to write a small vtk script to do the conversion.
However, it would probably be more efficient to write a Fortran or
C/C++ program to do the conversion.

Thanks Amy for the explanation of key frames in ParaView 2.0.

   The one thing that I want to do is change the camera angle, and 
possibly zoom in, as the animation progresses.
This is important to convey the 3D nature of the data when showing 
complex simulation results.  Do I interpret the last line of your 
explanation:

>> Also, presently Camera cannot be animated. So recording doesn't save 
>> camera changes.

as saying this capability is not available in ParaView 2.0?  If it can 
be done, can you give a short explanation of how to accomplish this?

  Thank you

Subject: [Paraview] Polyhedron Cells
Message-ID: <s2480558.068@co.mgn.netl.doe.gov>

Hi all,

I am working with a group of folks that are developing computational
fluid dynamics (CFD) software.  They plan on using an unstructured grid
with polyhedron cells.  We have done some preliminary tests by creating
unstructured grids with polyhedron (ConvexPointSet) cells in the vtk
file format.  This method works, but when the cell counts are large, it
can take minutes for Paraview to load the data.  I tried the same data
that was meshed with tetrahedrons and it loaded within a few seconds.

Does anyone have any ideas on how I can speed the load time up when
loading large polyhedron data sets?

Thanks in advance,

Yes, that is what I am saying.  In the current release of ParaView, you 
cannot animate the camera.

Hello all.

I'm trying to understand the hierarchy of the paraview class.
I know that paraview can be divided into 4 parts: 
Client, Server Manager, Data server and  Render server.

But how to get the specific information about the class relationship? 

(ps: the information about any version is ok.)

Best regards,

Hi,

I have been using paraview for about a year and have some feedback 
regarding stream traces:
1. An option on the right-click object menu to replicate the current 
object would really be useful.
2. Confine to plane/surface option for generating streamlines on a surface.
3. Streamline from a single point option.
4. Ability to pick points (for cloud, lines and point line sources) via 
a widget similar to the one that picks the centre of rotation.

Thanks for a really great tool.

Hello!

I'm trying to use the .pvtr file format to visualize a vector field 
associated to a rectilinear grid. Unfortunately I get not the expected 
result. I have two .vtr files which are connected via a .pvtr file. I'm 
trying to visualize the datasets using only one instance of ParaView. 
Maybe this is a problem? It seems to me, that the data from the second 
vtr file is read and displayed incorrect. I will provide you a short 
example to reproduce the problem. The dataset consists of  a vectorfield 
distributed on two vtr files. The values in the first file contains a 
field pointing only in x-direction and the second file contains field 
values pointing only in y-direction.

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance

Felix

The data server is where computation takes place, the render server is
where rendering of the geometry takes place.  The server manager is a
library to aid writing clients.  The Client is a desktop GUI that links
to the server manager at build time and uses it at runtime to contact
the data and render servers.  Optionally the data and render servers can
be in the same process, or all three (client, data, and render) in one
process.

For small data on a single machine just running "paraview" will load all
components in the same process.  On a network some machines can be
designated data/render servers and then one machine running the GUI can
connect to the servers.

More information is available in the "ParaView Guide":

Eugene,

What version of ParaView are you using?  Items 3 and 4 have been available 
since at least version 1.2 of ParaView, released in February of last 
year.  (The current release is 2.0, available for download from the 
ParaView web site: www.paraview.org.)

For item 3, after you have selected the streamline filter, make sure the 
seed is a point cloud, and set the Radius to 0 and the Number of Points to 
1.  For item 4, a point widget is available to help you with these 
tasks.  For example, when streamlining with a point cloud, a point widget 
is displayed showing the center of the point cloud.  It can be 
interactively dragged with the mouse to a new location within the data 
set.  Make sure the Visibility check box (at the bottom of the Seed part of 
the interface) is checked.

- Amy

When using multiple pieces like this they must have well-defined 
boundaries.  The X extent "1 2" means there are two points with a cell 
between them.  The X extent "3 4" means this also, but shifted over 2 
units.  Defining the two pieces this way leaves a missing cell between 
points 2 and 3.  The reader should produce an error message to indicate 
this.  You need the extents to overlap by one point such as "1 2" and "2 3".

Are you using the .vtu file format (new VTK XML format) or a .vtk file 
(legacy VTK format)?

Please try to send me a small example of a polyhedral input file and 
corresponding tetrahedral input file with a noticable time difference. 
Just send it to me privately to avoid cluttering the list with big files.

Thanks,

Hi Amy,

I am using 1.85.
Re item 3, can I set the default radius to 0 and no of points to 1?
Re 4, I was referring to how the centre of rotation picker positions the 
point on a surface.

None of these things are a major concern really.

In response to Brad:
Just to confirm, if I have a suggestion, I should report it as a bug?
Will do.

Eugene

Thank you for your suggestion. Unfortunately ParaView doesn't display 
the dataset correct even when I change the files as you suggested. Apart 
from that I don't understand, how this should work. When I specify two 
pieces one with the extend "1 2 1 2 1 2" and the other with extend "2 3 
1 2 1 2" it seems to me as if the point with index 2 in x-direction is 
duplicated. In which datafile should the point data for this point be or 
should both datafiles contain the data for this point? It would be 
great, if you would have any additional suggestion how to make ParaView 
read and display the data correctly (or even better: a working pvtr 
example file to learn how to create such a data file correctly). I 
append the modified small example files to this text. By the way: 
ParaView doesn't show a error message, when it reads the files (with and 
without the changes)

Thanks in advance

Felix

Message-ID: <BAY14-F387DE9104727E5F93DF18BD5460@phx.gbl>

As you might guess, I'm having problems getting this to build with a Nvidia 
Nforce2 equipped motherboard.

A few attempts have yielded...

Building executable /home/paraview/bin/GraphicsCxxTests...
/usr/X11R6/lib/libMesaGL.so: undefined reference to `_nv000996gl'
/usr/X11R6/lib/libMesaGL.so: undefined reference to `_nv000919gl'
....for several hundred lines including one like this....
/usr/lib/libGLcore.so.1: undefined reference to `glBlendEquationSeparateNVX'
...and several hundred lines more `nv0000xxxx`, then install messages ending 
with...

/home/paraview/Utilities/SPCTH/cmake_install.cmake:4:
FILE cannot find file: /home/paraview/bin/libSPCTH.so to install.
make: *** [install] Error 255

Thinking this was somehow Nvidia and openGL related because of that "NVX", I 
switched to non-Nvidia gl.h files, and got...

(I don't understand this message "File format not recognized" -- I gave a

to be expecting a shared object file.)

Another attempt yielded

is:  what versions are needed for things Paraview source tree does not 
supply?

They have to have the same data for the duplicate points.  The idea is 
that if the two files are loaded on different machines without shared 
memory they need to have valid boundary conditions to achieve a 
consisent computation.

There should be a little red exclamation point in the lower right hand 
corner when an error occurs.  Clicking on it should bring up the messages.

Hi John,

For the variables you listed, if CMake is for a directory (e.g., 
OPENGL_INCLUDE_DIR), then you should provide the path to that 
directory.  If it asks for a library (e.g., OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY), then it 
wants the full path and file name for the library file (e.g., 
/usr/lib/opengl/nvidia/lib/libGL.so).  This may not entirely fix your 
problem, but at least you'll be giving CMake the appropriate information.

Hi,

I loaded some volume data, a .vtk file into  paraview2,
and I want to volume render it.

I can only see the iso surface method in the GUI,

Can I do proper volume rendering with ray casting and or texture 
mapping?

cheers
Dan

Thank you again for your explanations. I have modified the datafiles as 
you suggested (with duplicated point values at the boundaries). But 
ParaView doesn't display the data correctly. The outline displayed by 
the dataset is wrong and when I choose to set glyphs onto the datapoints 
only the data from the first file seems to be used.
I know the red exclamation point in the lower right corner of the GUI, 
but it doesn't appear, even with the wrong datafiles containing no 
duplicated point values. I will again enclose the simple example pvtr 
and vtr files in the hope that you or someone else can help me to get 
this working.

Greetings

 Felix

Hi Dan,

ParaView only handles unstructured volume rendering, so your data must be 
an unstructured grid for ParaView to volume render it.  It must also be 
composed only of tetrahedral cells and contain a point-centered scalar 
(single-component) array.

Hi Amy,

Seems rather odd....
why not just use the VTK volume renderers on
the usual kinds of data like structured grids and image stacks...?

Why only unstructured grids?

Hi Dan,

This issue is that we don't want to compete with ourselves.  VolView, a 
Kitware-produced proprietary application supports structured volume 
rendering, and putting the same functionality into our own open-source 
application didn't make much sense to us.

Message-ID: <D9A8D98DDC682044806D5B46AF5C11E207EDD4@ARLABML01.DS.ARL.ARMY.MIL>

Let me elaborate on my previous question. I am trying to create a new
Paraview Filter that is a combination of two filters, a cut
(vtkCutter) and pick filter (vtkPickFilter). My goal is a cutplane
filter that creates a cutplane by selecting (picking) three points. 
Here are two questions: 

1. If I use xml modules to create a ParaView filter module using
vtkPickfilter, then I can add any xml widget to the client-side. For
example I can add the following:

<!-- add widget for cutplane  menu  --> 
<SelectWidget label="Cut Function"
    trace_name="Cut Function"
    property="CutFunction">
    <Item label="Plane"
          value="Plane">
          <ImplicitPlaneWidget 
               trace_name="Plane"
               use_label="0"
               input_menu="im1"
               help="Adjusts the parameters of the plane to cut with."/>
    </Item>
</SelectWidget>

<!-- add widget for picking  -->
<SelectWidget 
    label="Point Selection"
    trace_name="PickMethod"
    property="UseIdToPick">
    <!-- add point widget -->
    <Item label="World Point" 
          value="0">
          <PointWidget 
	       trace_name="Point" 
               variable="WorldPoint"
               help="Pick closest point."/>
    </Item>
</SelectWidget>

However on the server-side, I can only access the routines that are
define in vtkPickfilter, like AddInput. I want access to vtkCutter
routines as well, like SetInput.  Any pointers on how this is done?


2. I created a new class vtkPV3PointCut that inherits PVSource in
/Gui/Client directory of ParaView source tree. Since I can only use
one filter in the client Filters.xml and server filters.xml modules, I
used vtkPickfilter and follow the vtkPVPick implementation.  I then
declare an instance of vtkCutter and attempt to initialize it in
vtkPV3PointCut. However, I am not sure how to get the the Input from
the vtkPickfilter used in the xml modules to initialize the vtkCutter
in the C++ code.  Any pointers on how this is done?

Any suggestions?

Subject:	[Paraview] Filters
I am trying to create a new Paraview Filter that is a combination of
two filters, a cut (vtkCutter) and pick filter (vtkPickFilter).  My
goal is a cutplane filter that creates a cutplane by selecting
(picking) three points.  

I can create each filter independently, however joining them has been a
problem.  Say I create a cutplane filter, how do I get the inputs from
the cutplane filter to initialize the pick filter or vise versa? 

Thanks,

Jose

All,

The only constraint on the volume rendering is unstructured grid. The current mappers will automatically tetralhedralize if necessary and you can render cell centered data as well (I believe Moreland added that a few months ago). Also if you have structured data you can do the silly thing of running the 'Tetrahedralize' filter on it and then of course you'll have unstructured data... :) 

The whole "...not competing with VolView..." is an issue that I'm not going to touch with a ten foot pole. :)

Also be aware that the volume rendering in ParaView is very much a work in progress, upcoming versions will have parallel, faster, higher quality techniques that Kitware and Sandia (and Utah for that matter) are currently working on.

Don,

These methods may not be an 'formal' as you would like, but they are
quite easy and useful

1) Use calc to compute mag of vector and then apply 'Threshold' filter
on the mag scalar array and threshold out the vectors with smaller
magnitudes

AND/OR

2) Use the 'Mask Points' filter (with Random on) on the dataset and then
glyph the result of mask points.

Ahh... Silly me... Method 2 is what I used before that functionality was
combined with the glyph filter. :)

Message-ID: <1C9DF24066AF954A8234B3C9AF5026A65B2584@webmail.imi.nrc.ca>

Hi,

I just switched to Paraview 2.0 and I'm no longer able to animate my solutions.  I found Utkarsh's description of the new animation interface in the discussion list, but this did not quite help me (though I was able to animate the sphere as described).

To make it short, I have a series of data in Ensight Gold format (a .case file with some .dat files) from a Finite Element simulation.  I would like to show each set of data in one frame and make an animation.  In the Animation Tracks window, I only have access to the following "tracks":
ByteOrder
CaseFileName
SetTimeValue

How can I tell Paraview to show me one set of data per frame?

Thank you!
Jean-Philippe

Hi,

Apparently, there is a bug in ParaView 2.0.
I will look at it at the earliest possible.
