I confirm this in ParaView  3.12.0 (git version) (linux 64-bit).

Subject: [Paraview] Interpreting the deformation field
Message-ID: <CAAmZ4=W-je3CDS=jeO3U0tTJb4visv5Q9gDdT17r0DdBxSrKAw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I just used ITK to perform a simple registration.
Fixed image contains a white circle at the center and moving image contains
an ellipse.
I registered the image using BSplinetransformation and saved the
deformation field (.mhd).
I tried to visualize the deformation field using glyph in paraview and
limitting the number points to 1000.
I had this result (attached, result.png). How to interprete this result?
What's the color and arrows means?

Thanks in advance,
Ryo

I wonder why it makes a difference to add the elevation filter for 
you.  I don't know what that filter does.

Even when I add elevation in 3.12.0 64-bit Windows version, it only 
gives me RTdata, not Elevation, after the contour is 
applied.  Strangely, if I contour by RTData after applying Elevation 
it also gives me only RTdata and not Elevation as a choice.  Maybe it 
is just skipping one of the entries in the contour?

Thanks,
Russ

Hi All,
I am new to ParaView and VTK/ITK and I want to use them for my thesis. I
have compiled ParaView and VTK from source on my Windows machine
successfully and currently working through the examples. Now I want to do
image registration on two images and interactive select some feature points
for comparison. Please, I need some advice on how to achieve these base on
your experience.
I will be very thankful.
Ibrahim.

I wrote a program similar to Matlab's cpselect that allows you to
select 2D or 3D control points. Here it is:

This is probably a question for the ITK mailing list.

On that list someone will surely be able to explain it in mathematical
terms. To me, the glyphs look like they represent the direction and
magnitude of the transfer function from the values at the pixels in
the input image to those in output image.

Alan,

This issue has been fixed in git-next. We'll have it merged into
master soon. The user is shown options to change the precision and
using scientific notation when saving data as CSV.

Subject: [Paraview] Problem with Slice filter via Script
Message-ID: <CAMJouB5Ne-DDzTSSfvaKZZSbwxTc5UsNjmpTte78CySO4AbC8g@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I am writing a Python script to automatically generate a few (approximately
5-10) slices through a volume dataset (Image data--uniform grid). Each time
I attempt to use my Python script to generate the slices, set the origin
and normal vectors, the Qt GUI of Paraview 3.12.2 (Win32 binaries) app
crashes with an exception pointing to the vtkVolumeRendering DLL (read
access violation).  This problem is repeatable.

However, when I attempt to create the slices manually (with the GUI) I am
able to create them without issue.  Does anyone know what might be causing
this problem? Am I missing something in the script?

Here is a snippet of my code that I know to be the trouble spot ("r" as a
PVDReader object already in place):
____________________________________
....
        tempSlice=Slice(r)
 tempSlice.SliceType.Origin=[temp.org_x, temp.org_y, temp.org_z]
 tempSlice.SliceType.Normal = [temp.norm_x, temp.norm_y, temp.norm_z]
Show(tempSlice)
        ....

Thanks,
DJ

Message-ID: <CAMLX94yxZQeN=Rixuzc5k_G--HVYcNUx9x6SpjKcu0k337oc9w@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,

I seem to have a problem with the ParaView version 3.12.0-1190, 64
bit. The states work ok but the moment I add some Plot Over Line
filters reloading of the state fails with the message:
X Error: BadColor (invalid Colormap parameter) 12
 Major opcode: 1 (X_CreateWindow)
 Resource id:  0x5e00001

and hangs ParaView completely. I am sure I was using Plot Over Line
together with states in the past.

I would be obliged for any comments.

Best wishes,
Robert

Hi, 

For Paraview Web, if I have to extend the capacities of paraview using plug
in for server side render, we can write scripts and put that under plugin
folder of PW.plugins correct! Can these scripts be written in Python as well
as c++ ? in case of c++ do I need to have any compiler or enable something
on paraview web / vtk wrap ?

I didn't had success in putting a cpp file and access it thru Paraview
Plugin using JS, however Python files work fine. Am I doing anything wrong?
Let me know the pre-requisites for C++ paraview plug-in.

Please help.

Thanks, 
Anand

Hi Anand,

ParaViewWeb is a technology that is already available which leverage
ParaView capability for data processing and visualization. As ParaView
is based on top of VTK, basically any VTK pipeline can be achieved.
ParaViewWeb provides access to ParaView's proxy directly through the
JavaScript or if you prefer on the server side through python plugins
that get automatically wrapped to JavaScript objects.

ParaViewWeb use JavaScript in the web browser, Java for the web server
and Python and C++ for the processing and rendering.

I'm sorry to say that, but there is not a strait answer to your
question. It will mainly depend on what you want to achieve and how.
In any case, ParaViewWeb could already provide you all you need, but
if not, you can still extend it to make it match.

Seb

Hi Anand,

For the C++ code, it has to be a ParaView plugin. And as part of that
you will have to load the ParaView (c++) plugin from your ParaViewWeb
(python) plugin with a command similar to that:

import paraview
paraview.simple.LoadPlugin("/.../libYourParaViewPlugin.so", False)

Moreover, such type of initialization where you load a bunch of
plugins can be automatically setup at the startup of PWServer. But
this is just a matter of deployment setting.

Hello !

Just on Question to you, in the manual i read that for VRPlugin it's
required to use BUILD_SHARED_LIB  OFF
but I use BUILD_SHARED_LIB ON  .  i tryed then to use shared lib but
this gives me an error in the compiling procedure.
(also i use QT 4.7 instead off 4.6.3 recommendet) . If i should give you
more detail about what went wrong i can tell you
in a seperate mail .
My indent is to use VRPN devices in a 4 wall cave enviroment .


thank you

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView-3.12.0 SuperBuild: trouble with zlib on Linux &
	OS-X
Message-ID: <CA+1ZiDai4dJrmZc4rtB_=y5sJUVHu+t-0+x7VzB0feVcUm+YtQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I'm getting stuck while building zlib for the ParaView-3.12.0 SuperBuild on
Linux & OS-X.  Here's what I did:


   - Download & extract ParaView-3.12.0 source
   - From a new build directory execute
   ccmake ../ParaView-3.12.0/SuperBuild
   make
   - I had to fix a few MD5 sums:  BOOST_MD5; SZIP_MD5; ZLIB_MD5.  This
   seems to match what I found from the unofficial ParaView dev install
   project
   http://code.google.com/p/unofficial-paraview-dev-install/wiki/Notes3120

Boost and szip build, but I get an error with zlib:

> [ 13%] Performing build step for 'zlib'
>
cd /home/paraview/paraview/ParaView-3.12.0-Linux-x86_64/zlib && make

make[3]: Entering directory

> make[1]: Leaving directory
> '/home/paraview/paraview/ParaView-3.12.0-Linux-x86_64'
> make: *** [all] Error 2


I get to the same point when building for both Linux and OS-X 10.7
I don't have much experience with CMake and must be doing something silly.
 Does anyone have an idea of things to try?

Thanks!
Pete

The zlib folks released a new version this past week and took the old
one that super build brought in down.

We'll post a copy of the old one somewhere on kitware.com and change
super build to grab from there shortly. In the longer term we will
update to the next zlib which didn't work for us right off the bat
when we tried it.

Jageet,

Attached is patch to a bug that got introduced in 3.12. I've pushed it
to git and it will be included in 3.14. This was causing the issue
that you were seeing with 3.12. Thanks for bringing this to our
attention.

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView-3.12.0 SuperBuild on OS-X Lion
Message-ID: <CA+1ZiDYKMPwQpvr7nwn575BNaALSWeZ5a758N9tFyya1HR-N-Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I have a clean install of OS-X 10.7.2 "Lion".  I've installed xcode-4.2.1
from the App store.  When building ParaView from SuperBuild with
CMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.5, I get the following error:

[ 75%] Building CXX object

I see there are a few copies of malloc.h on my system:

/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.6.sdk/usr/include/malloc/malloc.h
> /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.7.sdk/usr/include/malloc/malloc.h

/usr/include/malloc/malloc.h  # same as the 10.7 malloc above


 and I am guessing the SuperBuild is pointing to the wrong one.  Any ideas
of how to get around this?  If my goal is to create a 3.12.0 development
install, should I be using OS-X 10.7 with XCode 4.2.1?

Thanks,
Pete

Disable the Manta plugin, or apply this patch to the Manta directory
in the superbuild.

Subject: [Paraview] Strange problem Paraview plug-in compilation with VS 2008
Message-ID: <CAJxf0dDJhEY3DTfUkpyZ_Ngkf0CD-8HWBpi2Y7Jcm4DR1cQa_A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi ALL,

I am facing a strange problem with my ParaView 3.12 "Plugin" compilation.
My Paraview 3.12 build with VS2008 was ok and I am successfully able to run
Paraview client.

However when I tries to compile Example plugin, I gets below error. and
this problem is not plugin specific, i get same error with any example
compilation.


CMake Error at C:/Users/Paraview/Documents/Visual Studio
2008/Projects/ParaView-3.12.0Build/VTK/ParaViewTargets.cmake:16
(ADD_EXECUTABLE):

add_executable cannot create imported target "vtkEncodeString" because

another target with the same name already exists.

Call Stack (most recent call first):

C:/Users/ Paraview/Documents/Visual Studio
2008/Projects/ParaView-3.12.0Build/VTK/VTKConfig.cmake:243 (INCLUDE)

(FIND_PACKAGE)

C:/Users/Paraview/Documents/Visual Studio
2008/Projects/ParaView-3.12.0/ParaViewUse.cmake:9 (FIND_PACKAGE)

CMakeLists.txt:10 (INCLUDE)


Another thing to note is that there is no such problem in Linux build.

Any pointers to the problem will be greatly appreciated.

with regards

Jagjeet

Hello !

Just on Question to you, in the manual i read that for VRPlugin it's
required to use BUILD_SHARED_LIB OFF
but I use BUILD_SHARED_LIB ON . i tryed then to use shared lib but this
gives me an error in the compiling procedure.
(also i use QT 4.7 instead off 4.6.3 recommendet) . If i should give
you more detail about what went wrong i can tell you
in a seperate mail .
My indent is to use VRPN devices in a 4 wall cave enviroment .

Little correction: Below problem is not at the compile time, it is at the
solution file generation time with CMake.

Try putting both the ParaView source and build directory into the same
partition. I've seen errors like this in the past which were caused by a
build directory whose path involved a symbolic link to a different mount
point.

Hi Sven ! 

Ok i will do right now i'm downloadind from git. But the Idea of
referencing a link witch is mounted on a defent directory is very good
becouse exactly this is the case. 

thank you

Hello,

I'm following the SC'10 tutorial with the help of the VTK doxygen, but I
don't understand how to do the following:

I have a 3D rectilinear grid which coordinates are defined by mesh_x,
mesh_y and mesh_z (float arrays of dimensions PX, PY and PZ). I have a
variable "temperature" defined as a 3D array representing the temperature
at each point of the grid. Currently I have followed the slides 24 and 25
from the SC'10 tutorial, at some point vtkDataObjects have to be created,
here is how I created the grid object :

// This function is called to retrieve the mesh
vtkObject* wrapMeshData()
{
  vtkFloatArray* xCoords, yCoords, zCoords;
  xCoords = vtkFloatArray::New();
  xCoords->setArray(mesh_x,PTX,1);
  yCoords = vtkFloatArray::New();
  yCoords->setArray(mesh_y,PTY,1);
  zCoords = vtkFloatArray::New();
  zCoords->setArray(mesh_z,PTZ,1);
  vtkRectilinearGrid *grid = vtkRectilinearGrid::New();
  grid->setDimensions(PTX,PTY,PTZ);
  grid->setXCoordinates(xCoords);
  grid->setYCoordinates(yCoords);
  grid->setZCoordinates(zCoords);
  return (vtkObject*)grid;
}

Now I want to make a function that retrieves the temperature so that I can
map each data value to each point of the mesh, something like :

vtkDataObject* wrapTemperature() {
  // ???
}

How can I do that without copying the original array that I want to wrap?
Also what functions do I then call from the vtkCPDataDescription object?
(on the tutorial they call SetGrid, I guess there is something else to call
for the temperature field)

Thank you for your help,

Matthieu

Hey !
 
Just finished downloading from git . Put source directory and build
directory onto one partion --> YESSSS it works 

but  i get a new problem at the end of make (i had to enable VRPlugin
becouse i have cave environment) 

error was:

Try putting both the ParaView source and build directory into the same
partition. I've seen errors like this in the past which were caused by
a
build directory whose path involved a symbolic link to a different
mount
point.

It looks like vtkSMProxyManager's API for GetProxy("name") was removed
just before 3.12 in favor of the GetProxy("name", "group") signature
and the VR Plugin wasn't updated.

Christian, will you please try this patch and see if it works for your setup?

Message-ID: <4F303686.10102@lbl.gov>

Dear all:

I'm trying to use a small script to automatically load a state and create an image. Here it is:

The script runs well, but the created file is all black except for the axes etc. I'm running Linux. Any help would be highly appreciated.

There was a bug in the past with GetRenderView() that I'm sure has
been fixed  for a while. Not sure, if you're running into it. Try this
instead:

Many thanks for your help, Utkarsh.

I have tried your solution, but I get "TypeError: 'RenderView' object does not support indexing".

However, thanks to your comment I moved to 3.12 (I was running 3.10), and now everything works fine.

A thousand thanks!

Martin

I'm sure typed "GetRenderView" instead of "GetRenderViews" (notice the
's'). In any case, glad it's working.

Subject: [Paraview] @executable_path when deploying custom plugins for OSX
Message-ID: <CA+1ZiDb2PsQ1qNAYgi_uu2n1Pu-jp6mwK3oymk2LYR+aNwjA0w@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I have built ParaView-3.12.0 from the SuperBuild.  Using otool, I noticed
that libraries had a hard-coded path to each shared library in the build
directory (otool -L ParaView-build/bin/libvtkPVServerManager.dylib).
 However, after `make install`, I noticed each library was prefixed with
@executable_path (otool -L /usr/local/ParaView\
3.12.0.app/Contents/Libraries/libvtkPVServerManager.dylib).  I would like
to apply the same transformation to any custom plugins I have compiled.
 However, my plugin doesn't have a 'make install' target.  It looks like I
can manually update my plugin dylib via calls to

       install_name_tool -change /full/path/to/libfoo.dylib
@executable_path/../Libraries/libfoo.dylib libBar.dylib

but there has to be a better way.  The `make install` target from
SuperBuild suggests that the "fixup_bundle" updates the libraries
appropriately.  How do I apply the same transformation for my custom plugin?

Thanks!
Pete

fixup_bundle is a cmake 2.8 feature that internally just runs
install_name_tool on Mac like you are considering doing manually.
I believe it is only tied the install target but I might be wrong on
that, ask on the cmake list.

See the ParaViewPlugins.cmake and Superbuild/CMakeLists.txt for how
our plugins get the install target hooked in.

Message-ID: <CAKbSO=vnqXOGh7rnKfXAZ3D3kCBD_Cms7=0gJ3vQpSf5VeneuA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I am trying to read spherical co-ordinate data directly from cdf files to
paraview and after reading various posts here I believe I should be using
vtkCSCSNetcdf reader. But I have gone through many posts and am still
unable to get a clear idea of how to compile this and build along with
paraview. I will be highly obliged if you could please explain the steps as
I am quite a novice at builds. I did build paraview once but when it comes
to complicated instructions I get stuck!
Thanks
Leo

I replied off list already, but just for the benefit of other searchers ....

Paraview has support for netCDF files using classes which are part of the core VTK/ParaView distribution and vtkCSCSNetCDF should not be used any more.

Message-ID: <F9562F3B302F29479A203FC5AF9E3E0505B612@SERBE4I1.intra.erbe-med.de>

Hi,

I am rather new to Paraview and have used it so far to view binary vtu files generated by the Elmer FEM software.

Now I have received results files generated by SEMCAD. They are in vtr format (ASCII) and rather large. The problem is that Paraview crashes immediately without error message. I use Paraview 3.12.0 on Win XP. When I try it with 3.12.0-RC2, it loads the file, but crashes when I do a "clip" and move the section plane. In my despair, I have tried with Visit, which seems to load the file, but I cannot view any plot (I must say that this was my first attempt to use Visit.

Is there anything I can do to handle those files and/or fidn the reason why Paraview crashes? Are there binaries of newer (development) versions of Paraview which I could try, where the vtr reader might be more robust?

Thanks for a helpful hint,

Matthias

P.S.: Unfortunately the vtr files are too large (30 MB to 500 MB) to attach one of them here.

The data may just be too large for your machine (especially when Clip
produces unstructured grids from your input rectilinear grid data).

Are you using a 32 or 64 bit version of windows XP and how much RAM
does your machine have?  What does View->Statistics inspector (or
alternatively the information tab) say about the memory size, number
of cells and number of arrays in this data set?

If you are exceeding memory, the solution is either to:
1) try more memory thrifty filter alternatives such as Slice or
Extract Subset rather than Clip (see the Best Practices section of the
user guide).
2) connect the client to a parallel paraview server and load the data there.

Hi David,

thank you for the answer.

My Machine has 3.46 GB of RAM. I use the 32 bit versions of WIN XP and Paraview. The statistics inspector (in 3.12.0-RC2) says for a 204 MB file:
5578650 cells, 5680752 points, 244,104 MB memory, 19,184 MB geometry size.

So it doesn't seem to me that memory is the issue here.
I will check if I can upload one of the files, as Utkarsh suggested.

Matthias

David ! 


YESSS that worket i can link now and open an display on all walls.  
But still there are things i dont understand Build_Shared_LIB  gives me
an error while BUILD_SHAERED_LIB OFF is ok seems there a a version of a
library  somewhere (but not in LD_LIBRARY_PATH) 
is taken but wrong .Have to find out whats the name of this library. 

The Display is OK with small amount of Data if i try a bigger than
standard sources (arror line etc)  i get only half of the dataset
displayed without any warning of Memory failuere etc ? 
Do you now what is maybe the case ??? 


thank you

It looks like vtkSMProxyManager's API for GetProxy("name") was removed
just before 3.12 in favor of the GetProxy("name", "group") signature
and the VR Plugin wasn't updated.

Christian, will you please try this patch and see if it works for your
setup?

Can anyone point me to a filter in paraview (or plain VTK for that matter) that correctly updates its progress based on the progress of an internal filter. I'd like to cut'n'paste how it's done to save myself time doing it from scratch.

That's exactly what I want, I just can't find an example that already does it to cut'n'paste from. I looked at contour filter etc because I know they use specialized internal filters, but I couldn't fin dsomewhere to copy from to save myself doing it from scratch.

Hi Matthieu,

Please respond to the whole list so that everyone can share in the
conversation.

When you start to get into parallel with the structured grids, I suggest
you play around a bit with running pvserver in parallel, connect to it with
the GUI, and play with some of the sources like Wavelet and Mandelbrot.

As for comparisons with VisIt's in-situ visualization.  We are working on
getting interaction through the GUI to process the data directly coming out
of the simulation without hitting the disk but it's not ready yet.  There
would be 2 use cases for that.  The first is where it stops the simulation
and waits for the user to finish their viz/analysis, i.e. like VisIt.  The
second would be where the user changes the outputting pipeline while the
simulation code is running.  The simulation code keeps running while the
user is setting up new pipelines and the changes don't take effect until
the next opportunity after the user adds their new pipeline or changes
parameters to their existing pipeline.  Our design started working with the
use case that the user would submit their simulation+coprocessing as a
batch job.  This makes sense if the simulation code is "fast".  For
example, one of the simulation codes that we've been working with, PHASTA
led by Ken Jansen at UC Boulder, is able to do an implicit time step solve
(I believe it's implicit but don't quote me on that) in less than a second
for a problem with hundreds of millions of unknowns.  We've done this with
up to 160,000 cores.  While ParaView can still process that efficiently for
many filters, it may take the user minutes to actually examine the data.
That's obviously going to be a major waste of computational power if the
supercomputer is waiting on the user before computing the next time step.
In this case, the predefined pipeline works very well in that it completes
the requested coprocessing and immediately gives control back to the
simulation code to continue its processing.  Hopefully this makes sense.

I've inlined some comments below to make sure that I address your questions.

Yes, this is the current situation where you should consider the pipelines
that are created by the script generator gui plugin to be static and to
only output data files and screenshot images.  You can modify the scripts
to add in better control though.  We also are working on allowing the user
to change the pipeline but I don't know when this will be ready.

This is also in the works where the data set or some subset of it will be
staged from the compute cluster to a viz cluster for the user to interact
with the "current" result.  This will get done over the network and once
the data has been passed to the viz cluster, the compute cluster can
continue on with simulation computations, if that's what the user desires.

That's exactly what I want, I just can't find an example that already does it to cut'n'paste from. I looked at contour filter etc because I know they use specialized internal filters, but I couldn't fin dsomewhere to copy from to save myself doing it from scratch.

Hi Matthias,

I've downloaded your vtr file and it opened it with my build of
paraview (Linux, 64bit, git-master). The file opens and the clip
filter works as expected. The memory usage for ParaView is 1-1.5GB so
I don't think lack of memory on your machine is an issue.

I also tried it with the 3.12 binaries from paraview.org and
everything worked as expected.

Perhaps this is a Windows issue?

Thanks,
Kyle

Hi Kyle,

thank you for looking at the file.

I don't know if it is a Windows issue - unfortunately, I don't have the possibility to use a Linux machine here although I would love to... ;)

Do you have the possibility to test the file on a Windoze machine?

What would be your guess why 3.12-RC2 opens the file on my machine, while 3.12 (release) doesn't?

Would you say that Paraview is less stable under Windoze than under Linux?
Would it make sense that I try a development snapshot of Paraview? If so, I would need a binary since I don't have a C++ compiler on my machine...

Thank you,

Matthias

1-1.5GB is enough to get an out of memory on 32 bit windows if the
memory is for the image needs to be allocated in a single buffer. This
is a result of address space fragmentation and the default 2GB maximum
address space limit per process.

Maybe - but why doesn't 3.12-RC2 crash at file load?
With 3.12-RC2, I can open a 204 MB file (the file I have uploaded has 29 MB). Paraview will only crash when I start to play around with the clip filter, it then takes some 0.9 GB of memory. With the 29 MB file and one clip filter, I see 424 MB of memory usage in the task manager. When I move the clip plane, the memory usage grows to some 0.8 GB, and Paraview crashes.
But 3.12.0 will crash immediately when I try to load any of the vtr files.

So IMHO memory is at least not the only issue here.

Subject: [Paraview] troubles with pipeline asynchronous update
Message-ID: <4F314D80.3080808@ismb.it>

Hi all,

I'm developing a GUI based on Qt+ParaView 3.10.0 to control a CNC 
acquisition system using Paraview builtin server. I have written a 
plugin that waits until new data is available, this process may require 
a lot of time; to avoid to block the entire interface I update the 
pipeline, which contains the plugin, from a QThread like so:

*** SourceUpdateTask.h ***

class SourceUpdateTask : public QRunnable{
public:
     SourceUpdateTask(const QString& id, pqPipelineSource* source);
     virtual ~SourceUpdateTask();

     void run();
protected:
     QString m_id;
     pqPipelineSource *m_source;
};

*** SourceUpdateTask.cpp ***

SourceUpdateTask::SourceUpdateTask(const QString& id, pqPipelineSource* 
source): m_id(id), m_source(source) {}
SourceUpdateTask::~SourceUpdateTask() {}

void SourceUpdateTask::run(){
     m_source->updatePipeline();
}

In this way the interface remains functional (it is possible to resize 
and repaint it and the pqStatusBar receives the progress event 
correctly) but it seems that each other qt signals are not processed 
(all qt widgets are blocked) as if the updatePipeline function locked 
the qt event loop. At the end of the function the interface return to 
work correctly.

Can anyone tell me if it is "safe" to update pipelines in this way. Is 
there another way to do an asynchronous update?

Thanks in advance,
Nadir

Probably not safe, you need to update the pipeline on the main paraview gui thread

  if (this->Internals->TcpNotificationSocket) {
    this->connect(this->Internals->TcpNotificationSocket, 
      SIGNAL(readyRead()), SLOT(onNotified()), Qt::QueuedConnection);
    this->Internals->TcpNotificationServer->close();
  }

Note use of Qt::QueuedConnection - in the panel/other handler you can then call update. This should ensure that you don't call update inside a thread whilst paraview is doing an update already somewhere else.

I've tried and was able to reproduce the crash on WinXP-32bit with
ParaView-3.12. I then compiled ParaView from git-master (SHA: 818a8e9)
and the file could be opened succesfully. Could you try compiling
ParaView from the git? If not, ParaView 3.14 should be released this
month and should work.

Cheers,
Kyle

Hi David,

Thanks for the hints.  My goal is to create a plugin that my collaborators
can load using the Kitware release of the ParaView binaries.  I don't care
if my plugin is installed in the SuperBuild's ParaView.app.

In any case, I tried adding this to my plugin's CMakeLists.txt file:

SET(PARAVIEW_VERSION "${PARAVIEW_VERSION_MAJOR}.${PARAVIEW_VERSION_MINOR}")
SET(PV_INSTALL_BIN_DIR bin)
SET(PV_INSTALL_LIB_DIR lib/paraview-${PARAVIEW_VERSION})

INSTALL(TARGETS vtkLFMReader
  RUNTIME DESTINATION ${PV_INSTALL_BIN_DIR} COMPONENT RuntimeLibraries
  LIBRARY DESTINATION ${PV_INSTALL_LIB_DIR} COMPONENT RuntimeLibraries
  ARCHIVE DESTINATION ${PV_INSTALL_LIB_DIR} COMPONENT Development)


Now `make install` copies my file to /usr/local/paraview-3.12.  However,
otool still shows hard-coded paths (ie. not @executable_path).

I'll look into BundleUtilities to see if I can explicitly call
fixup_bundle_item to set the @executable_path for my plugin.  I suppose the
easiest method might be just to copy my plugin to the ParaView source tree
& let the ParaView `make install` target handle setting all of
fixup_bundle's arguments for me.  That seemed to work with an old version
of ParaView

Thanks,
Pete

Hi,
I have been trying to use the readers that come default in paraview to read
a cdf file...and although pop Ocean netcdf(Rectilinear) reader could read
in the names of the variables it crashes when I hit apply. Nothing else
works either. Could someone please help me? It is poloidal-toroidal field
data that I have in the file.Earlier I had been converting the file into
ASCII and then reading it in, but it would speed up my work a lot if I
could read straight from the cdf file.
Thanks

Could you include the output from "ncdump -h" for your file?  The problem
is that while NetCDF files are supposed to be self-describing, the
information still needs to be interpreted and there are quite a few
conventions so it's not straightforward how to interpret an arbitrary
NetCDF file.  I would think that the NetCDFCF reader (listed as NetCDF
files generic and CF conventions) would be the most likely to work.

I will wait for the 3.14 release, then - I don't have a C++ compiler on my machine.

Thank you,

Betreff: Re: [Paraview] Crash on vtr file load

I've tried and was able to reproduce the crash on WinXP-32bit with ParaView-3.12. I then compiled ParaView from git-master (SHA: 818a8e9) and the file could be opened succesfully. Could you try compiling ParaView from the git? If not, ParaView 3.14 should be released this month and should work.

Cheers,
Kyle

Hi John,

thanks for your answer. Because I'm a newby I'd like to know more about 
the example:

TcpNotificationSocket is a QTcpSocket?

 From the code, it seems that it is used only to send a signal to a slot 
to execute the pipeline update in the paraview gui thread (in fact, the 
socket is closed immediatly).
Is this correct or is the socket used for "real" client/server 
communications?

Is it possible to use something similar for sending the signal from a 
thread using Qt::BlockingQueuedConnection?

Best regards,
Nadir

Subject: [Paraview]  VRPlugin (some feedback)
Message-ID: <000c01cce65e$95498740$bfdc95c0$@tu-cottbus.de>

Hello,

I?ve start to work intensively with the VRPlugin from git-master and want to get some feedback. First of all it works almost great :-). As a tracking system I?m using A.R.TrackPack2 with two infrared cameras and their VRPN server implementation. 

To be able to compile that Plugin some modifications were necessary: 
*  As mentioned in this post (http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2012-February/023816.html) the proxy API undergone some changes. But it seems, that the author of this post mixed up the parameter order.  He referred to proxy name and proxy group. But it has to be swapped...
* Not important to me but required  to compile without errors:  In vtkVRUIPipe.h the flag QTSOCK is checked for existence. I had to put it in manually ("#define QTSOCK 1"). Don't know why.

Further modifications was necessary in the the vtkVRStyleTracking in order to update the HeadPose. The proxygroup name must be changed to "views". The group name "interactorstyles" in the post mentioned above is NOT working, otherwise the plugin crash, since no proxy or property can be found and the pointer are still NULL after configuration.

But so far, I was able to use the VRPlugin in ParaView in a two-side VE and I've got the feeling, that virtual object placed in front of the screens... :-)

Now, I have a kind of problem. When I am moving parallel (left to right) to the screens, I can observe a sort of rotation which can be not described as moving parallax. It seems, that the rotation point lies in the center of my projection displays. Object which came out of screen "standing" not on the same position. They are flying around. So, my question is addressed to experienced Virtual Reality user: Is this described behavior right or not?

Cheers,
Stephan

Ignore this part of my email.  I hadn't realized that 3.12 already has
this exposed as the Gaussian Resampling filter.

It was also pointed out that you can skip the MaskPoints part of the
pipeline and get the same issue.  (Just be sure to set Representation to
Surface.)

Subject: [Paraview] Bug with MaskPoints + GaussianSplatter pipeline/
Message-ID: <4F329015.5060101@cs.unc.edu>

My adviser noticed this bug with a custom VTK class and ParaView plugin
I wrote; I assumed that I was at fault until I was able to reproduce it
with a standard VTK class.

Attached is a .xml plugin for a Gaussian Splatter filter class that uses
VTK's vtkGaussianSplatter class.

To reproduce this bug:
  1) Launch ParaView (I'm using 3.12.0 for Win64).
  2) Tools -> Manage Plugins -> Load New
       -> (load file GaussianSplatter.xml)
  3) Sources -> Wavelet -> Apply
  4) Filters -> Alphabetical -> Mask Points -> Apply
  5) Filters -> Alphabetical -> Gaussian Splatter -> Apply

What I see:  only a small corner of the surface of the Image output of
the filter.  I expect to see a large cube.  I can get the expected
result by saving the output of the Mask Points to a file
mask_points.vtk, loading that file, then running the Gaussian Splatter
filter.  So the bug seems to be in how the two filters interact, not in
either filter alone.

Can anyone else reproduce this bug?  Should I report it to paraview.org/Bug?

Thanks!

Subject: [Paraview] "pseudo" random glyphs
Message-ID: <2A764566-4AD6-4ADF-AADA-63827C3BC173@mcs.anl.gov>

Hi,

Is there a way to generate pseudo-random glyphs on an unstructured grid (or I guess any object for that matter), for time series data? That is, randomly select the points to use, but then use the same points for each time step.  If I understand it correctly, not checking the Random Mode box causes paraview to just select the first N points.  In my case (probably most cases), this concentrates all of the glyphs in one region of the mesh.  Instead, I would like to randomly distribute the glyphs across the mesh, and using the Random Mode for this works fine for a single time step.  But if I want to animate a time series, I would like to show glyphs on the same points for each time time step, rather than have the glyphs jump all over the place.  Is there currently a way of doing this?

Thanks,
joe.

Not sure if the way the seed points move around over time with time
varying data is a bug or a feature.

A work around is to use the glyph with custom source filter.

To make the custom source that you will use for the seed points, glyph
the first time step as you are doing now, but make sure the output
type is points. Save that output as a vtk polydata file.

Next read that file back in and use it as the source input the glyph
with custom source filter.

Strike that, I wasn't thinking clearly.

Generate the seed points dataset as I said before.
Now use that and the TVD as inputs to the probe with Resample with
Dataset filter.
Then glyph that.

Thanks, Dave,

That worked great for the case where I have a vtkUnstructeredGrid of tets, where the coordinates of the mesh does not change over time.

I also have a case where I have a grid of points (particle data), where the coordinates of the points change over time.  In this case I'd like to use the same particle (grid point) IDs for the glyphs for each time step.  Using the Resample with Data filter doesn't work in this case, since the coordinates of the particles are different for each time step.  Do you have any other tricks up your sleeve to resolve for this case?

Thanks a bunch,
joe.

Well, here's one rather odd way of going about it...

Decide on a probability k to keep a point, which is to say, if you have n points, you want k*n glyphs.

In a python programmable filter, create a new variable "mask." For each point, seed a random number generator [1] with the grid point ID of the point, then generate a float f between 0 and 1 (i.e., the random.random() method). If f >= k, set mask to 1 for that point; otherwise, set mask to 0. (This works because the random number generator always produces the same sequence of numbers for the same seed value, so you'll consistently set the mask to the same value for the same point ID.)

After the programmable filter has run, take a threshold of 1 to 1 on the mask variable. Then just use a glyph filter with "mask points" off.

Hello Stefan ! 

I have 2 Cave's on 3 screen and one 4 screens. 

the one with 3 screen is in the form of a half pipe and the one with 4
is from left right botton. 
we are using selfe made application as well as paraview and vmd. 
VMD = Virtual Molekular Dynamics is using CaveLib  
and paraview is using own code. 
Just now Version 3.12 Paraview (former versions 2.8 have been ok vpn
traking was not possible ) 

now we try to use 3.12 with juchee vpn enabled and cave enabled. 
but there are some problems displaying ??? large objects ??? ( 7.5 MB) 

with simple objects i dont have that kind of problems (see
communication mail list) 
maybe ( i dont know its a problem of the graphik card driver)

Hello,

I?ve start to work intensively with the VRPlugin from git-master and
want to get some feedback. First of all it works almost great :-). As a
tracking system I?m using A.R.TrackPack2 with two infrared cameras and
their VRPN server implementation.

To be able to compile that Plugin some modifications were necessary:
*  As mentioned in this post
(http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2012-February/023816.html)
the proxy API undergone some changes. But it seems, that the author of
this post mixed up the parameter order.  He referred to proxy name and
proxy group. But it has to be swapped...
* Not important to me but required  to compile without errors:  In
vtkVRUIPipe.h the flag QTSOCK is checked for existence. I had to put it
in manually ("#define QTSOCK 1"). Don't know why.

Further modifications was necessary in the the vtkVRStyleTracking in
order to update the HeadPose. The proxygroup name must be changed to
"views". The group name "interactorstyles" in the post mentioned above
is NOT working, otherwise the plugin crash, since no proxy or property
can be found and the pointer are still NULL after configuration.

But so far, I was able to use the VRPlugin in ParaView in a two-side VE
and I've got the feeling, that virtual object placed in front of the
screens... :-)

Now, I have a kind of problem. When I am moving parallel (left to
right) to the screens, I can observe a sort of rotation which can be not
described as moving parallax. It seems, that the rotation point lies in
the center of my projection displays. Object which came out of screen
"standing" not on the same position. They are flying around. So, my
question is addressed to experienced Virtual Reality user: Is this
described behavior right or not?

Cheers,
Stephan

Hy Nikhil ! 

Just another information  

found out that glxinfo displays the glxinformation of the local
computer ( forgot i was connect with  ssh -X ) si this is not a problem
version 270 and 290  
290,10  is the right version of the driver)

I suspect there is a path to achieve this through extract selection
with selection by ids as well. Ids are constant across time steps,
which is how we plot particular elements of interest over time. To
populate the selection list with randomly chosen ids you might need to
resort to the python programmable filter swiss army knife.

Thanks for the tips Dave and Sean,

The particle work is not a primary focus for me at the moment, so I may not get around to testing your suggestions right away.  But thanks for making them, they will come in handy when I do get back to that work.

joe.

For each point, seed a random number generator [1] with the grid point ID of the point, then generate a float f between 0 and 1 (i.e., the random.random() method). If f >= k, set mask to 1 for that point; otherwise, set mask to 0. (This works because the random number generator always produces the same sequence of numbers for the same seed value, so you'll consistently set the mask to the same value for the same point ID.)

Hi Christian,

I tried it out on my side and there seems to be a bug in the Volume
Rendering side wrt using setting up the displays for CAVE. Thanks for
identifying this.

You could go ahead and create a bug report at http://paraview.org/Bug by
signing up for an account (if you dont already have one) and assign it to
me. That way you will automatically be notified if this issue is fixed.

Kindly cut and paste all the information you provided me and also attach
the data file along with the bug report. This will help in case somebody
else needs to work on this and needs all the info you provided me.

Regards
Nikhil

The fix for this is available in the latest master. An update should fix
these. Also there is an updated documentation at
http://www.itk.org/Wiki/ParaView/Users_Guide/CAVE_Display

With the new changes VRPN is default for windows and VRUI is default for
mac and linux. However you need to explicitly turn on VRPN
(PARAVIEW_USE_VRPN) if you want to use it on mac/linux.

If any time you want to use the VRUI device daemon make sure you #define
QTSOCK to 0 cause QT sockets are experimental and VRUI uses posix socket
calls (the reason its turned off on Windows). This will soon be changed to
use vtkSocket class which make VRUI cross platform as well.

Sounds good so far.

Now, I have a kind of problem. When I am moving parallel (left to right) to

and the tracker is in meters. That also means that the units for what is
displayed is also meters and is confined to the same coordinates as your
displays and tracking. If the configurations are not right then you
sometimes experience large movement of data as you move your head.

So if the object is between you and the display then when you move left the
object should move on the right side and vice versa (same for up and down).
 If you move too close then the object moves behind your head. So typically
objects are moving around wrt your head in a VE. However it is difficult to
say if it is the right behavior or not unless I can see what is going on.
It will be nice if you can produce some video ;).

If it feels like it rotating around the center of your projection screen
reasonably then it means that stereo is working! if it is too much then
there is a problem of some coordinate transformations.

Let us know if you need some further help.

Subject: [Paraview] ANN: ParaView 3.14, Release Candidate 2 Available
Message-ID: <CADHSJjAs0NaW8qww75We5TKc+9WhFaDR8ePLKdOCK1Y8MYhbAQ@mail.gmail.com>

Folks,

ParaView 3.14.0, Release Candidate #2 is now available for download
(http://paraview.org/paraview/resources/software.html). (You read it
right, Release Candidate #1 had a very short life span of couple of
hours. We nabbed a pesky bug that showed up on Windows just in time.)
These notes give a summary of the major additions to this release. The
detailed change-log can be found at
http://paraview.org/Bug/changelog_page.php.

'Find Data' dialog used to select elements using queries has been
totally redesigned. The new design makes it possible to use complex
queries to select elements including combining multiple test cases
using boolean operations. More information:
http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Users_Guide/Query_Data.

A new 'Memory Inspector' panel was added to make it easier for users
running on large cluster to identify and debug memory related issues
by providing a mechanism to track the memory used on all the nodes.
More information:
http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Users_Guide/Memory_Inspector.

Extending ParaView's charting capabilities, we have added a new
scatter plot matrix view, allowing visualization of multiple
dimensions of your data in one compact form, allowing you to spot
patterns in the small scatter plots, change focus to those plots of
interest and perform basic selection.  More information:
http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Displaying_Data#Plot_Matrix_View.

The color editor used to edit lookup tables/color tables used for
scalar mapping was completely redesigned to enable editing the color
and opacity functions independently. Additionally, one can now specify
smoothly varying opacity functions very easily. More information:
http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Displaying_Data#Color_Transfer_Functions.
 Also, when coloring with an unsigned char array representing RGBA,
it's now possible to render polygonal geometry using the opacity
specified by the alpha component of the scalar array.

To make it easier to deal with a large number of views at the same
time, ParaView now supports creating multiple tabs for placing views.
This enables rapid switching of views laid out on a tile-display by
simply switching the active tab. More information:
http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Displaying_Data#Multiple_Views.

With improvements to the view layout framework, it is now possible to
change the layout of views using Python. More information:
http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Python_Scripting#Updating_View_Layout.

3.14 includes enhancements to the Plugin framework enabling developers
to provide documentation for their plugins. The documentation for the
plugins shows up in the default application help window accessible
from the Tools menu. More information:
http://paraview.org/Wiki/Plugin_HowTo#Adding_Documentation_for_Plugins.

ParaView Server Configuration Script (pvsc) files is the de-facto
mechanism in ParaView to connect to different remote computing sites.
With 3.14, we have added a pvsc distribution mechanism that makes it
easier for site maintainers and ParaView users alike to
distribute/obtain configuration files for different sites. More
information: http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Distributing_Server_Configuration_Files.

Several other usability enhancements were made to this release. For
example, it is now possible to easily copy values such as ranges,
bounds, etc. from the information tab, statics inspector, spreadsheet
view, to the clipboard. To make it easier to find items in variables
lists and trees, one can use Ctrl+F to popup a search widget that
searches through the selected widget. More information:
http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Users_Guide/Introduction#Features.

Also all inspector panels including information tab, display tab and,
properties tab are now dockable.

Netcdf4 has been updated to 4.1.2, making it possible to access hdf5
backed netcdf formats.

This release also includes two new experimental features:
* Collaboration: this adds support to connect multiple clients to the
same server (pvserver) for collaborative visualization.
* Multi-Servers: this adds support to the ParaView client to connect
to multiple remote servers at the same time to build separate
pipelines on the connected servers using the same client.
Note that these are both experimental features and should be
considered as 'alpha'. More information:
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Collaboration.

Subject: [Paraview] Error with EnSight6 reader with "transient single file
 format" and "scalar per element" variable
Message-ID: <CABnFT4WBpEDtgOY+3sg=Sgx-uKKMf2s8AYVYHQGmXoSmeZ3eNw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
When loading an Ensight 6, ASCII with  "transient single file format" and
"scalar per element" variable in paraview I get the error message:
*ERROR: In
/home/kitware/Dashboards/MyTests/ParaView-master/VTK/IO/vtkEnSight6Reader.cxx,
line 1187*
*vtkEnSight6Reader (0x24b5640): invalid element type*
The message is repeated twice when loading a file with 3 time steps.

I have attached a simple example as a tarball. Here are the specs of the
example:
- geometry: 8 nodes, 2 elements (quad4).
- variables:
   - vector per node: displacements.
   - scalar per element: pressure.
- 3 time steps

The tarball has two subdirectories:
- AsciiMultipleFile: the example in a "transient multiple file format"
- AsciiSingleFile: the example in a "transient single file format"

The "transient multiple file format" works. The "transient single file
format" works if only the geometry and the "vector per node" variables
(displacement) are specified, but fails if the "scalar per element"
variables (pressure) are included. The "transient single file format" files
were basically built by concatenating the "transient multiple file format"
files and adding the "BEGIN TIME STEP" and "END TIME STEP" headers between
the time steps.

I am running paraview v. 3.12.0 Linux x86, 64 bit that I downloaded as a
binary, on a Linux CentOS 5.7 (x86_64).

Thanks,
David

Hi Peter,

This is not related to directly to your question but note that Lion does
not really support 10.5 deployment targets.  It only supports Snow Leopard
(10.6) and later.

Subject: [Paraview] VRPlugin (some feedback)
Message-ID: <000901cce7cf$92e799c0$b8b6cd40$@tu-cottbus.de>

Hello,

@Christian: 
I cannot say, that we have problems by displaying data bigger than 7.5 MB. 
Our focus lies on CFD visualization. But when I understand the other threads
right, 
this problem has been identified.

@Nikhil:

In my last post I wrote about the problem of defining the the proxy group
name. I've made
a mistake and addressed the class "vtkVRStyleTracking" for this
modification. This is not
the case. 
The class "vtkVRInteractorStyle" with its method 
"GetProxy( std::string name, vtkSMProxy ** proxy )" required that
modification. And here
I had to "hardcoded" the proxy group name "view" as a first parameter. I
think, the group 
name shall be provided as an additional parameter or attribute in the *.pvsm
file.

Where I can deactivate QTSOCK? There is no option in cmake-gui visible. Or
is this feature
And the future?


@ Aashish:
Ok. So I have to concentrate more on tracking system calibration :-). What
is the best approach
of defining the room coordinate system? I have chosen a symmetric approach.
Our system
consists of two walls with an angle of 112? which means, those two walls
construct a triangle.
The user looks into the corner of the triangle. The origin of my room
coordinate system is
the center of the triangle base. All edge points of the two screens are
defined in respect to
this coordinate system. My question is, is this a good approach? Or should I
place the origin 
directly on of those edge points?


Nevertheless, many thanks for your valuable answers.

Cheers,
Stephan

Hello,

I?ve start to work intensively with the VRPlugin from git-master and want to
get some feedback. First of all it works almost great :-). As a tracking
system I?m using A.R.TrackPack2 with two infrared cameras and their VRPN
server implementation.

To be able to compile that Plugin some modifications were necessary:
*? As mentioned in this post
(http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2012-February/023816.html) the
proxy API undergone some changes. But it seems, that the author of this post
mixed up the parameter order.? He referred to proxy name and proxy group.
But it has to be swapped...
* Not important to me but required? to compile without errors:? In
vtkVRUIPipe.h the flag QTSOCK is checked for existence. I had to put it in
manually ("#define QTSOCK 1"). Don't know why.

Further modifications was necessary in the the vtkVRStyleTracking in order
to update the HeadPose. The proxygroup name must be changed to "views". The
group name "interactorstyles" in the post mentioned above is NOT working,
otherwise the plugin crash, since no proxy or property can be found and the
pointer are still NULL after configuration.

But so far, I was able to use the VRPlugin in ParaView in a two-side VE and
I've got the feeling, that virtual object placed in front of the screens...
:-)

Now, I have a kind of problem. When I am moving parallel (left to right) to
the screens, I can observe a sort of rotation which can be not described as
moving parallax. It seems, that the rotation point lies in the center of my
projection displays. Object which came out of screen "standing" not on the
same position. They are flying around. So, my question is addressed to
experienced Virtual Reality user: Is this described behavior right or not?

Cheers,
Stephan

Hi Kyle,

I have downloaded and tested the new release candidate with the file I sent you. It loads OK, but crashes after a certain action with the clip filter. I get a crash when I do the following:

1. Open the file, read as "Legacy vtk file"
2. Apply
3. Display -> Style -> Surface, Color by -> Value_of_SAR[mW/g]_0s
4. Clip, Properties->Z Normal, Apply
5. rotate around y axis to see the cut plane
6. move the plane with the mouse towards the observer, i.e. in negative z direction
7. Apply => crash

Since this is a release candidate, there are chances that this can be fixed for the release... ;)

Thank you,

Matthias

I've tried and was able to reproduce the crash on WinXP-32bit with ParaView-3.12. I then compiled ParaView from git-master (SHA: 818a8e9) and the file could be opened succesfully. Could you try compiling ParaView from the git? If not, ParaView 3.14 should be released this month and should work.

True.

I am generating our binaries on a snow leopard machine with
CMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET and CMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT both set to 10.5 so
that they will run on leopard, snow leopard or lion.

If anyone knows how to use the 10.5 SDK on lion (just copying a valid
one in place and pointing to it does not work) I'ld like to know.

If it is tracked, it does not matter much, In general people follow
symmetric approach. But I have seen some setups where the origin was placed
at the base corner point(for example at intersection of left and floor
edge)  (mostly I have it seen it in 4 - 6 sided VR). Also I am curious to
know your tracker data units (meters, cm, inch? ).  Can you share a picture
of your system?

@Bill, where is the origin you have set for your 4 wall system?

Matthias,

I'm tempted to believe the clip problem is a memory issue given that
it's a 32 bit XP and the data is "relative large", as you said.

On a Amazon Linux AMI 64bit (Redhat derivative I think) I had to create 
a symlink

/lib64/libbz2.so.1.0 -> /lib64/libbz2.so.1

There seems to be a naming issue between Ubuntu and Redhat

Yes I know that Utkarsh.

I still would like Dr Zenker to reconfirm so that we can reproduce,
isolate and fix the issue.

Please do your comparison runs on 3.12.rc2 and 3.12.0. The change
delta between them is smaller than to 3.14.rc2 which should help to
isolate the specific cause.

I believe I reproduced the crash on my 64 bit XP machine with 8G RAM.
Looking into it right now.

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5378518/how-to-add-base-sdk-for-10-5-in-xcode-4/6293605#6293605

Which you probably have seen BUT I would caution against actually trying that for the simple reason that if Apple isn't shipping the 10.5 SDK with Xcode 4.2 they probably have a really good reason and I would question the stability of software compiled with this work-around.

 And it looks like if you move to 10.7 Lion then you can NOT install Xcode 3.x any more. (There are hacks around that also if you google a bit).

 So it looks like if you want to create 10.5 binaries you MUST still be running OS X 10.6.

Hi Jean,

I looked at the dataset and it looks fine at first glance. It is possible
that this is a bug in the reader. Unfortunately, we don't do any work on
that particular reader because Ensight 6 is a very old format and not in
active use. Is there any way you can try the Ensight Gold format? To see an
example of this sort of thing working, download VTKData from:

http://vtk.org/VTK/resources/software.html

In there, look for blow1_ascii.case and associated files.

Also, this may have something to do with the way the file is written. I
noticed that the displacement are written in a Fortran style with no spaces
between the numbers. I am not sure if our parser (which uses C++) supports
that or not.

So this is an out-of-memory issue after all.

It crashes at this place:

vtkFastGeomQuad* vtkDataSetSurfaceFilter::NewFastGeomQuad(int numPts)
{
...
  // Next: allocate a new array if necessary.
  if (this->FastGeomQuadArrays[this->NextArrayIndex] == NULL)
    {
    this->FastGeomQuadArrays[this->NextArrayIndex]
    = new unsigned char[this->FastGeomQuadArrayLength];
    }
...
}

Basically, the "new unsigned char[]" failed. We or someone else
familiar with this filter could improve its memory usage later, but
for this release, I don't think we will have a fix for it.

Hi David,

I just responded to what seems to be a related question. I wrote the
following:

-------------

Hi Jean,

I looked at the dataset and it looks fine at first glance. It is possible
that this is a bug in the reader. Unfortunately, we don't do any work on
that particular reader because Ensight 6 is a very old format and not in
active use. Is there any way you can try the Ensight Gold format? To see an
example of this sort of thing working, download VTKData from:

http://vtk.org/VTK/resources/software.html

In there, look for blow1_ascii.case and associated files.

Also, this may have something to do with the way the file is written. I
noticed that the displacement are written in a Fortran style with no spaces
between the numbers. I am not sure if our parser (which uses C++) supports
that or not.

Matthias,

On that note, why are you using Clip? Clip on rectilinear grid will
cause a memory bloat. If you're making axis aligned sections, you may
want to use Extract Subset instead.

Thanks. Good to know. I'll track down who's depending on libbz2 and
see if that should be bundled as well to avoid this case.

Hi Utkarsh,

(apologies on resending this, first attempt was blocked because attached 
screen shot exceeded 500kB)

Those sound like wonderful additions especially the new transfer 
function editor, I can't wait to start using 3.14!

I want to share some experience re: the memory inspector as I had 
written something similar as a source plugin called the Process Monitor 
a while back (here's a screen shot 
http://www.hpcvis.com/vis/images/pv/process-monitor.png).

In PV's memory inspector panel it would be useful to organize the server 
ranks by host name and display the total memory used on each host by the 
pvservers. This sum is necessary to know how close you are to actually 
running out.

It may also be useful to display memory usage as both absolute and % 
used. The latter would easily enable adding visual ques to the panel 
(eg. row color is changed to red when more than 75% of memory is used on 
an individual host) to warn the user that they are in danger of a crash.

You may want to consider adding an "override" for reporting the amount 
of free ram (and % used) when the server is run on an SMP such as NICS 
Nautilus. Although Nautilus has 4TB of ram, users need to request a 
specific amount of ram per core when submitting a job. The kernel will 
kill the process that uses more than the requested amount, so what the 
system reports as free memory is fairly useless.

An old version of the Process Monitor is in the SciVisToolKit plugin, 
note that mac server side code is not finished so only windows and linux 
servers are currently are handled. The process monitor has a number of 
additional debugging features such as the ability to attach gdb to 
remote servers, and enable backtrace on sig SEGV etc.

You should also double check that the memory used value you report is 
accurate. When I tested the 3.14 binary I noticed that it reports 4G 
used when top reports only using 425m. There may be a bug in your unit 
conversion?

Hope this feedback is useful, I had intended to share this work but just 
haven't had the time to finish the mac implementation. It's great that 
you have added it!
Burlen

Burlen,

That looks pretty slick! If I had known earlier I would have started
with your code :). Any case, what you have definitely sounds
interesting. We should work on integrating the two in the future.

Great! let me know if there is anything I can do! More recently I had 
revised the panel to make launching remote gdb sessions easier, and 
making it easier to navigate through larger runs (256+ procs).

I just noticed that the memory inspector panel in 3.14 is not reporting 
per-process values which is what I was expecting. So I was wrong, there 
is no bug in the units.  Sorry for the false alarm.

+1 for showing the total memory usage per node/machine.  When I looked at
the one in 3.14 I was thinking that it would be nice to know that
information for all processes sharing the same memory.

Subject: [Paraview] Structured grid point blanking
Message-ID: <CABDpjTmVjco23GAwJ4WTc0QpPy=SG5Mz_5JXM-7rPkxdKvcGvQ@mail.gmail.com>

I am trying to blank a point in a vtkStructuredGrid. Using the below
code, I write out some points to a vts file. All of the points are on
a plane except for one. With or without manually creating a visibility
array, Paraview seems to display all of the points, including the one
that is supposedly blanked.

The goal in both examples below is to ignore the point that is off of
the plane, but in both cases it is displayed anyway. Can anyone
explain this or point out where I'm going wrong?

Without a manual visibility array:

#include <vtkSmartPointer.h>
#include <vtkIdList.h>
#include <vtkProperty.h>
#include <vtkStructuredGrid.h>
#include <vtkXMLStructuredGridWriter.h>
#include <vtkMath.h>

int main(int, char *[])
{
  // Create a grid
  vtkSmartPointer<vtkStructuredGrid> structuredGrid =
    vtkSmartPointer<vtkStructuredGrid>::New();

  vtkSmartPointer<vtkPoints> points =
    vtkSmartPointer<vtkPoints>::New();

  unsigned int gridSize = 8;
  unsigned int counter = 0;
  // Create a 5x5 grid of points
  for(unsigned int j = 0; j < gridSize; j++)
    {
    for(unsigned int i = 0; i < gridSize; i++)
      {
      if(i == 3 && j == 3) // Make one point higher than the rest
        {
        points->InsertNextPoint(i, j, 2);
        std::cout << "The different point is number " << counter << std::endl;
        }
      else
        {
        points->InsertNextPoint(i, j, 0); // Make most of the points
the same height
        }
      counter++;
      }
    }

  bool blanking = structuredGrid->GetPointBlanking();
  std::cout << "blanking: " << blanking << std::endl;

  std::cout << "blanking: " << structuredGrid->GetPointBlanking() << std::endl;

  // Specify the dimensions of the grid
  structuredGrid->SetDimensions(gridSize,gridSize,1);

  structuredGrid->SetPoints(points);

  structuredGrid->BlankPoint(27);
  structuredGrid->Modified();

  // Create a mapper and actor
  vtkSmartPointer<vtkXMLStructuredGridWriter> writer =
    vtkSmartPointer<vtkXMLStructuredGridWriter>::New();
  writer->SetInputConnection(structuredGrid->GetProducerPort());
  writer->SetFileName("test.vts");
  writer->Write();
  return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}

With a manual visibility array:

#include <vtkSmartPointer.h>
#include <vtkUnsignedCharArray.h>

Hi David,

The issue is that the mapper ( i.e., vtkPVGeometryFilter which invokes
vtkDataSetSurfaceFilter ) does not take into account blanking.

I have a patch for vtkDataSetSurfaceFilter that adds such a check. In
vtkDataSetSurfaceFilter::ExecuteFaceQuads you can add the
following if-statement:

void vtkDataSetSurfaceFilter::ExecuteFaceQuads(...)
{

....

 // Old method for creating quads (needed for cell data.).
  for (ic = ext[cA2]; ic < ext[cA2+1]; ++ic)
    {
    for (ib = ext[bA2]; ib < ext[bA2+1]; ++ib)
      {
      outPtId = outStartPtId + (ib-ext[bA2]) + (ic-ext[cA2])*cOutInc;
      inId = inStartCellId + (ib-ext[bA2])*qInc[bAxis] +
(ic-ext[cA2])*qInc[cAxis];

      if( grid->IsCellVisible(inId) ) // This is the If-statement to
check for blanking
        {
        outId = outPolys->InsertNextCell(4);
        outPolys->InsertCellPoint(outPtId);
        outPolys->InsertCellPoint(outPtId+cOutInc);
        outPolys->InsertCellPoint(outPtId+cOutInc+1);
        outPolys->InsertCellPoint(outPtId+1);
        // Copy cell data.
        outCD->CopyData(inCD,inId,outId);
        this->RecordOrigCellId(outId, inId);
        }

      }
    }

...

}

Alternatively, the out-of-the-box approach is to add a flags array to
the point data of the vtkStructuredGrid instance and use vtkThreshold
to display the corresponding subset.

Hope this helps.

Best,
George

The source tarball unpacks lots of directories into the current 
directory rather than "ParaView-3.14.0-RC2".  Can that be fixed please?

Again, I'm getting python stuff installed in the wrong place, e.g.:

    /usr/bin/Python/vtk/__helper.py

This is on Linux, using -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/usr

I think the proper location is:

$(CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR}/paraview/site-packages/paraview/vtk/

You're talking of "make install" in ParaView, right? The full
VTK/ParaView cmake lists are currently being redone and we will be
addressing these issues. For now, I believe you may try editing the
ParaViewSource/CMake/ParaViewCommon.cmake file and the
VTK_INSTALL_PYTHON_USING_CMAKE to OFF. Then you'll use setup.py to
install the python libs. However, I'd take that with a pinch of salt.
The developer who was working on it left the code half baked and I
haven't gotten around to figuring out how far he went or where things
stand. In any case, since other folks are already working on VTK
modularization which was affecting all cmake files, I figured I'll
wait for those changes to happen.

For generating the packages on Linux (32bit/64bit), I used a new
superbuild that I started working
(https://gitorious.org/paraview-collaboration/paraview-binaries-superbuild).
This only handles Linux, but it will evolve to handle all the 3
platforms and cases such as using prebuilt VTK. ParaView 's install
rules will then start following the mantra "install what I build" and
never install any dependencies i.e. no ffmpeg, no qt, etc. Instead,
we'd rely on such super-build projects to build and package
dependencies. A more elaborate discussion is definitely needed, and I
was thinking of starting that on the developers' list once 3.14 is
wrapped up.

I have just tested the exactly same actions with 3.12RC2. It behaves exactly in the same way as 3.14RC2, i.e. crash after the plane is moved towards the observer.
The difference between 3.12RC2 and 3.12.0 (release) was that 3.12.0 crashed immediately when I attempted to load the file...

Is there a chance that this bug will be fixed in 3.14 release?

Thank you,

Matthias

Can you confirm for us that the same operation on the same machine with the same data did work on 3.12RC2?

Hi,

thank you for finding the cause of the crash - at least, now I know why this happened.
I have discovered the "slice" filter which seems not to have this problem. I have just tested it with the file I sent you (29 MB) and with a 200 MB file. No crash so far. So hopefully my problem is solved...

Thanks for the support,

Matthias

Matthias,

On that note, why are you using Clip? Clip on rectilinear grid will cause a memory bloat. If you're making axis aligned sections, you may want to use Extract Subset instead.

Thanks George,

I can't imagine when you would not want to respect blanking? Could you
push that patch to VTK Gerrit?

Subject: [Paraview] calculator gives incorrect results for multiblock
	datasets
Message-ID: <6CDD60864A1CCF49B95D5FF1E63EC79212D9FEA3@UKDEWEB005.uk.rolls-royce.com>

Hi,

 

The calculator gives incorrect results for multiblock unless the
variables have the same index internally.  This can be reproduced with
the steps below:

 

1.       Create a python source that outputs vtkUnstructuredGrid with
the following script:

def add_scalar(ds, val):

                arr = vtk.vtkDoubleArray()

                arr.SetName("Scalar"+str(val))

                arr.SetNumberOfComponents(1)

                arr.SetNumberOfTuples(8)

                for i in range(8):

                                arr.SetTuple1(i, float(val))

                output.GetPointData().AddArray(arr)

 

output = self.GetOutput()

npts = 8

pts = vtk.vtkPoints()

pts.InsertNextPoint(-3.0, -1.0, -1.0)

pts.InsertNextPoint(-1.0, -1.0, -1.0)

pts.InsertNextPoint(-1.0,  1.0, -1.0)

pts.InsertNextPoint(-3.0,  1.0, -1.0)

pts.InsertNextPoint(-3.0, -1.0,  1.0)

pts.InsertNextPoint(-1.0, -1.0,  1.0)

pts.InsertNextPoint(-1.0,  1.0,  1.0)

pts.InsertNextPoint(-3.0,  1.0,  1.0)

output.SetPoints(pts)

output.Allocate(1,1)

ids = vtk.vtkIdList()

output.SetPoints(pts)

output.Allocate(1,1)

ids = vtk.vtkIdList()

for i in range(npts):

    ids.InsertId(i,i) 

add_scalar(output, 2)

add_scalar(output, 1)

This is fixed in the latest code (you may have already noticed). There were
a few API incompatibilities with the latest paraview code and the VR Plugin
which got fixed.

:) ). The future!!! Well it mainly depends on what people would like to see
and who's funding it. But with the current round of funding there are a few
things in the immediate pipeline.

1. Support for side-by-side stereo (for 3dtv's etc in VTK).
2. Adding tests for VR plugin (so be can better identify breakage).
3. Fly-mode interactor style.
4. Hopefully a better way of configuring VR displays and inputs (maybe
implementing a GUI for this). But this is of lower priority for now.

SUMMARY:
If you follow mobile computing (iOS and Android), VTK, VES, and/or ParaView
the following announcement may be of interest to you. The new KiwiViewer
app is now available in both the Android Market and Apple App Store. There
is also a cool feature that enables ParaViewWeb to push geometry to the
KiwiViewer application. This application and supporting libraries are
available in open source form. Read on for details.

ANNOUNCEMENT:

The KiwiViewer applications has arrived in the Android Market and you can
now download it from
https://market.android.com/details?id=com.kitware.KiwiViewer*. *

In this Android release, we've added new features and built-in
visualization demos, so definitely check out this app even if you're
already familiar with KiwiViewer for the
iPhone/iPad<http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/kiwiviewer/id455271681?mt=8>
(we'll
release an app update to bring these new features to iOS owners shortly)
Some of the highlights include:

   - Built-in vis. demos, including a brain atlas viewer, time-series
   animation, and a 3D image slice plane widget;
   - ParaViewWeb connectivity (connect to a running session and receive
   geometry from ParaViewWeb, then view it locally on the mobile device
   without any further network access);
   - Easy access to all many datasets - you can open from DropBox or an SD
   card, or download from a URL, with the ability to load scenes consisting of
   multiple datasets.

For a description of features and supported file formats, visit the
KiwiViewer app documentation
page<http://kiwiviewer.org/kiwiviewer/help/documentation.html>.
If your favorite file format is not supported, please let us know! Contact
us at kiwiviewer at public.kitware.com. As an immediate solution, you can use
ParaView <http://paraview.org/> to convert files for KiwiViewer.

KiwiViewer isn't just for end users. It is an open-source project, powered
by VTK (the Visualization Toolkit) and VES (the VTK OpenGL ES 2.0 Rendering
Engine.) We encourage you to check out the
code<http://vtk.org/Wiki/VES/Developers_Guide> and
use it to develop your own mobile applications. Kitware can help you
develop advanced mobile apps; for inquiries, contact kitware at kitware.com.

Hi,
Is there any reader which directly reads in data(longitude,latitude,radius)
data for a netcdf file? I found some mention of a netcdfCOARDSreader in
some forum but I couldn't find it in the version of paraview(3.10) that I
use. Could someone tell me what I am missing cos I am a beginner at
paraview and netcdf.

Hello Nikhil,

yeah, I see it. I've test the plugin and seems to me it is working. 

Under Windows a small error during compilation occurs in
"vtkVRConnectionManager.cxx". 
When PARAVIEW_USE_VRPN is defined the internal member "QPointer<vtkVRQueue>
Queue;" would not be declared. Moving this line behind that check works for
me.

struct vtkVRConnectionManager::pqInternals
{
#ifdef PARAVIEW_USE_VRPN
  QList<QPointer<vtkVRPNConnection> > VRPNConnections;
#endif
#ifdef PARAVIEW_USE_VRUI
  QList<QPointer<vtkVRUIConnection> > VRUIConnections;
#endif
  QPointer<vtkVRQueue> Queue;
};


Cheers,

Stephan

In my last post I wrote about the problem of defining the the proxy group
name. I've made
a mistake and addressed the class "vtkVRStyleTracking" for this
modification. This is not
the case.
The class "vtkVRInteractorStyle" with its method
"GetProxy( std::string name, vtkSMProxy ** proxy )" required that
modification. And here
I had to "hardcoded" the proxy group name "view" as a first parameter. I
think, the group
name shall be provided as an additional parameter or attribute in the *.pvsm
file.

This is fixed in the latest code (you may have already noticed). There were
a few API incompatibilities with the latest paraview code and the VR Plugin
which got fixed.?
?
Where I can deactivate QTSOCK? There is no option in cmake-gui visible. Or

The QTSOCK will definitely be gone. Its not even an option (just old code :)

@ Aashish:
Ok. So I have to concentrate more on tracking system calibration :-). What
is the best approach
of defining the room coordinate system? I have chosen a symmetric approach.
Our system
consists of two walls with an angle of 112? which means, those two walls
construct a triangle.
The user looks into the corner of the triangle. The origin of my room
coordinate system is
the center of the triangle base. All edge points of the two screens are
defined in respect to
this coordinate system. My question is, is this a good approach? Or should I
place the origin
directly on of those edge points?


Nevertheless, many thanks for your valuable answers.

Cheers,
Stephan

Hello,

I?ve start to work intensively with the VRPlugin from git-master and want to
get some feedback. First of all it works almost great :-). As a tracking
system I?m using A.R.TrackPack2 with two infrared cameras and their VRPN
server implementation.

To be able to compile that Plugin some modifications were necessary:
*? As mentioned in this post
(http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2012-February/023816.html) the
proxy API undergone some changes. But it seems, that the author of this post
mixed up the parameter order.? He referred to proxy name and proxy group.
But it has to be swapped...
* Not important to me but required? to compile without errors:? In
vtkVRUIPipe.h the flag QTSOCK is checked for existence. I had to put it in
manually ("#define QTSOCK 1"). Don't know why.

Further modifications was necessary in the the vtkVRStyleTracking in order
to update the HeadPose. The proxygroup name must be changed to "views". The
group name "interactorstyles" in the post mentioned above is NOT working,
otherwise the plugin crash, since no proxy or property can be found and the
pointer are still NULL after configuration.

But so far, I was able to use the VRPlugin in ParaView in a two-side VE and
I've got the feeling, that virtual object placed in front of the screens...
:-)

Now, I have a kind of problem. When I am moving parallel (left to right) to
the screens, I can observe a sort of rotation which can be not described as
moving parallax. It seems, that the rotation point lies in the center of my
projection displays. Object which came out of screen "standing" not on the
same position. They are flying around. So, my question is addressed to
experienced Virtual Reality user: Is this described behavior right or not?

Message-ID: <000001cceb16$d333b190$799b14b0$@tu-cottbus.de>

Hello,

I have two problems with current git-master ParaView version:

* Stereo in CAVE mode:
Since updating my code base to that version the "Crystal Eyes" stereo mode
is not running. 
When I changed the stereo type to "Red-Blue" only the red channel is
displayed on my walls.

* Empty Scenes
When I construct in the CAVE mode a new scene in PV no objects were
displayed on the 
walls. BUT when I use my old state files (PV 3.12) everything is fine and
displayed as expected. 
It seems to me that in this version something has changed during setting up
a new scene.


Can someone confirm this errors?

Thanks in advanced.
Stephan

Hi Stephan,

Thank you for the feedback. I'm eager to learn more about your experience
on Windows. I must admit that's the least tested platform for our VR
development (due to our client's VR systems primarily being Linux driven).

It will be great to know more about what issues you encounter.

Hello (again),

regarding the cave stereo issue I was able to put an debug message into the 
vtkCamera and noticed that EyeSeparation is an incredibly small value
(1E-332).
 It seems that somewhere the eye separation value is lost which results in
two 
identical projection matrix and this yields a monocular vision. That would 
explain why stereo is not working....

@Nikhil, if I get you right, you are involved in the VR development of PV?

Thanks,
Stephan

Hi Stephan,

There was a slight change in that we can now specify eye separation in the
pvx configuration file. You can set the eye seperation as.

<pvx>
 <Process Type="client" />
  <Process Type="server">
  <EyeSeparation Value="0.065"/>
 <Machine Name="Front"
.....

Hope this helps

Hi Adriano,

It's nice to see such interest. I guess Pat might be able to provide more
details, but in the mean time I'll try to come with some workaround.

So regarding the type of the data that can be loaded, thanks to ParaView
and ParaViewWeb there is no real limitation. You can use a ParaViewWeb as a
front-end to convert on the fly the data that you need to load and ask your
mobile device to render the geometry that has been delivered to it. You can
even ask ParaViewWeb to pre-process the raw data to get only the subset you
are interested in.

In fact the coupling of ParaViewWeb and KiwiViewer brings a wider use case
to the whole framework and that's true for both framework. Both can benefit
from each other. ParaViewWeb extend its usage outside the Web and
KiwiViewer get access to a remote processing framework that can do the
heavy lifting so it could focus on the rendering part.

Hi,

yeah. It does help. But honestly I do have some doubts that this is the best
way to provide eye separation control. Since PVX is
used only at startup this parameter is fixed and all PV scenes running with
that configuration have to use it. In my case I use 
different scenes with different scales (cm or m). I cannot provide one eye
separation for all scenes. And to use one 
configuration file for each scale of scenes feels very cumbersome. In my
opinion the state file is a better place for that 
parameter.

BTW: Is it planned to modify OffCenterProjection computation to consider the
eye angle? 

Best regards,
Stephan

True. We talked about it. I guess we can provide an option to override,
meaning if you have it in state file, it will be used and if not it will
fall back to pvx and finally to default. Does this sounds reasonable?

And to use one

No. Eye Angle is used for a different method for calculating projection.
But I am curious, how would you like to use eye angle?

Completely agree on that one. The same argument also goes for some display
setups too which can change configuration on the fly. I would eventually
like to have all display and input configurations in one central place with
thing configurable and changeable without bringing the system down.

Sebastien already replied but just wanted to add that for VES / Kiwi,
currently we are supporting anything that can be converted to vtkPolyData

I'd like to find the best way to use Paraview when my data is on a remote
THREDDS server. I'm not an expert on paraview or threads so I'd love to
hear from anyone with experience doing this.

I'm interested in visualising climate / weather data that is stored in
netCDF format (conforming to CF conventions) on a THREDDS server. The
THREDDS system in an implementation of DAP and allows the user to download
partial files (just the data you need) using a url-based system. This
avoids the redundant downloading of huge files if only a small amount of
the contents are of interest. Can paraview be used in this way?

I know that paraview can handle netCDF data (and CF conventions). However I
don't know how to access remote netCDF data with DAP / THREDDS. Perhaps
something could be done with python bindings for netCDF or DAP? Perhaps
writing a new plugin is required? Surely someone has done this before me?
Any guidance gratefully accepted!

Sean

Hi Adriano,

KiwiViewer doesn't recognize the vtm file extension, I overlooked that
one.  We'll add it in the next version.  In the meantime, please take a
look here-

And  thanks for your review in the Android market!

Great, hopefully soon. We will update you regarding this.

 My question is not to have direct access on the eye angle but whether
it isconsidered
in the future during off center projection computation.

I see what you are saying. Most of the implementations of stereo would
ignore eye angle. Do you have any technical documentation on this? Also I
cc'd Bill. I will follow up with you in another email (offline). Not sure
if we can get this done in our current funding (most likely not) but at
least we can have a quick discussion.

Hi Berk,
Thanks for your answer. I am pretty sure that there is a bug in the reader.
Specifically in the file vtkEnSight6Reader.cxx. I have modified the source
and now the problem is fixed. I have attached a patch to correct the
problem. Could you include this patch if not in the 3.12 version at least
in the next RC? We have users of our solver who need Ensight6 reader.
Thanks,
David

It wasn't much of a review, really! :-) There is that much useless software
and bloatware on the market, that it is nice to see more proper, functional
software appear.This is just a really nice tool for an engineer to have at
their disposal. I look forward to getting my hands dirty with it in the
coming weeks!

So regarding the type of the data that can be loaded, thanks to ParaView and
ParaViewWeb there is no real limitation. You can use a ParaViewWeb as a
front-end to convert on the fly the data that you need to load and ask your
mobile device to render the geometry that has been delivered to it. You can
even ask ParaViewWeb to pre-process the raw data to get only the subset you
are interested in.

In fact the coupling of ParaViewWeb and KiwiViewer brings a wider use case
to the whole framework and that's true for both framework. Both can benefit
from each other. ParaViewWeb extend its usage outside the Web and KiwiViewer
get access to a remote processing framework that can do the heavy lifting so
it could focus on the rendering part.

SUMMARY:
If you follow mobile computing (iOS and Android), VTK, VES, and/or ParaView
the following announcement may be of interest to you. The new KiwiViewer app
is now available in both the Android Market and Apple App Store. There is
also a cool feature that enables ParaViewWeb to push geometry to the
KiwiViewer application. This application and supporting libraries are
available in open source form. Read on for details.


ANNOUNCEMENT:

The KiwiViewer applications has arrived in the Android Market and you can
now download it from
https://market.android.com/details?id=com.kitware.KiwiViewer. 

In this Android release, we've added new features and built-in visualization
demos, so definitely check out this app even if you're already familiar with
KiwiViewer for the iPhone/iPad
<http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/kiwiviewer/id455271681?mt=8>  (we'll release
an app update to bring these new features to iOS owners shortly) Some of the
highlights include:

*	Built-in vis. demos, including a brain atlas viewer, time-series
animation, and a 3D image slice plane widget; 

*	ParaViewWeb connectivity (connect to a running session and receive
geometry from ParaViewWeb, then view it locally on the mobile device without
any further network access); 

*	Easy access to all many datasets - you can open from DropBox or an
SD card, or download from a URL, with the ability to load scenes consisting
of multiple datasets.

For a description of features and supported file formats, visit the
KiwiViewer app docume

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview 3.14RC2:  selection problem
Message-ID: <F9562F3B302F29479A203FC5AF9E3E0505FAD2@SERBE4I1.intra.erbe-med.de>

Hi,

I have a problem with the new Paraview release candidate (3.14.0-RC2): when I select points in my geometry, they do not appear in the selection inspector, and their point numbers are shown as floats when I set the point labels to "visible". I can do "plot selection over time", however, and in the "Display" tab, the correct point numbers are displayed. But I cannot delete points in the selection inspector because the list does not appear.
Paraview 3.12.0-RC2 does not have this problem.
I have uploaded sample files at  http://www.kitware.com/cgi-bin/uploadfile.cgi (I have put Utkarsh in the "intended for" field) for you to test.
I hope a bugfix will make it into the 3.14 release...

Matthias

Message-ID: <1329251100.81168.YahooMailNeo@web162101.mail.bf1.yahoo.com>

Hello,

I keep getting the following error whenever I try to save an animation in Paraview 3.10.1 on Windows 7 64-bit:

ERROR: In ..\..\..\..\source\VTK\IO\vtkAVIWriter.cxx, line 172
vtkAVIWriter (000000005234ED80): Unable to compress <save location>


I was wondering whether anyone knows how to remedy this issue. I've seen posts that are about a year old on this same topic, but no solutions have been provided that I can use.

Thanks,

Message-ID: <201202151437.23542.archaerolog@mail.ru>

Hi!

I've noticed that clicking on 'eye' (make data visible) also selects data in the pipeline 
but doesn't update tabs (properties, display and info).

Steps to reproduce:
1. open any data
2. clip it for example (in that case original data become invisible)
3. click on 'eye' to make original data visible (this action will also select data in the 
pipeline)
4. see the props, display and info tab -- they still contain data of previous selected data.

P.S. Debian testing amd64, ParaView 3.14 RC2 installed from binaries from the site.

How about left click on eye, toggles visibility and also activates panels, right click just toggle visibility for quick enable/disable

Currently, right click pops up the context menu, but that could be left for the pipeline object itself and the eye handled separately.

just thinking out loud

Hi,
I was having trouble reading data from a netcdf file to paraview. Is there
some syntax that lets paraview know that it is reading in data in spherical
coordinates? I was going through the 'help' section in paraview and found
that 'if spherical coordinates is turned on' the netcdf reader will read in
data in spherical coordinates. Is it something I have to implement as a
part of the syntax in the input cdf file?

Is it possible to hide tab bar? I think that show it only when needed (when more than one 
tab is open) will be a good solution for those who works only with one tab (like me) and 
those who wants more.

screen space is valuable, hiding the tab bar when not needed would be great.

I believe this was done intentionally. It was noted that people often
need to change the "eye" status for some other  filter while editing
parameters for another and then to it ended up being quite annoying
that the "active" source changed when one clicked on the eye ball. I'm
pretty positive this has been  the case since very early 3.* days.

If there's consensus, one way or another, it's an easy fix.

I believe that was default codec issue. It has been fixed. I could not
reproduce it with 3.14.0-RC2 binaries.

Utkarsh,

That would be fine only the problem is that it *looks* like the object is
selected in the pipeline browser and you need to click away and back to the
object in order to actually select it (in order to use the object inspector
or change representation).

Regards,
Paul

Subject: [Paraview] [EXTERNAL]  netcdf reader
In-Reply-To: <CAKbSO=vqeKmub9NX=adiR8bgb8aJR+4YZCsAKnkpY9LkeUnPYA@mail.gmail.com>
Message-ID: <CB614C5F.7924%kmorel@sandia.gov>

This all depends on the structure of your netCDF file.  NetCDF is a general format that stores some set of named multidimensional arrays with attributes.  Generally when you write a netCDF file you need to follow some convention that provides semantic meaning to these arrays.

Given no other information, the default ParaView netCDF reader will assume that the arrays in the netCDF file represent uniform cartesian grids.  In addition, the default ParaView netCDF reader will look for attribute data conforming to the COARDS (http://ferret.wrc.noaa.gov/noaa_coop/coop_cdf_profile.html) or CF (http://cf-pcmdi.llnl.gov/) conventions.  These conventions allow you to specify spherical coordinates in terms of latitude, longitude, and height.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [Paraview] netcdf reader

Hi,
I was having trouble reading data from a netcdf file to paraview. Is there some syntax that lets paraview know that it is reading in data in spherical coordinates? I was going through the 'help' section in paraview and found that 'if spherical coordinates is turned on' the netcdf reader will read in data in spherical coordinates. Is it something I have to implement as a part of the syntax in the input cdf file?
Leo Paul.

Is there a way to determine if a reader works in parallel?  I'm having a reader crash when run in parallel, and I'm not sure which are supposed to handle parallelism and which aren't, and if not, then is it supposed to crash or give an error or...?

You will have to extend ParaView substantially to make it do this
but it could be done.

The architecture I suggest is a new netcdf based reader that connects
directly to the THREDDS server to get its input. ParaView's client and
server may need finessing to fit DAP messaging in with the
existing client/server connection. Lastly the new reader would either need
to use an external netcdf, or vtk's existing netcdf interface would
have to be upgraded to include the DAP portion of netcdf4.

I have a fix for this pushed into git-next. Attached is the patch.
The fix will make it into 3.14.

Subject: [Paraview] Which readers are parallel and which are not?

Other than look in the source code and see how each reader handles
UPDATE_EXTENT/UPDATE_PIECE_NUMBER* no.

The default behavior for a reader which doesn't understand parallelism
is to have every node read the whole file and let the pipeline clip
out and deallocate everything owned by the other nodes just after the
reader.

Readers that do understand parallelism vary in what specific strategy
they use to support it. Most have each node read a different file or
stripe of the same file and get just the local portion of the data. I
gather that some of the newer readers read larger portions on some
nodes and transmit over MPI the subportions that other nodes are
responsible (like the vtkTransmitX filters) for.

This question has been asked twice recently so I'll see about
compiling a list and putting a description of the parallel strategy
that each reader uses into the XML and thus book and help. In the mean
time ask the list about any particular reader and someone will most
likely answer what that reader does.

Subject: [Paraview] Animating Silo Files
Message-ID: <CAOmyp+Q5StWNCymR6Jqo4Lu4VCVoP3yvi=Cp6dyG72Dvuc36kA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I work on a CFD code where we recently created a tool to generate silo
files from our hydro dumps.  I've been trying to animate a sequence of
these silo files but haven't had any success.

If I name the files in a numerical sequence, ParaView loads them as a
group, but I can't seem to get the animation tool to animate through
the sequence of files.

Is this something that's supposed to work but our silo files break
something, or do I need to create an XML filter like the one mentioned
here:
http://paraview.org/Wiki/Animating_legacy_VTK_file_series

Thanks.

Subject: [Paraview] Parallel ParaView - pvserver crash with EnSight file
Message-ID: <4F3C28CB.7090200@llnl.gov>

Hello,

I've been having trouble using parallel paraview to process EnSight 
data, and am hoping someone on this list might help. I've done a lot of 
searching through the archives, and seen similar problems, but have not 
been able to track down how they were solved or what the cause was.

My situation:

I'm running a simulation with Star-CCM+ version 6.06.011, and am 
exporting data in EnSight Gold (.case) format. While the current 
simulations I'm running are small (< 1 mil cells), I will eventually 
scale up, thus I'm looking into post-processing with Paraview in 
parallel. Star-CCM+ successfully exports the .case file and the 
associated variable files. These files are valid and readable by EnSight 
(9.2.2).

In trying to read these files with Paraview, I follow the process:

1) Start pvserver on the remote machine (where my data is) with "mpiexec 
-np 4 pvserver --use-offscreen-rendering" (this is the osmesa version of 
pvserver, by the way)
2) Create an ssh tunnel to the remote machine from my local machine
3) Open Paraview on my local machine, and connect to the pvserver on the 
remote
4) Open the case file

Up until this point, everything runs smoothly. pvserver seems to start 
fine and waits for connection from the client, and Paraview starts up 
fine and connects to the server. Furthermore, when I select the .case 
file to open, Paraview successfully creates a .case object in the 
pipeline browser, and the variables appear in the Cell/Point Array 
Status list in the object inspector.

However, when I hit "apply" on the object inspector to actually import 
the variables, one of two things happens. Either, (1) the pvserver will 
crash (seg fault), or (2) the data appears to be read and an outline of 
my domain/data is displayed.

In case (1), I notice that the statistics inspector actually shows that 
data has been read, but the pvserver has crashed, and I have to close 
down and restart.

In case (2), the statistics inspector shows data has been read, as does 
the information tab in the object inspector. However, if I try to apply 
any other representation other than outline, the pvserver immediately 
crashes again (seg fault).

I originally thought this might be an issue with the EnSight reader, but 
now I'm thinking this may have to do with either the mpi implementation 
or the osmesa implementation.

Any help is greatly appreciated!!

Thanks,

Paul

Message-ID: <CAJxf0dDuFf0dhx2dS1UP5W-8+Cj5Uj3ZOj2-U=UWaQjRj33Mig@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
vtktiff library choose to ignore to export few symbols
like vtk_TIFFSetTagExtender in Windows. This is done by limiting function
names in vtktiff.def file.
This is not the case for Linux compilation where all functions are
available.

Is there a particular reason for not exporting all functions from vtktiff
libraray in Windows.
This creates problem when Somebody tries to use these not exported
functions...

with regards

Subject: [Paraview] Calculator removes cell data
Message-ID: <CB6197CE.C69B%ndfabia@sandia.gov>

Hi,

I just submitted a bug on this: http://paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=12944

But I'm wondering if there's a way to work around it.  The problem is that
I'm trying to modify the coordinates insitu using the displacement, but
that ends up deleting the cell data.  Is there any way to merge the cell
data from one data source into the another?

Something like this:

InputData = InputData() #get the input data from coprocessing

Calculator = Calculator () #removes the cell data

Merged = CopyCellDataFromAtoB (InputData, Calculator) #copies the cell
data from InputData, but uses modified mesh from Calculator

Thanks,
Nathan.

Subject: [Paraview] 3.12.0 Development release via SuperBuild
Message-ID: <CA+1ZiDZ0fD-_5jJ-vXADt+=VKuzJy-th60WrBH9XUWJZTLndXA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I have built a ParaView-3.12.0 development release.  My goal is to use this
development release to compile & link libraries compatible with the Kitware
ParaView releases.  Ultimately, I hope to contribute my development release
for Mac & Linux (x86_64) to the unofficial-dev-install project at
http://code.google.com/p/unofficial-paraview-dev-install/.  However, I am
running into a problem.  Consider the CMakeLists.txt for my plugin:

FIND_PACKAGE(ParaView REQUIRED)
INCLUDE(${PARAVIEW_USE_FILE})
ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN(vtkENLILReader "1.0"
  SERVER_MANAGER_XML vtkENLILReader.xml
  SERVER_MANAGER_SOURCES vtkENLILReader.cxx
  GUI_RESOURCE_FILES vtkENLILGUI.xml)


Target_LINK_LIBRARIES(vtkENLILReader
)


When I configure with my ParaView_DIR set to my 3.12.0 development release,
the code compiles fine, but the link step has problems with four libraries:

i686-apple-darwin10-g++-4.2.1:
/Users/paraview/paraview/ParaView-3.12.0-Darwin-x86_64/lib/libsiloh5.dylib:
No such file or directory
i686-apple-darwin10-g++-4.2.1:
/Users/paraview/paraview/ParaView-3.12.0-Darwin-x86_64/lib/libcgns.a: No
such file or directory
i686-apple-darwin10-g++-4.2.1:
/Users/paraview/paraview/ParaView-3.12.0-Darwin-x86_64/lib/libhdf5.dylib:
No such file or directory
i686-apple-darwin10-g++-4.2.1:
/Users/paraview/paraview/ParaView-3.12.0-Darwin-x86_64/lib/libz.dylib: No
such file or directory


My custom plugin doesn't even use these libraries.  I can manually
link  (excluding the four trouble libraries) and my plugin works with the
Kitware release of ParaView-3.12.0.   For the record, I see similar
behavior when compiling the plugin on Linux with a Linux 3.12.0 development
release.

When I look at CMakeFiles/vtkENLILReader.dir/link.txt, all the libraries
are set correctly except for these four.  I'm not sure what's going on
here... These paths seem to be hard-coded in a few places in my development
release:

lib/paraview-3.12/CMake/ParaViewTargets-debug.cmake
lib/paraview-3.12/ParaViewTargets-debug.cmake
lib/paraview-3.12/KWCommonLibraryDepends.cmake

It seems like all libraries _except_ libsiloh5, libcgns, libhdf5 and libz
are expanded to ${_IMPORT_PREFIX}/lib/paraview-3.12/ in my link.txt.

How do I setup my SuperBuild to properly build a development release which
can be used to compile & link custom plugins without link problems siloh5,
cgns, hdf5 and z?

Thanks,
Pete

Thank you. I get the idea now. But I have one more doubt- is it possible to

have a variable for which I have the spherical harmonic transforms. Can I

Nadir,

sorry I missed this message so didn't reply.

>
TcpNotificationSocket is a QTcpSocket?

 From the code, it seems that it is used only to send a signal to a slot to execute the pipeline update in the paraview gui thread (in fact, the socket is closed immediatly).
Is this correct or is the socket used for "real" client/server communications?
<

you can ignore this, I just snipped a piece of our code, it is actually a message we received from 'somewhere else' to say that new data is ready and it is time for an update.

the important part is

Is it possible to use something similar for sending the signal from a thread using Qt::BlockingQueuedConnection?
<
exactly. If you are going to update the pipeline, you have to do it on the same thread that the paraview gui uses, so from any other thread of your own, you send a message to the main paraview thread and from there you actually call updatepipeline etc.

Subject: [Paraview] Python: opening time-series of files, adding glyphs
Message-ID: <4F3CEFDC.1040903@doxos.eu>

Hello,

I would like to automatize my routine tasks with paraview, but perhaps 
my lack of better understanding of VTK makes 
http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Python_Scripting not as instructive as 
I would like to. Could I get short commands which will do the following?

1. Open a time-series of files with embedded number (File - Open - 
fileName...vtu). The OpenDataFile function does not hadle the ... 
ellipsis. I used the glob.glob module instead, but it does not sort 
numerically; moreover, repeated calls to OpenDataFile do not create new 
time points.

2. Once the pipeline is ready I would like to add Arrow/Spheres/... 
glyphs and make the original white points invisible.

Thanks for help,

Vaclav

Hi Vaclav,

What helps me greatly in writing Python scripts is to use Tools->Start trace in ParaView. Then perform the actions you want, followed by Tools->Stop trace. This will show you which commands were executed in Python code.

Also, if your tasks are always the same, but with different data sets, you can save and load state. Upon loading a statefile in ParaView, it will ask you to specify the readers. This lets you create a state and re-use it with other datasets.

Both approaches have their limits and don't always work 100% in my (also limited) experience.

Good luck!

Please, can someone help me out.

Your only real chance is to attach a debugger to the pvservers and see where it is crashing (and why). Without knowing that, it could be caused by any number of things.
Did the same data work in previous releases?

Hello Utkarsh

The memory inspector is an excellent addition, I just tried it. Thank you

Subject: [Paraview] Python scripting of selection / labels on contours
In-Reply-To: <73B078BEA820DF42BF6A144D69A9B315098D20@MAR160N1.marin.local>

Message-ID: <73B078BEA820DF42BF6A144D69A9B315098EF8@MAR160N1.marin.local>

Dear all,

What I'm trying to achieve is to get labels on contourlines from a python script (that is, non-interactively). To get started, I followed the following advice given on the list on Sep 13, 2010:

"Try doing a slice through all the contour lines, and then selecting the points on the slice that you want to label. Then turn on the selection inspector and show point labels with the variable you want to plot. I've found the number of trailing zeros is a bit annoying, as there's no control over the number format, and I normally choose integer values for the contours. The selection labels aren't persistent so a state file will lose these labels, and you'll have to reselect them if you need another plot."

This works very well in interactive mode when the user makes the selection using the selection tool.

Now, what I want to achieve is to do this from a Python script. I have not been able to reproduce the result if I follow or interpret the output from Python trace when I perform the actions described.

So: if you have any ideas on 1) to achieve selections from python script and/or 2) to create labels on contourlines from python script, I'd be very much obliged.

All the best,


Menno

John,

Thanks for responding. I have not tried any of the previous releases, 
but I'll see what I can do. I'll also try running in a debugger.

In the meantime, on a few of my crashes, I got a stack trace. I've 
included it, below. Any thoughts?

-Paul

Dear Jean Favre,

Thanks a lot, you showed me the way after a long search time!
I am facing a new problem now: when making animations, Paraview uses all 
available memory then crashes (I am using Paraview 3.12.0 64bit). I just can 
make about 400 frames before crashing. After producing the animation, I do not 
know how to "flush" memory, since it remains busy.
Thanks a lot and congratulations for your job.
Best regards,

Message-ID: <CAFYzz24CdoN_hpfdU2hkLzPyr8U-XQRE9X6uxG87-mVc7hMq7w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am trying to get ParaView-3.12.0 working on our visualisation cluster.
However I am getting errors such as the following

"Socket error in call to conect : Connection refused"

As a bit of a background, I have ParaView-3.10.1 working in client-server
mode on the same cluster. On the server, we have IntelMPI-4.0.1 and Slurm
as the scheduler.

I tried debugging the problem by printing stuff out in vtkSocket.cxx file -
I always get the message which says "Connected" from slurm out file.  The
ParaView-3.12.0 client then just hangs.

I did get it to work by using a machinefile (ie outside slurm) and it
worked in client-server to my work station.

I am not really sure what is the cause of this - my suspicion is that this
either to do with IntelMPI-4.0.1 and ParaView-3.12.0 or with Slurm-2.1.4
(which is what is available on the cluster).

Can some one please give me some hints how I can debug this further?


Any pointers are greately appreciated.

Given my level of desperation, I tried with Paraview-3.14.0-RC2 and things
have really changed here - for example, what happend to the PV_CLIENT_HOST
variable? Is this no longer set?
I also note that when you set up a profile to connect to the server in
reverse-connection mode, it no longer allows you to specifiy host name - is
this intentional?

Rakesh

Hi Rakesh,

It sounds as though the compute node cannot see your workstation across 
the network. This is a common situation.

for debugging the issue see if you could follow these steps:
http://paraview.org/Wiki/Reverse_connection_and_port_forwarding#A_Forward_Connection_Over_an_ssh_Tunnel

If that works you probably would like to automate the process using a 
ParaView client side pvsc script to establish a reverse ssh tunnel to 
the cluster's login node, which is presumably visible from the compute 
nodes, and then tell the pv server to connect to this tunnel in a server 
side startup script, which submits a batch job using a batch script. I'm 
attaching an example from NERSC's Cray called franklin, take a look and 
see if it helps.

I know that there were some connection issues with "older" versions of PV 3.14.0.  This problem would be in the source for 3.14.0-RC2.  Give master a try, and see if that helps.  We did find the PV_CLIENT_HOST variable problem - it is fixed in master.

although, I guess that's not really consistent with your 3.10 install 
working... all the same you may find that the attached scripts help. 
Sorry for not reading your post closer the first time.

Alan, Burlen

Thanks for the prompt response - I will try with the master of 3.14.0

Burlen - We don't need to do tunnelling for this cluster (we did for other
clusters), because the compute nodes of viz cluser are visible across the
network (ie I am able to ssh from a compute node on the viz cluster back to
my workstation).

I am now pinning my hope on testing with a different MPI than Intel - Can I
ask what MPI do you use with ParaView?

Rakesh

Can some one please give me some hints how I can debug this further?


Any pointers are greately appreciated.

Given my level of desperation, I tried with Paraview-3.14.0-RC2 and things have really changed here - for example, what happend to the PV_CLIENT_HOST variable? Is this no longer set?
I also note that when you set up a profile to connect to the server in reverse-connection mode, it no longer allows you to specifiy host name - is this intentional?

Regards,
Rakesh

OK, you might want to look at the command line in the qsub script though 
since it doesn't make use of the environment variables. Not sure if 
that's really your issue though.

I've used PV with openmpi, mvapich2, mpich2, cray mpt, and intel mpi. 
Very rarely seen any interactions between pv and various 
implementations. Once or twice hit some weird memory bugs in mvapich.

Hello everyone,

The problem is finally solved. List of steps for adding widget to Cube
Axes Editor Dialog which controls cube axes behavior:

1) Add behavior to vtkCubeAxesRepresentation class and property which
controls it,
2) Add property to
ParaViewCore/ServerImplementation/Resources/views_and_representations.xml
for CubeAxesRepresentation proxy,
3) Add widget to pqCubeAxesEditorDialog.ui and register it with
PropertyManager in pqCubeAxesEditorDialog.cxx.

Thank You all for help!

Best regards,
Nenad.

Message-ID: <DB176578C529FD4FB0BFCF4C5CBE828D257AB011@MWRS1BLADE8.Chester.lan>

Hi all,

I'm requiring some technical support for Paraview, which I hope will be a fantastic tool for realising my research goals.

I'm trying to load a HDF5 file from the Million Song Dataset:

http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/

Presently, I'm testing on a much smaller subset (300mb) of the main 2.8Gb file:

http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/sites/default/files/AdditionalFiles/msd_summary_file.h5

When I attempt to load this .h5 file into Paraview, I am presented with a choice of 'readers'. In short, none of these readers work. They either result in an error, or crash Paraview.

Can you offer any assistance as regards successfully loading the HDF5 file?

Thanks in advance in anticipation of your response.

Marcelo,

Is this using OSMesa for offscreen rendering? There was a memory leak
in 3.10.0 that has been subsequently fixed when saving animations with
OS Mesa and offscreen rendering enabled.

Subject: [Paraview] Set TextureMaptoPlane texture via Python
Message-ID: <4F436F9202000016000655A1@gue-w23s-wiggum.rwdigroup.net>

I've been trying to have a texture (PNG file) applied to a multiblock surface via a Python script. My starting point was a trace of the process,which looks like this
t1 = TextureMaptoPlane()
rep = Show()
rep.Texture = []
 
When I load the PNG file with PNGSeriesReader, and make the command rep.Texture=[pngObject] Paraview crashes with the following error
ERROR: In /home/kitware/Dashboards/MyTests/Paraview-master/ParaViewCo
vtkPVSessionCore (0x1ba6360): Object type: vtkGlyph3DRepresentation, 
or the method was called with incorrect arguments.
 
while processing
Message 0 = Invoke
  Argument 0 = vtk_object_pointer {vtkGlyph3DRepresentation (0x21b2be
  Argument 1 = string_value {SetTexture}
  Argument 2 = vtk_object_pointer {vtkFileSeriesReader (0x22ca5f30)}
 
 
 
ERROR: In /home/kitware/Dashboards/MyTests/Paraview-master/ParaViewCo
vtkPVSessionCore (0x1ba6360): Aborting execution for debugging purposes.
 
Now my representation mode was set to surface so I have no idea why it's referencing vtkGlyph3DRepresentation, and the crash occurs with both multi-block and single block datasets, and in both the Linux and Windows versions of 3.12.
 
I'm hoping someone out there knows the solution to this!

Hi, Utkarsh,

sorry I forgot to replay to the list. I wrote Marcelo yesterday
"Dear Marcelo,

try Edit->Settings->Render View and disable "Use Offscreenrendering for 
Screenshots".
The animation will take more time, but the memory ussage is constant low.
We have the same problem when proccessing a large number of timesteps in 
PV 3.12.

Best wishes,
Christian "

And he said now it's working fine.

But in fact, this does not solve the real problem.
I have a GTX580 GPU with NVIDIA 290.10 64bit propriet?r driver and the 
same memory leak when proccessing a large number of files (>200 by 
fileseriesreader->vtkreader or my own liggghts plugin reader).

Can you please tell me how to check if OSMesa is used or not and how to 
track down where the memory leak comes from (it is not the reader) ?

Thanks,
Christian

Hal,

I confirm this bug in ParaView 3.12 on Mac OS X, Windows 7 64-bit, and
Linux 64-bit.

One of the strange behaviors is that no matter the size of the image
produced by the Gaussian resampling filter, the three subsections of
the surface consist of an 11x11 point grid (as long as the resampling
grid is at least 11x11x11).

Also peculiar is that the Outline representation appears to be working
correctly, i.e, showing the full expected extent of the image produced
by the Gaussian resampling filter. However, the Points, Slice,
Surface, Surface with Edges, Volume, and Wireframe representations
show only the 11x11x11 subset of the image. Interesting, the size of
the image produced by the Gaussian resampling filter is reported
correctly in the Information tab.

I suggest filing a bug report.

- Cory

Following up on this.

I built a debug 32bit version of ParaView 3.14.0-RC2 client on Win7

It hangs on connecting to a remote server (linux 64bit) too.

Here's the backtrace:

Hi Goodwin,

There is a bug in vtkSocket::Receive, where the error condition is not 
tested for in return from recv socket call on *nix systems. It may or 
may not be the source of/related to the issue that you are having but 
it's certainly could cause ParaView to hang silently. Sorry that I 
didn't submit the patch sooner, am way behind on the "new" git work 
flow. I've filed the bug report 
http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=12955, hope it can make it into 
3.14.

Burlen

As far as getting VTK changes into ParaView the easiest way is to follow
the VTK Gerrit workflow (http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK/Git/Develop) and then
just wait for ParaView to absorb those changes when we update ParaView's
VTK branch. This works well for non critical changes as we merge VTK master
into the ParaView's VTK branch every couple of weeks.

Goodwin,

Can you verify that the patch works, please?. It still might be too
late  for 3.14, but it'll be nice to know if it fixes the issue.

Subject: [Paraview] Apparent problems with NVIDIA driver on Linux
Message-ID: <CANmPiKDg1JayB_ZL_krzNcE+Z4KzgdzYJ34zOqGYtFmWDohP5g@mail.gmail.com>

I wanted to post some information to hopefully save others time in
case they are running into rendering oddities while saving an
animation.

Summary

We have seen rendering problems while generating animations from
ParaView 3.12.0 64-bit using the NVIDIA 295.20 driver on both Red Hat
Enterprise Linux Workstation release 6.1 and Scientific Linux release
6.1 (Carbon). Both machines on which we observed the problem have
NVIDIA Quadro 5000 cards. Switching to NVIDIA driver version 275.43 on
both operating systems seems to have resolved our rendering issues.
This driver is hard to find from the main NVIDIA driver web site, but
you can get it here:

http://www.nvidia.com/object/linux-display-amd64-275.43-driver.html

Details

We were trying to generate a simple animation of a time series of
point particles visualized as glyphs. In several of the frames, a
subset of the spheres -- all produced from one glyph filter -- would
appear to switch to the Point representation from the Surface
representation we wanted. This would only happen for a few
non-consecutive frames in a 300 frame animation. They were always the
same frames, so I initially suspected some change in ParaView or VTK
was leading to this behavior.

After compiling and testing an embarrassing number of different
commits in ParaView's git history, I narrowed it down to the
v3.12.0-RC1 tag. The rendering problem didn't appear for any revision
prior to the v3.12.0-RC1 tag, but it was present at the tag and every
commit after it. After looking at the source code, there didn't appear
to be a change to any relevant rendering code in ParaView or VTK, much
less anything that could have caused this problem.

Giving up on the software side, I decided to try a different NVIDIA
driver. I had version 295.20 installed when I observed the rendering
problems. Installing version 275.43 (a more recent driver release, but
lower driver number, for whatever reason) seems to have resolved the
problem for ParaView 3.12.0.

I don't have an explanation for why the ParaView revision seems to
have been involved, other than perhaps the size of the binary somehow
led to the error in the NVIDIA driver.

Here's hoping I save someone some time,
Cory

Message-ID: <9047EE0D4D3C8E43B93980DA10A073805509F787@EXMB04.srn.sandia.gov>

When I run pvbatch, with the following script, pvbatch never exits.  Is there a way to get pvbatch to exit?


# write a file
f = open('/... /working.txt', 'w')
f.write('script worked\n')
f.close()

# exit
exit()

Subject: [Paraview] 3D point cloud with color
Message-ID: <005d01ccf0c8$e95a0ca0$bc0e25e0$@reina@unisalento.it>

Hi,

 

I have been working with 3D stereo reconstruction. So, I have huge 3d point
clouds co-registered with color in this format [X Y Z R G B] (the first
three vector columns specify the location of the single point and the last
three one its color in RGB space). I have been trying to display the data in
Paraview without success.

 

I use the "table to points" filter to show the 3D coordinates but then I do
not know  how to specify the color of each single point using its RGB
components. Can you please help me out?

 

Cheers,

 

Giulio

Suppose I want to plot a cell variable as a function of time. I can see how to do that with the PlotSelectionOverTime filter. But what I really want to do is the same plot for many cells, all at the same time. Is there an easy way to do that? On the Display tab, PlotSelectionOverTime only allows me to select one cell at a time.

Thanks,
Alan

Hi Utkarsh and Burlen,

I applied the patch but it didn't make a difference unfortunately.

A colleague also sees the same problem connecting from a Mac client, btw.

The main thread on the client is stuck here:

     vtkRestartInterruptedSystemCallMacro(
       recv(this->SocketDescriptor, buffer+total, length-total, 0),
       nRecvd);

in the vtkSocket::Receive method.

It looks like the execution is stuck in a worker thread though.

Here's the backtrace for that thread, fwiw:

  	ntdll.dll!7715014d() 	
  	KernelBase.dll!75f80962() 	
  	kernel32.dll!75821a2c() 	
  	user32.dll!7679086a() 	
  	kernel32.dll!7583d3ab() 	
  	kernel32.dll!7583d3ab() 	
  	nvoglv32.dll!69b64477() 	
  	kernel32.dll!758233ca() 	
  	ntdll.dll!77169ed2() 	
  	ntdll.dll!77169ea5()

nvoglv32 is Nvidia's opengl driver...

IN that case, can you check where the server process is stuck? A call
stack for the server would be helpful.

Subject: [Paraview] 3D point cloud with color

Hi Giulio,

After applying Table to Points, you should have a dataset with R, G, and B
data arrays.  You could use the the Python Calculator filter with an
expression:  [R, G, B] to combine the three arrays into a single array, but
ParaView will only color points if the array type is unsigned char, and the
Python Calculator will output double.  Perhaps someone else can offer an
answer to that problem.

But, I have some existing numpy code that does a very similar thing, I have
modified it to fit your file format:

Given test.txt:

1.0 0.0 0.0 255 0.0 0.0
2.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 255 0.0
3.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 255


Apply the Programmable Source with the following python code:


inputFile = 'test.txt'

import numpy

data = numpy.genfromtxt(inputFile, delimiter=' ')
assert(data.shape[1] == 6)

numberOfPoints = data.shape[0]

points = vtk.vtkPoints()
points.SetNumberOfPoints(numberOfPoints)

colors = vtk.vtkUnsignedCharArray()
colors.SetName("RGB255")
colors.SetNumberOfComponents(3)
colors.SetNumberOfTuples(numberOfPoints)

for i in xrange(numberOfPoints):
    points.SetPoint(i, data[i][:3])
    colors.SetTuple(i, data[i][3:])

polyData = vtk.vtkPolyData()
polyData.SetPoints(points)
polyData.GetPointData().AddArray(colors)

mask = vtk.vtkMaskPoints()
mask.SetOnRatio(1)
mask.GenerateVerticesOn()
mask.SingleVertexPerCellOn()
mask.SetInput(polyData)
mask.Update()

self.GetOutput().ShallowCopy(mask.GetOutput())




If your colors are between 0.0 and 1.0, you'll have to edit the line

   colors.SetTuple(i, data[i][3:])

to convert to 0 to 255.

That worked for me for "bin/pvbatch <scriptname>".  I did get 2 debug leak
warnings but no problems exiting.  If I comment out exit(), I don't get the
leaks.

When I ran in parallel I get similar behavior with respect to using
exit().  I do have to use the -sym flag (mpirun -np X bin/pvbatch -sym
<scriptname>) though with pvbatch.  Maybe that's what you're missing.

Hi Giulio,
  I would apply a programmable filter to the data like this for
example ( it also passes through any data not used at the end - if you
have any):
#-----------------------------------
# Copy colour as (r, g, b) into a single unsigned char array.
pdi = self.GetPolyDataInput()
pdo = self.GetPolyDataOutput()
pdo.SetPoints(pdi.GetPoints())
np = pdo.GetNumberOfPoints()
a = vtk.vtkUnsignedCharArray()
a.SetNumberOfComponents(3)
a.SetNumberOfTuples(np)
a.SetName("color")
r = pdi.GetPointData().GetArray("r")
g = pdi.GetPointData().GetArray("g")
b = pdi.GetPointData().GetArray("b")
for i in range(np):
	a.SetValue(i*3, r.GetValue(i))
	a.SetValue(i*3+1, g.GetValue(i))
	a.SetValue(i*3+2, b.GetValue(i))

pdo.GetPointData().AddArray(a)

# Copy through the data we do not use.
pdo.GetPointData().AddArray(pdi.GetPointData().GetArray("px"))
pdo.GetPointData().AddArray(pdi.GetPointData().GetArray("py"))

That's not possible currently. There is a feature request on the bug
tracker I believe, but we havent addressed it yet.

Hi all,

I have issues with running parallel pvserver on linux machine. When I try this `mpirun -np 3 ./pvserver` I get error `vtkServerSocket (0xe09640): Socket error in call to bind. Address already in use.` for every process but first.  I believe it's because each of `pvserver` processes tries to listen the same 11111 port at the same time, but I couldn't find how to specify different ports depending on -np parameter for mpirun. Any help or advice is appreciated.

Thanks.

Message-ID: <34C667B09528AD429E3E2C159F1D3A5E80CE232743@MCHWEXVS4.euce.corp.bshg.com>

Hello,

I'm a newbie in ParaView. I hope you can help me with some basic problems.

I try to postprocess my PIV-data (which I get in csv-format) in ParaView. Therefore I wrote a programme in C which turns the data from the csv-file (x, y, z coordinates (structured), velocity U, V, W and velocity magnitude) in a vtk-format. Next, I load the vtk-file in ParaView to do the postprocessing. Is that how you proceed for postprocessing? Or is it necessary to do some programming in Python for the postprocessing?

After loading the vtk-file I use the gyph-icon both in 3D view (which works well) and in Spreadsheet view. In spreadsheet view there is a column "Points". Which coordinates does this column show as these point-coordinates are not the coordinates of my Grid-nodes.

I hope you can help.

Cheers

Message-ID: <73B078BEA820DF42BF6A144D69A9B3150995B7@MAR160N1.marin.local>

Dear all,

I'd like to add an overlay logo to a render view, containing the institute logo. I have a png file available, but I find no way how to load this into PV, such that it shows in the lower left corner of my view. Any tips?

I expected it to work similarly as Sources->Text where an overlay text can be shown and positioned in the lower left corner, but I found nothing that would work (short of maybe a programmable source?). Am I missing something?

Thanks and best wishes,


Menno Deij

Hi Menno,

in the View setting you can set an image as a background. I know that
is not exactly what you ask for, but that could be a way to do it.

The problem seems to be server side on an aws instance - a remote 
pvserver 3.14.0-RC2 works fine on an Ubuntu desktop.

I haven't got access any longer to the instance but when I do I'll debug 
the server side.

Verify that the paraview is built with mpi enabled (PARAVIEW_USE_MPI
cmake flag must be ON). In most likelihood, it's not.

Hi Menno,

Add a plane via Sources->Plane, position and scale it to your liking, then go to
the Display tab and select your PNG file from "Apply Texture - Load...". You may
want to play with the Opacity and Lighting setting (same tab) afterwards if the
logo is too bright/gray.

Kaster,
Only pvserver process 0 tries to connect through port 11111.  Be sure that you don't have a rogue client process running - this can tie up the port, blocking new clients from connecting.  Check the same thing on the serer side.

Alan

Hi all,

I have issues with running parallel pvserver on linux machine. When I try this `mpirun -np 3 ./pvserver` I get error `vtkServerSocket (0xe09640): Socket error in call to bind. Address already in use.` for every process but first.  I believe it's because each of `pvserver` processes tries to listen the same 11111 port at the same time, but I couldn't find how to specify different ports depending on -np parameter for mpirun. Any help or advice is appreciated.

Thanks.

Subject: [Paraview] copy/pase of clip filter crashes ParaView (tested in
	3.14)
Message-ID: <CAHSaYkr+pg9Sck3XMrxLc=WUDe_p9r=y9KQZh8uDqjP9MVaoFw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

Just to let you know that copying and pasting of a clip filter causes
a crash. I think it will be the same for all filters using a 3D
widget.

I implemented a copy/paste few years ago for ParaViewGeo (based on
ParaView 3.4) and I think that it was able to copy the 3D widgets
correctly. The copy/paste action was a little different: when you copy
a filter, you can paste it on a source and it will create a new filter
on that source with the copied properties.
I find the new way used in ParaView (copying and pasting from/to
existing objects) simpler and better. Here is my old code, in case it
can help fixing the bug.

//----------------------------------------------------------------------------
void pqPipelineBrowser::copyItem()
{
  // The copy item option only supports one filter at a time.
  if(this->getSelectionModel()->selectedIndexes().size() != 1)
    {
			this->proxyCopy = NULL;
			this->proxyCopyType = "none";
			this->portCopy = NULL;
			return;
    }
  QModelIndex current = this->getSelectionModel()->currentIndex();
	vtkSMProxyManager *proxyManager = vtkSMProxyManager::GetProxyManager();

  pqPipelineFilter *filter = dynamic_cast<pqPipelineFilter *>(
      this->Model->getItemFor(current));
  if(filter)
    {
			this->proxyCopyType = "filter";
			this->portCopy = filter->getOutputPort(0);
		}
	else
	{
		pqPipelineSource *source = dynamic_cast<pqPipelineSource*>(
				this->Model->getItemFor(current));

		if(source)
		{
			this->portCopy = source->getOutputPort(0);
			this->proxyCopyType = "source";
		}
		else
		{
			this->portCopy = NULL;
			this->proxyCopyType = "none";
		}
	}
	emit copyFired(this->portCopy);
}

    }

Doesn't anyone else get this problem?

 

I noticed the build shows:

 

Scanning dependencies of target protobuf_code_generation

[ 77%] Generating vtkPVMessage.pb.h, vtkPVMessage.pb.cc

[ 77%] Built target protobuf_code_generation

[ 77%] generating modules

 

But, I cannot find the vtkPVMessage.pb.h file that was supposedly
generated.

 

I'm not sure how to proceed here.  Any help would be appreciated.


Thanks,
Paul

Paul,

vtkPVMessage should have been generated by protobuf. It must have
failed to run or something. Try this, touch
ParaViewCore/ServerImplementation/Resources/vtkPVMessage.proto and
build. You should see something like:

> Generating vtkPVMessage.pb.h, vtkPVMessage.pb.cc
[ 84%] Built target protobuf_code_generation

Check the errors if any.

Paul,

vtkPVMessage should have been generated by protobuf. It must have
failed to run or something. Try this, touch
ParaViewCore/ServerImplementation/Resources/vtkPVMessage.proto and
build. You should see something like:

> Generating vtkPVMessage.pb.h, vtkPVMessage.pb.cc
[ 84%] Built target protobuf_code_generation

Check the errors if any.

I just modified ExecuteProtoC.cmake to print the variable ${OutDir}:

message(STATUS "OUTDIR = " ${OutDir})
execute_process(
  COMMAND "D:/scratch/RollsRoyceParaView/${OutDir}/protoc" "--cpp_out=dllexport_decl=VTK_PROTOBUF_EXPORT:D:/scratch/RollsRoyceParaView/ParaViewCore/ServerImplementation" --proto_path "D:/scratch/RollsRoyceParaViewSource/ParaViewCore/ServerImplementation/Resources" "D:/scratch/RollsRoyceParaViewSource/ParaViewCore/ServerImplementation/Resources/vtkPVMessage.proto"
  WORKING_DIRECTORY "D:/scratch/RollsRoyceParaView/ParaViewCore/ServerImplementation"
)


And, it gives this:

-- OUTDIR = .

When running on the commandline (with the correct path) it generates the files.

Regards,
Paul

Actually, I didn't build anything, because when I tried it took 3 hours and threw some error on 89%, so I just gave up and downloaded ready-to-go version. I believe that's the reason then. Is there any MPI enabled precompiled distro for linux? 

Thanks.

Alan,

I checked that first, so there's no process listening 11111.

Subject: [Paraview] ANN: ParaView 3.14.0 Available for download
Message-ID: <CADHSJjBp5eaNvWBGYk6GFqA27WSgdPo5DkTsbFuoQtYp-or3_A@mail.gmail.com>

Folks,

ParaView 3.14.0 is now available for download
(http://paraview.org/paraview/resources/software.php).

These notes give a summary of the major additions to this release. The
detailed change-log can be found at
http://paraview.org/Bug/changelog_page.php.

'Find Data' dialog used to select elements using queries has been
totally redesigned. The new design makes it possible to use complex
queries to select elements including combining multiple test cases
using boolean operations. More information:
http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Users_Guide/Query_Data.

A new 'Memory Inspector' panel was added to make it easier for users
running on large cluster to identify and debug memory related issues
by providing a mechanism to track the memory used on all the nodes.
More information:
http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Users_Guide/Memory_Inspector.

Extending ParaView's charting capabilities, we have added a new
scatter plot matrix view, allowing visualization of multiple
dimensions of your data in one compact form, allowing you to spot
patterns in the small scatter plots, change focus to those plots of
interest and perform basic selection.  More information:
http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Displaying_Data#Plot_Matrix_View.

The color editor used to edit lookup tables/color tables used for
scalar mapping was completely redesigned to enable editing the color
and opacity functions independently. Additionally, one can now specify
smoothly varying opacity functions very easily. More information:
http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Displaying_Data#Color_Transfer_Functions.
 Also, when coloring with an unsigned char array representing RGBA,
it's now possible to render polygonal geometry using the opacity
specified by the alpha component of the scalar array.

To make it easier to deal with a large number of views at the same
time, ParaView now supports creating multiple tabs for placing views.
This enables rapid switching of views laid out on a tile-display by
simply switching the active tab. More information:
http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Displaying_Data#Multiple_Views.

With improvements to the view layout framework, it is now possible to
change the layout of views using Python. More information:
http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Python_Scripting#Updating_View_Layout.

3.14 includes enhancements to the Plugin framework enabling developers
to provide documentation for their plugins. The documentation for the
plugins shows up in the default application help window accessible
from the Tools menu. More information:
http://paraview.org/Wiki/Plugin_HowTo#Adding_Documentation_for_Plugins.

ParaView Server Configuration Script (pvsc) files is the de-facto
mechanism in ParaView to connect to different remote computing sites.
With 3.14, we have added a pvsc distribution mechanism that makes it
easier for site maintainers and ParaView users alike to
distribute/obtain configuration files for different sites. More
information: http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Distributing_Server_Configuration_Files.

Several other usability enhancements were made to this release. For
example, it is now possible to easily copy values such as ranges,
bounds, etc. from the information tab, statics inspector, spreadsheet
view, to the clipboard. To make it easier to find items in variables
lists and trees, one can use Ctrl+F to popup a search widget that
searches through the selected widget. More information:
http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Users_Guide/Introduction#Features.

Also all inspector panels including information tab, display tab and,
properties tab are now dockable.

Netcdf4 has been updated to 4.1.2, making it possible to access hdf5
backed netcdf formats.

This release also includes two new experimental features:
* Collaboration: this adds support to connect multiple clients to the
same server (pvserver) for collaborative visualization.
* Multi-Servers: this adds support to the ParaView client to connect
to multiple remote servers at the same time to build separate
pipelines on the connected servers using the same client.
Note that these are both experimental features and should be
considered as 'alpha'. More information:
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Collaboration.

however you have to use mpiexec provided by the package.

Ah! I think I know the problem. It might work fine if you use Visual
Studio IDE and not nmake. Can you try the attached patch please?

Subject: [Paraview] Plotting Distances in Zoomed View (Python Scripting)
Message-ID: <CAAcm9KcgqXUgZXxLN9xLodwg=vEe0to39_HpcmQGob-GxVqxrw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am new to paraview python scripting. I wrote a script which can automate
visualization of my .vtu file. Additionally, it can zoom into the view
(which I need). Now, I need to plot the distances in x-axis & y-axis only
for this zoomed part (not the whole domain). For example, if the domain is
from -10 to 10, I need to plot the distances only for the -2 to 2 part. Can
someone please tell me how to go about this (in a python script)?

Thanks & Regards,
Alex

If you're more comfortable in c++ you could use VTK to parse the file,
construct a polydata, and then write a vtp file. Here are the examples
you'd need:

Then Paraview can easily read this vtp file.

Subject: [Paraview]  PV 3.14 Linux crashes when trying to open a file
Message-ID: <4F460B8F.4040908@onera.fr>

Hello, all.

I have just downloaded the new Paraview 3.14 binaries fort Linux 64 bits 
on the Paraview software page.

PV 3.14 can be launched on Linux 64 bits CentOS 5.7, but it crashes when 
I select either the "Open" item or the "Load state" item in the "File" menu!
Has anybody the same problem ? I have not yet tried the Windows version.

Best regards.

Hello.

I just want to add that both 32 bit and 64 bit versions of PV 3.14 crash 
when trying to open a file.
Not yet checked the Windows version.

best regards.

Can't reproduce this on Debian testing amd64... Try launch PV from a terminal 
and look at message after it crash.

Hi Gena.

When I launch PV 3.14 Linux from a terminal, it crashes again when I try 
to open a file but I get this error message:
> Cannot mix incompatible Qt libraries
Is there a Qt library missing in the PV 3.14 binaries and is PV 
searching for an old one installed on my Workstation ?

But I have no problem with the previous Linux version version PV 3.12, 
and selecting in the menu "Help -> About" shows that this is the same Qt 
464 version in PV 3.12 and in PV 3.14.

Best regards.

Here's the backtrace on the remote server:

The server has no GPU and uses OSMesa.

It's stuck in vtkSocket::Receive() too! (so is the client)

Try running paraview as such:

The click FIle | Open and make it crash.

Look at the output generated. It should show you the libraries that it
searched for and loaded. See if you detect any Qt library mismatches.

Looks like you compiled version is 3.14-RC2. Try updating. Not sure if
the issue was resolved since the RC2.

Hi Utkarsh.

I have made the test and I attach the log file.
I can't see in it which Qt libraries are incompatible. I hope this could 
help you solving the problem.

For your information, I am using the same Linux environment for PV 3.12 
and PV 3.14 and PV 3.12 works fine. What has been changed in the Linux 
binaries packages about the Qt libraries ?

I had also tested the Windows 32 version of PV 3.14 : it works fine.

Best regards.

The offending line is:

find library=libQtSvg.so.4 [0]; searching
    ....
      7785:	  trying file=/usr/lib64/qt4/lib64/libQtSvg.so.4

Try the following. If that works, I'll update the binaries:

Remove files  ./lib/paraview-3.14/iconengines/libqsvgicon.so and
./lib/paraview-3.14/imageformats/libqsvg.so and try again.

Subject: [Paraview] Plotting Distances in Zoomed View
Message-ID: <CAAcm9KfTO=NG=iYPMo1MC1f6m0TrAN08uz6NDx2w+C3txe+R5Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am new to paraview python scripting. I wrote a script which can automate
visualization of my .vtu file. Additionally, it can zoom into the view
(which I need). Now, I need to plot the distances in x-axis & y-axis only
for this zoomed part (not the whole domain). For example, if the domain is
from -10 to 10, I need to plot the distances only for the -2 to 2 part. Can
someone please tell me how to go about this (in a python script)?

Thanks & Regards,
Alex

OK, new version didn't help. So I tried to compile from source, again. After spending another 3 hrs I got this error. I thing that's the error I got last time.

---code start---

Building CXX object Qt/Widgets/CMakeFiles/pqWidgets.dir/pqHelpWindow.cxx.o
~/ParaView-3.14.0-Source/Qt/Widgets/pqHelpWindow.cxx(50): catastrophic error: cannot open source file "QWebPage"
  #include <QWebPage>
                     ^

gmake[1]: *** [Qt/Widgets/CMakeFiles/pqWidgets.dir/all] Error 2

---code end ---

How can I get that header file, or whatever <QWebPage> is. 

Thanks.

Your Qt is not built with WebKit. Did you build Qt from source as well?

I'm not sure how exactly I installed it, but most likely using yum.
Is it enough to have all files necessary?

--- code start ---

sudo yum install qt.x86_64 qtwebkit.x86_64 qtwebkit-devel.x86_64
Package 1:qt-4.6.2-20.el6.x86_64 already installed and latest version
Package qtwebkit-2.1.1-1.el6.x86_64 already installed and latest version
Package qtwebkit-devel-2.1.1-1.el6.x86_64 already installed and latest version
Nothing to do

--- code end  ---

I realize in most cases packages in repositories don't have latest versions. Maybe I need to reinstall Qt? from src/rpm?

Thanks for your time, I really appreciate it.D

Hi Goodwin,

Did you also apply the patch on the server side? Again it may not help, 
but without it if there is an error during recv the call would silently 
restart and you'd never know about the error. I had a similar deadlock 
as you do here with version 3.10 on our Cray XE which is how I noticed 
the bug in vtkSocket.

Hi Burlen,

I applied your patch before recompiling.

This problem is only happen on versions >= 3.12 that are on 
headless/gpuless servers.

I'm guessing that it's a problem with offscreen rendering on the server. 
Or it could be a similar subtle bug in vtkSocket... I'll keep looking.

Thanks for your help,

Goodwin

My 2 cents (sorry for butting in without actually reading the full thread) -
I have noticed that states from earlier version of PV are not compatible
with 3.14 for some reason. If you resave the state then it works.

Hello.

I just want to add that both 32 bit and 64 bit versions of PV 3.14 crash
when trying to open a file.
Not yet checked the Windows version.

best regards.

Subject: [Paraview] VirtualGL/TurboVNC and multi-GPU - using only one GPU?
Message-ID: <1F4BA615B73147C5ACFC59DA87E5BAAB@notebook>

Hi,

Is any one out there using ParaView client through VirtualGL and using the
default_server config?

I notice that if I launch the command below from within ParaView I only see
1 or 2 GPU's getting used (looking at load). If I run it outside of ParaView
then both GPU's have load. I am running ParaView client through VirtualGL,
and "glxinfo -display :0" (called from ParaView) sees both GPUs on the node 

mpirun -v -hostfile $PBS_NODEFILE -bynode -np 6
/usr/local/$APPLICATION/$VERSION/bin/pvserver --server-port=11112 -display
:0.1 : -np 6 /usr/local/$APPLICATION/$VERSION/bin/pvserver -display :0.0

This is both a heads up and a question - obviously I see much faster
rendering when both GPUs are used ;)

Cheers,

Paul

Subject: [Paraview] 3D point cloud with color
Message-ID: <CAHDsG9P2YE12oYLNEgxmoRQ1r6S5Pkn+qcDFsxz9aJ4BJ8guoA@mail.gmail.com>

David's suggestion below is very good if you have many large files as
the processing will be really fast.
Using VTK you can easily adopt the following approach:
1) Develop a reader for a single file.
2) Extend it to process multiple files e.g. all files in a directory.
3) Develop a GUI to control the process using QT/QVTK - makes
selecting files easier.
4) Then you can optionally write extra code to control what parts of
the point cloud are selected. The GUI can then be used to control your
selection parameters.

This is really useful if you have point clouds corresponding to some
time span e.g. laser scans of a mine pit, as you can ultimately
animate the data using ParaView.

Hi, sorry that should read  "I only see 1 of 2 GPU's getting used" i.e. I
have 2 GPU's and the second is ignored. Also I tested glxgears running
through VirtualGL and I can point it to either one or the other GPU and that
works. So it seems to be something with pvserver launched from a process
that uses VirtualGL.

Cheers,

Paul

Hi,

Is any one out there using ParaView client through VirtualGL and using the
default_server config?

I notice that if I launch the command below from within ParaView I only see
1 or 2 GPU's getting used (looking at load). If I run it outside of ParaView
then both GPU's have load. I am running ParaView client through VirtualGL,
and "glxinfo -display :0" (called from ParaView) sees both GPUs on the node 

mpirun -v -hostfile $PBS_NODEFILE -bynode -np 6
/usr/local/$APPLICATION/$VERSION/bin/pvserver --server-port=11112 -display
:0.1 : -np 6 /usr/local/$APPLICATION/$VERSION/bin/pvserver -display :0.0

This is both a heads up and a question - obviously I see much faster
rendering when both GPUs are used ;)

Cheers,

Paul

Thank you Utkarsh. Removing these libraries makes PV 314 able to open 
data files or load pvsm states.
Please, let me know when the updated binaries will be available and I 
will make tests.

Hello.

For me, the state files from PV312 are almost compatible with PV 314: 
when opening an earlier version state file, PV 314 just proposes to 
create an additional view that may be canceled and I  recover the full 
saved state. Maybe this is due to the new "Layout" feature ?

Oh my freaking god :)
After 3 hours of building Qt from sources and then 1 hour for Paraview I finally got pvserver to work. My longest linux software installation challenge so far :)

My only concern is each pvserver consumes 100% of CPU when no clients connected and it's idle. Is it normal? Unfortunately that's not what I expected.

Subject: [Paraview] Compiling Plugins for the Binary Release
Message-ID: <4F47797D.1060905@googlemail.com>

Hello,

I am currently trying to compile a rather simple reader plugin so that
it works with the binary release (Linux, 64 Bit, 3.12).

To this end I compiled the paraview sources with the SuperBuild function,
which seams to have worked just fine. But when I compile any plugins
using this build the resulting library is linked against libpng 1.5 from the
SuperBuild folder as well as libpng 1.2 from the system paths.

Since we don't have libpng 1.5 installed globally it would be very nice
if I could prevent the plugin from linking it? Is that possible?

I don't really see how this library can be necessary since the binary
distribution of paraview does not require it either and I certainly don't
do anything with my reader that the standard readers don't do too.

Aside from that is there anyway I can easily influence the search paths
that are compiled into the library? I'd like to set them to the location
of that libraries that ship with the binary distribution instead of my
local SuperBuild.

Best regards
Oliver Behm

Can you post the CMakeCache.txt file you're using for building the
plugin? For linux which super build did you use? The linux binaries
were built using the following repo (checkout tag v3.14.0) :

https://gitorious.org/paraview-collaboration/paraview-binaries-superbuild

To influence the search path, you can use INSTALL_RPATH
(http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/cmake-2-8-docs.html#command:set_target_properties),
however that's still won't help unless you know exactly where your
users are going to install ParaView. Users either have to set
LD_LIBRARY PATH, or simply put all the .so files under
<..>/lib/paraview3.14/ directory.

That shouldn't affect it. I remember ensuring that the layout xmls are
compatible.
Can you share a state file to reproduce this issue? I'd like to have
it addressed.

I have attached the CMakeCache.txt. I am using the SuperBuild
directory of the ParaView 3.12 source release from the ParaView
website, since we are still using version 3.12.

I will try the new version though, if I can make that work that
will probably suffice.

Thanks for the RPATH hint, that is actually quite helpful.

Regards
Oliver

To speed up Qt compilation, compile without example and demos and remember
to use the j switch with the number of cores you want to build with.

I think I know the problem. Qt was built with libpng 1.2 and ParaView
superbuild is building paraview with libpng 1.5 and hence the issue.
You'lll have to build Qt telling it to link against libpng1.5. The new
superbuild I used for ParaView 3.14 takes care of that, but I'm not
sure it'll work out of the box for 3.12. You might be better off just
building Qt with libpng 1.5.

Also try running "readelf -d <soname>" on all shared libraries in your
plugin. That should at the least tell you which "so" is bringing in a
libpng. If none of your "so"s refer to libpng directly, I'd think that
should work just fine.

Utkarsh, the state files that I used cannot be shared because they 
concern confidential data and the datasets are heavy. Is the state file 
alone without dataset useful for you ?
But I could also try to build a small pvsm test file with test data with 
PV 312 and see what happens when reading with PV 314, and I will send it 
on next Monday.

In fact, it's not really important (for me) if PV 314 proposes to create 
an additional view as you can cancel it.

More annoying is another problem that I discovered with one of my PV 312 
pvsm state files with heavy data sets : PV 314 crashed after selecting 
the state file while loading the data!  I don't know if the crash occurs 
when PV 314 is trying to create an additional view. But the state file 
is for a complex pipeline that should produce a 3D view from full CFD 
data with some surface grids and field cuts in surface mode and some 
surface grids in surface LIC mode, and two spreadsheet views that show 
the data in SurfaceFlow objects. I discovered that PV 314 could read a 
modified state file that was saved by PV 312 after having deleted the 
two spreadsheet views, and I could create again these two spreadsheet 
views within PV 314. If the full state file without dataset is useful 
for you I will sent it on next Monday.

Best regards.

Richard,

A state file without data would help too. Let's start there and see if
we can address the issues.

Thanks,

Utkarsh, I could build a simple pvsm state file with PV 312 with only 
source objects : a cone and a sphere.
1. Open this pvsm file with PV 312 : you get the expected 3D view
2. Open this pvsm file with PV 314 : you get the Layout #1 tab split 
with the 3D view on the left side and the "Create View" panel on the 
right side.
I hope the attached pv312satefile.pvsm file will help you.

Best regards.

Thanks Richard, I could reproduce both the issue. I've pushed a fix
for the first and I'll track the second one down as well.

Subject: [Paraview] cmake removing rpath
Message-ID: <CALoNiQf=QmNB1C6-Q7=fLdLqW8=2GBw1Eh1eeDn4zU0i07Wc7A@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I am trying to compile Paraview 3.12 on my x86_64 Fedora 15 workstation.
My main interest is in offscreen rendering so I had to build my own Mesa
libraries (7.5.2) with OSMesa.  The system OSMesa libraries are not set up
properly (or the wrong version) and so if I link to them, pvpython
segfaults when attempting to do offscreen rendering.  If I set my
LD_LIBRARY_PATH to include my 7.5.2 Mesa libraries then offscreen rendering
works fine.  However, I don't want my system as a whole to use my separate
Mesa libraries; only Paraview.  Normally I would accomplish this using the
-rpath option.  However during the "make install" process, cmake strips the
runtime path from the executables.  How do I stop this?

In my Cmake file, I have the flag

//If set, runtime paths are not added when using shared libraries.
CMAKE_SKIP_RPATH:BOOL=NO

but this doesn't seem to do the trick.

Based on this page
http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/cmake-2-8-docs.html#command:set_target_propertiesit
seems there are additional variables I can set

INSTALL_RPATH
INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH
SKIP_BUILD_RPATH
BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH
CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH, CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH,
CMAKE_SKIP_BUILD_RPATH, CMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH, and
CMAKE_INSTALL_NAME_DIR

As it takes a while to recompile each time I try a different combination of
flags, can someone tell me the magic combination of variables which allow
me set (and _keep_) my -rpath?

Thanks,
Peter.

Hi Peter,

I don't know the rpath settings but I have a couple of easy alternatives 
if all you want to do is modify ld lib path for PV without affecting 
other installed apps. What about starting pv with a shell script? eg.

    #!/bin/bash
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/your/osmesa:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    /path/to/your/pvpython $*


the modules package is also very useful for changing paths on the fly.

Subject: [Paraview] Changing array names
Message-ID: <001601ccf384$39bcaa00$ad35fe00$@gmail.com>

I am a very new user of Paraview - and am just learning its capabilities. I
am importing a series of CSV  files - creating points and Delaunay polygons
- and then using the Calculator filter to create vectors to plot with the
Glyph tool.  But when I use the calculator - one of the "Point Data" fields
is not numeric - and when I write my formula (which does not use the
non-numeric field) and hit "Apply"  -  thje Output message says 

ERROR: In ..\..\..\..\source\VTK\Graphics\vtkArrayCalculator.cxx, line 304

vtkPVArrayCalculator (000000000B39EAE0): Invalid array name: 'Name'

(the name of the non numeric field is "name").

I tried renaming this field in the input file - and this didn't work.  So I
removed the non-numeric field completely from the input file - and the
calculator did work.

So, I have the option of editing all of my input files - so they don't have
non-numeric fields - or there is some way of getting Paraview to not choke
on this field - or I'm missing something obvious right in front of my nose?
Any help is appreciated.

Thanks.

Message-ID: <CAHjYNoa+si=FbEZ0gLLow0LNPVHz_8RXrGbY=Rq2DtHnRDPsAg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Sir,

there might be a bug in the Descriptive Statistics filter of Paraview
3.12.0. I get the following error when I apply the filter:

ERROR: In /home/kitware/Dashboards/MyTests/ParaView-master/ParaViewCore/VTKExtensions/vtkSciVizStatistics.cxx,
line 455
vtkPSciVizDescriptiveStats (0x46126c0): No model output dataset or
incorrect type

That error comes up when:
- open disk_out_ref.ex2 from tutorial data, select all variables, apply
- apply Descriptive Statistics filter with default settings (task:
Model and assess same data)

This was tested with both binary ParaView-3.12.0-Linux-x86_64.tar.gz
and a self-compiled version, on Ubuntu 11.04 x86_64.

Binary distributable version of Paraview 3.10.1 seems to work OK (no
errors, and it shows the statistical model properties fine).

Thanks!

BR,
Tuomo

Hi,
producing the grid is not the problem. I want to produce it in such way 
that the data is distributed among process-ranks. For example if i run 
paraview with four processes and we want to have a grid with 8x8, each 
process holds a small piece of the grid(4x4).

Take a look at the writing parallel readers page on the wiki. It explains
what sources and readers need to do to support parallelism.

I think that the example I linked to does work in parallel, each process
produces a different extent of the grid.  Did you have to do something
differently to make it work?

the missing part was only the getting the UPDATE_EXTENT and setting it 
as an extent for the current piece and it works.

Subject: [Paraview] I:  3D point cloud with color
Message-ID: <000101ccf525$67757dd0$36607970$@reina@unisalento.it>

Hi all,

Following  David's suggestion, I came up with the code attached that turns
the starting data file (rgb.txt, of the type [X Y Z R G B] (the first three
vector columns specify the location of the single point and the last three
one its color in RGB space)) into a parsed vtp format. Unfortunately, when I
try to open the VTP file in Paraview (after applying a Glyph filter) the
results are not what I expect, i.e. one point red, one point green, two
points blue.

I would greatly appreciate if someone could help me put reading correctly
the VTP file, I should admit that I'm not very familiar with the use of vtp
files in Paraview,

Cheers

Giulio

If you're more comfortable in c++ you could use VTK to parse the file,
construct a polydata, and then write a vtp file. Here are the examples you'd
need:
http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK/Examples/Cxx/InfoVis/ReadDelimitedFile
http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK/Examples/Cxx/IO/WriteVTP

Then Paraview can easily read this vtp file.

Subject: [Paraview] Getting Python object reference to representation/proxy

Message-ID: <4F4B7B40.3010302@web.de>

Hi,

I'd like to get the reference to representation or proxy (not sure which 
I need) to each object loaded in Paraview via Python.

The big picture: I'd like to rotate each object stepwise about its 
vertical axis, turntable style. I'm trying to produce an animation. 
Orbiting the camera will merely circle all objects which isn't what I want.

Thanks,

I'd do something like this:

view = GetRenderView()

for angle in range(0,360,10):
        for rep in view.Representations:
                rep.Orientation = [angle,0,0] #rotate to your liking
                view.StillRender()
                view.WriteImage('image'+str(angle)+'.png', 'vtkPNGWriter', 1)

Good luck!

Best wishes,
Menno

Thanks Menno. However I'm trying to rotate the objects in the scene and 
not the camera. I've got two objects side by side and I'd like to rotate 
both of them while keeping the camera still.

Thanks.

Ah, OK. I thought that my code below rotates the object. Closer inspection shows that it indeed does not, to my surprise I have to say.

In that case you want to use a Transform filter. Add it after your source and then open the Animation view. In your animation view add the transform rotation, for instance Rotate(0). Animate it from the first to the last value in the desired amount of steps & save the animation.

See the attached example PVSM file (Paraview version 3.10.1), just load & press play.

Thanks Menno. However I'm trying to rotate the objects in the scene and
not the camera. I've got two objects side by side and I'd like to rotate
both of them while keeping the camera still.

Thanks.

Hello,

I'm visualizing structured rectilinear grid and noticed there is some 
inconsistency with shown values. Attached you will see two clips taken 
from one dataset.
I want them to match however they do not. Can I do it somehow?

It looks like your cell data array that you're coloring by is not getting
created correctly.  Can you share the data set?

If this is really your data though and you want to change it then you'll
either have to write your own filter or use the python programmable filter
to make the adjustment.

try to reclone ParaView or at least make sure when you type "git

Hi folks,

Just to update you, I have fixed the problem by using openmpi instead of
IntelMPI-4.0.1.

I am not sure what is the cause of this as IntelMPI-4.0.1 works with
ParaView-3.10.1.  I think if I get time, I will try and compile 3.12 with a
new version of IntelMPI and see if that fixes it.

Cheers,

Andy,

Please find attached my data.
I suspect there might be something wrong with my way of writing VTK 
files. Can you confirm this file is ok or not?
It is desirable to avoid my own filter since I'm not familiar with 
python and ParaView filters.

Hi Andy,

so doing a clean clone with the -recursive flag did not solved the issue ?

What is the system that you are trying to build on ? Are you doing any
cross-compiling ?

Subject: [Paraview] Save animation results in upside down
Message-ID: <CAJ9+f_Gb8atuV+P18hsb1MgjrJe5LoUKBALEcAJnGn=tdCirwQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I just begin to use Paraview to generate animations from a set of .vtk
files. It worked fine for one attempt several weeks ago. But this time, the
saved .avi file shows a animation upside down, compared with what I see in
Paraview window. Everything else seems all right. Does any one know what is
causing this and how to solve? Thank you in advance.

Best,
Xiaopeng

I'm able to load it into paraview.  Whether or not the data is as it
supposed to be, I can't tell since I don't know what you're trying to
represent and how you're hoping to do it.  The grid you sent only has point
data while the image you sent looked like cell data so something is
inconsistent.

The only thing I can think is that maybe your writer is getting confused
with the dimensions.  For VTK structured grids like vtkRectilinearGrid, the
dimensions are the number of points in each direction.

Thanks Andy,

I do have values in the cell centers, but when I change representation 
to the Surface (or Surface with Edges)
and then plot two clips in different dimensions getting what is showed 
on the picture.
I just want my data not to be shifted against each other when plotting 
these clips.

How should then data be written (rectilinear structured grid with values 
assigned to the cell centers) to be properly visualized?

It did solve the problem back then.

However, Paraview 3.10.1 (64bits, built from sources) does not let me
turn the option "Map Scalars" off. The different colors disappear when
using the "Extract cells by region" filter.

Any suggestions? Is that problem solved in a newest release?

Panagiotis

Hi, 

We had a programmable filter that started out like:

from paraview import vtk

input = self.GetInputDataObject(0, 0)
output = self.GetOutputDataObject(0)
ngls = 2

if input.IsA("vtkMultiBlockDataSet"):
    nblk = input.GetNumberOfBlocks()
    print "nblk = ", nblk
    for n in range(nblk):
        blk = input.GetBlock(n)
        if blk is not None:
            i1, i2, j1, j2, k1, k2 = blk.GetExtent()

which worked in 3.12. But trying it with the 3.14 build, the GetExtent() doesn't exist anymore. What do I do to replace it? I can't seem to find the corresponding function.

Poking around, I have another question.

In 3.12 and earlier, the blk type in the script portion I sent out would have been a vtkStructuredGrid object. But now it's a vtkPolyData object. When I look at the information for the data file, the hierarchy says each block is a "Structured (Curvilinear) Grid". 

Why is the data type returned different now from the vtkMultiBlockDataSet.GetBlock() call?

Hi Giulio,
  I am also very interested in viewing XYZRGB data, and I have not had any success in Paraview so far. I think the suggestion to use a vtp file instead of a text file was simply another way to get data in to Paraview. But I think the issue is how to use RGB values for coloring, regardless of how the information is read.

I hope I am wrong, but I don't think this is supported. Paraview (vtk) uses lookup tables to map scalar attribute data to RGB values. It also supports vector data, by using only one of the values, or magnitude, ie still a scalar to RGB mapping. When I load your example vtp file the RGB triplet is loaded as Normals_, and color options are then to use, X or Y or Z or Magnitude.

It seems like this should be easy, really we want to bypass the mapping of scalars to color and have Paraview (vtk) use the provided RGB directly. But I think this might require a completely new Mapper and/or other parts of the rendering subsystem. Probably quite do-able for someone that understands the inner workings of the rendering system?

In the meantime you might be better looking for other tools that are designed to display point clouds with RGB? This kind of data is becoming more common. My interest is for LiDAR data where XYZRGB data is starting to become available, but I have not actually encountered this yet so I have not found a solution.

Here's hoping I'm wrong and someone has a clever solution in Paraview... otherwise perhaps it could be a feature request?

Subject: [Paraview] I: 3D point cloud with color

Hi all,

Following  David's suggestion, I came up with the code attached that turns the starting data file (rgb.txt, of the type [X Y Z R G B] (the first three vector columns specify the location of the single point and the last three one its color in RGB space)) into a parsed vtp format. Unfortunately, when I try to open the VTP file in Paraview (after applying a Glyph filter) the results are not what I expect, i.e. one point red, one point green, two points blue.

I would greatly appreciate if someone could help me put reading correctly the VTP file, I should admit that I'm not very familiar with the use of vtp files in Paraview,

Cheers

Giulio

If you're more comfortable in c++ you could use VTK to parse the file, construct a polydata, and then write a vtp file. Here are the examples you'd
need:
http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK/Examples/Cxx/InfoVis/ReadDelimitedFile
http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK/Examples/Cxx/IO/WriteVTP

Then Paraview can easily read this vtp file.

David

The Map Scalars property on the Display tab controls whether or not
three component unsigned char data is rendered directly as RGB values
or if they are treated as a scalar and run it through the lookup
table.

If your R G and B values are stored in independent arrays, or if they
are not unsigned char, you need to convert them first, then you will
be able to render them directly. You can use the python programmable
filter to convert them.

ParaView does indeed display points with RGB color values.  The colors must
be in a unsigned char array (not any other data type) with 3 components.
Then go to the display tab and uncheck the "map scalars" box, and you will
see the points with color.  You can read more about the map scalars option
in the online documentation here:
http://paraview.org/OnlineHelpCurrent/Display.html

Giulio, did you try the python programmable source that I posted in your
original email?  It works for me on your supplied file, rgb.txt.  If you
use this python programmable source, you can then use File -> Save Data to
re-save the data as a VTP file that can be loaded using a standard reader
in the future.

Pat

And here is an example python programmable filter that you can adapt
to produce a 3 component unsigned char RGB array.

ids = self.GetInput()
ods = self.GetOutput()

ocolors = vtk.vtkUnsignedCharArray()
ocolors.SetName("colors")
ocolors.SetNumberOfComponents(3)
ocolors.SetNumberOfTuples(ids.GetNumberOfPoints())

inArray = ids.GetPointData().GetArray(0)
maxV = inArray.GetRange()[1]
for x in range(0, ids.GetNumberOfPoints()):
  rF = 0.0;
  gF = 0.5;
  bF = inArray.GetValue(x)/maxV
  rC = rF*256
  gC = gF*256
  bC = bF*256
  ocolors.SetTuple3(x, rC,gC,bC)

ods.GetPointData().AddArray(ocolors)

Subject: [Paraview] Grouping a texturable and an untexturable object
Message-ID: <4F4BF40D.2090800@web.de>

Hi -

I've got two objects -- vtp meshes actually. One has texture coordinates 
and the other doesn't. I'd like to group both objects and apply a common 
transform to them. Is there a way to do this in Paraview? I've tried 
placing both objects in a pvd file. Unfortunately, this pvd file cannot 
be textured. Is there a way around this problem?

Thanks,

Hi all,
  Thanks for the excellent info, I had missed the earlier discussion. Using the tiny example txt file from Giulio, TableToPoints, ProgrammableFilter (with the script from Andrew, changed array names from r,g,b to Field 3,Field 4,Field 5), Display tab, uncheck Map Scalars, Color by: color and it works! I'm definitely tucking away this tip for future reference in case I have RGB info in arbitrary fields. But even better: create a vtp file with a 3 component UnsignedChar array and it is good to go!

  thanks again to all, Dave

In-Reply-To: <mailman.5865.1330376013.4107.paraview@paraview.org>
Message-ID: <CB7144C0.E3E%joshua.murphy@lasp.colorado.edu>

Hello,

I am having an issue with restoring the state of a pipeline.  I have a
pipeline that uses the calculator to calculate Density * Radius ^2, and
then displays the values on several different views (I am using a custom
plugin, if that makes a difference). When I restore the state of the
pipeline, everything restores except the values of the calculator.

For example:

To start
	* I create a pipeline that uses Density and Radius from my plugin
	* I add a calculator to calculate Density*Radius^2
	* I display the results on 2 cut planes and 1 3-D contour
	* I save the state

Load from disk
	* I load the state from disk, selecting the same data set
	* When the state finishes loading, the values in Density*Radius^2 are all
Zero.

Work Around
	* If I rename the variable for the calculator, the values are then
calculated
	* I then need to re-apply the new variable to the components

Is there something that needs to be done in my reader to ensure that these
values calculate on restoring state, or is there something wrong the
ParaView itself?

Thanks,
Josh

Sounds like a bug in the calculator filter. Please file a bug report
to help us remember to fix it.

Until someone does fix it, try this Script in a python programmable
filter, placed somewhere before the calculator.

id = self.GetInput()
od = self.GetOutput()
od.ShallowCopy(id)
od.GetPointData().RemoveArray('Name')

You can, but you should also be able to open the file directly with
the csv reader as long as your paraview isn't too old (3.8 or newer if
memory serves).

You are probably looking at the points of the glyphs, which will only
be the same thing as in the input data if your glyph type is 2D Glyph,
Vertex and you aren't subsampling.

There is a problem in your C++ code.
You need to do something like this (these are snippets from my code):
  vtkSmartPointer<vtkUnsignedCharArray> rgb =
vtkSmartPointer<vtkUnsignedCharArray>::New();
  rgb->SetNumberOfComponents(3); // red,green,blue
  rgb->SetName("color");

...
Fill the unsigned array with the rgb values.
...

Then do:
  p->GetPointData()->SetVectors(rgb);

Note the SetVectors(), what you are doing is just inserting normals
through   polydata->GetPointData()->SetNormals(normals);
and these are doubles not unsigned int.

Once this is done load up ParaView and the resulting vtp file. Hit
Apply and you should see the points in colour. Make sure you are using
the most recent version of ParaView.


I can also confirm that the python script I sent you (designed to be
used as a programmable filter) also works Ok.
Load the attached CSV file into ParaView.
Select the TableToPointsFilter and makew dure the X-,Y-,Z- columns
correspond to z,y,x.
Check "Keep All Data Arrays".
Hit Apply
Then select ProgrammableFilter
Make sure the Oputput Data Set Type is the Same as Input
and copy this code into it:
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Copy colour as (r, g, b) into a single unsigned char array.
pdi = self.GetPolyDataInput()
pdo = self.GetPolyDataOutput()
pdo.SetPoints(pdi.GetPoints())
np = pdo.GetNumberOfPoints()
a = vtk.vtkUnsignedCharArray()
a.SetNumberOfComponents(3)
a.SetNumberOfTuples(np)
a.SetName("color")
r = pdi.GetPointData().GetArray("r")
g = pdi.GetPointData().GetArray("g")
b = pdi.GetPointData().GetArray("b")
for i in range(np):
	a.SetValue(i*3, r.GetValue(i))
	a.SetValue(i*3+1, g.GetValue(i))
	a.SetValue(i*3+2, b.GetValue(i))

pdo.GetPointData().AddArray(a)
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hit Apply
In the Display Tab:
Uncheck Map Scalars
Select Color by color
And you should see two blue points and a red and a green point.

I also attach the vtp file I created from your text file. Set the
point size to 11 to make the points more obvious.

Subject: [Paraview] Editing (or omitting) columns in input file
Message-ID: <01ec01ccf5aa$ab1c0f10$01542d30$@gmail.com>

Hello, I posted this question before to this list - but didn't get an
answer.

I am a Paraview newbie.  So bear with me.

I am importing a "csv" file - that has about 15 different fields.  One of
these fields is text - the rest are numeric.

I bring the file in, Use the "Table to Points" filter, and the "Delaunay 2D"
filters with no problem.  Then I try to apply a "Calculator" filter so I can
define a vector field that I can create a glyph for.

When I do this - I get an error message that an array field can't be created
for the text field (the text field is not part of my calculation).  So
somehow this text field is causing the calculator to hiccup.

Is there a way around this?   Is there a way to select all of the fields
except the text field - and then run the calculator on that filtered
dataset?

Any ideas are appreciated.

Ann

Andy,

check this thread out, it may provide some pointer as to what may be
happening: http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2012-January/023668.html

It maybe an issue with ExecuteProtoC.cmake.in

Our emails probably crossed in flight, my recommendations was to file
a bug report and use the python programmable filter to remove the
array.

Hi Tim,

I think you need to get your block as follows:

blk = vtkStructuredGrid.SafeDownCast(  input.GetBlock(n) )

vtkMultiBlockDataSet is a generic container (i.e., not a
block-structured grid). Each block can be any concrete instance of
vtkDataObject.

Best,
George

In the Python shell you can type dir() to see all the available commands at any given time. Importing modules will make more commands available.

Thanks.

BTW, how can I get all the sources in a scene, using Python.

Hi,

I have just downloaded the new 3.14.0 release, and unfortunately the bug is only "half fixed". Selected points appear in the selection inspector with their correct numbers now, but the point labels are still shown in float format, with the same number for all selected points.
I have attached a small file for you to reproduce. Just load it, , hit "Apply", select some points, and set the Point Label to "visible" in the Selection Inspector.
Naively this bug should be easy to fix, as it is not present in 3.12.0-RC2.

Matthias

Message-ID: <4F4C8C2D.7070309@tu-dresden.de>

What is the simplest way to extract all local maxima of a 2D vtu data 
file? Okay, the first and second derivations can be easily computed with 
the Gradient Filter. But what's the simplest way to traverse the data 
and to extract all points that fulfill the corresponding conditions?

Anyone have any ideas on making selections from Python script in ParaView? Or how to put labels with values on contours? 

Thanks and best wishes,

Subject: [Paraview] Python scripting of selection / labels on contours

Dear all,

What I'm trying to achieve is to get labels on contourlines from a python script (that is, non-interactively). To get started, I followed the following advice given on the list on Sep 13, 2010:

"Try doing a slice through all the contour lines, and then selecting the points on the slice that you want to label. Then turn on the selection inspector and show point labels with the variable you want to plot. I've found the number of trailing zeros is a bit annoying, as there's no control over the number format, and I normally choose integer values for the contours. The selection labels aren't persistent so a state file will lose these labels, and you'll have to reselect them if you need another plot."

This works very well in interactive mode when the user makes the selection using the selection tool.

Now, what I want to achieve is to do this from a Python script. I have not been able to reproduce the result if I follow or interpret the output from Python trace when I perform the actions described.

So: if you have any ideas on 1) to achieve selections from python script and/or 2) to create labels on contourlines from python script, I'd be very much obliged.

All the best,


Menno

Hi,

So that worked straight off, nice one thanks for your help. If you need any system specific build info to bug fix this let me know.  However, having built paraview from source to incorporate my readers, which worked perfectly in 3.10, I now get this when trying to use them in 3.14:

ERROR: In ParaView/ParaViewCore/ServerImplementation/vtkSIProxy.cxx, line 307
vtkSISourceProxy (0x17c35640): Failed to create MyReader. Aborting for debugging purposes.

Before I debug this, is this an obvious bug due to interface changes between the two releases?  Any advice?

Cheers,
Andy

Andy,

check this thread out, it may provide some pointer as to what may be

It maybe an issue with ExecuteProtoC.cmake.in

Message-ID: <F9562F3B302F29479A203FC5AF9E3E050606F7@SERBE4I1.intra.erbe-med.de>

Hi,

is there a way to change the time scale in the "plot selection over time" filter? I am doing a transient simulation where the time step is, e.g., 30 seconds, and I would like to display the time in minutes. How do I do that?
The calculator seems not to be able to calculate a new time variable.

Thanks for a hint,

Matthias

Message-ID: <CALm7otq-_nvN2scp-QgMNtxJ02kg3WxxND5AiKDBDVHRu10Bqg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am visualizing a transient flow dataset. I mask points and use a
streamline filter with custom source. This works ideally ... only some
frames reveal broken streamlines. Broken = geometrically correct but
with velocity values order 1e50, or empty (no streamlineas), or
messy/noisy. Now the most annoying part, re-running the filter for the
same settings (just changing a paramter, or timestep, then changing it
back) most of the times result in a proper (expected) behavior.
Is there anything obvious I can check before blaming the filter and
filing a bug report?

Of course, hours after this second message I solved it! So for future reference, this is my approach:

After slicing through the contour lines, label the points as follows:

slice = Slice(Input=myContourLines, SliceType='Plane')
slice.SliceType.Origin=[0,0,0]
slice.SliceType.Normal=[0,0,1]
di = slice.GetDataInformation()
nPoints = di.GetNumberOfPoints()

# vital missing piece of information follows: create a selection source 
selectSource = IDSelectionSource()

# populate it with the IDs of the points to be selected
# this is a list that is [0L,0L,0L,1L,0L,2L,...,0L,nL]
IDs = []
for i range(nPoints):
    IDs.append(0L)
    IDs.append(long(i))

# set the IDs and set the selection input
selectSource.IDs = IDs
slice.SetSelectionInput(0,selectSource,0)

# render the image & modify the label visibility and formatting
rep = Show()
rep.SelectionPointLabelVisibility = 1
rep.SelectionPointFieldDataArrayName = 'Pressure'
rep.SelectionPointLabelFormat = '%3.2f'
rep.SelectionPointSize = 0
rep.SelectionPointLabelColor = [0,0,0]


Kudos to Utkarsh, whose post from 2010 showed the use of a SelectionSource and put me on the right track.

Anyone have any ideas on making selections from Python script in ParaView? Or how to put labels with values on contours? 

Thanks and best wishes,

Subject: [Paraview] Python scripting of selection / labels on contours

Dear all,

What I'm trying to achieve is to get labels on contourlines from a python script (that is, non-interactively). To get started, I followed the following advice given on the list on Sep 13, 2010:

"Try doing a slice through all the contour lines, and then selecting the points on the slice that you want to label. Then turn on the selection inspector and show point labels with the variable you want to plot. I've found the number of trailing zeros is a bit annoying, as there's no control over the number format, and I normally choose integer values for the contours. The selection labels aren't persistent so a state file will lose these labels, and you'll have to reselect them if you need another plot."

This works very well in interactive mode when the user makes the selection using the selection tool.

Now, what I want to achieve is to do this from a Python script. I have not been able to reproduce the result if I follow or interpret the output from Python trace when I perform the actions described.

So: if you have any ideas on 1) to achieve selections from python script and/or 2) to create labels on contourlines from python script, I'd be very much obliged.

All the best,


Menno

Hi Andy,

yes there is a change that may affect you but you might be able to fix
it by updating your CMake and the way you define your plugin.

I can not guarantee the issue that you are facing is what I have in
mind, but if your proxy create a class that was not defined inside
your ParaView plugin but in a library that you build against, then you
need to tell ParaView to add that library in the list of VTK objects
to process so they can be handle with client/server stream. To do so,
we added a new field (CS_KITS) to the plugin declaration. The ParaView
Manta plugin is a good example for that.

Here is the striped off Manta plugin declaration for CMake

add_paraview_plugin(
  MantaView "2.0"
  SERVER_MANAGER_SOURCES   ....cxx
  SERVER_MANAGER_XML             ....xml
  GUI_SOURCES                             .....cxx
  CS_KITS
    vtkManta                          <-- List of external VTK library
that you are using
)

Hope that helps, otherwise you will need to send us your XML proxy definition,

Seb

So my issue then I think is that I used the following method, and have all the files that relate to this approach:

http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/index.php?title=Extending_ParaView_at_Compile_Time&oldid=13197

However, after your post I've now just read this:

http://paraview.org/Wiki/Extending_ParaView_at_Compile_Time

Can you advise, I'm not really sure where to go from here.  I think I'm trying to use a deprecated approach.  I want to still add the code at compile time, but I need to use the new method to do so, is there an update of the first link for the > 3.12 method?  Any other advice would be appreciated.

Cheers,
Andy

To do so, we added a new field (CS_KITS) to the plugin declaration. The ParaView Manta plugin is a good example for that.

Subject: [Paraview] Plotting line over time
Message-ID: <4F4CDDDC.4010705@gfz-potsdam.de>

Hello ParaView team,

Discovering further ParaView I am wondering if the following is possible.

I have time-varying data, a set of vtk volumes. I have no problems to 
animate it over time.
On the same screen I would also like to have a 2D plot showing some 
physical parameter over time.
The point is that I want current time to be somehow depicted on that 
plot. For instance at time t on the
2D plot there will be a line plotted for x=t and y=[0-inf].

Alexander

Use the Plot Selection Over Time filter.

We added the vertical line that moves with the animation to the the 2D
plot in 3.12 I think.

I think using Find Data would be the easiest (Edit->Find Data).  Assuming
Gradients is the name of the field data that you created from your first
Gradient of Unstructured Data Set filter and that you're using Point Data,
set values according to the the attached image.  You probably can't set the
gradient magnitude exactly to 0 as the gradients at the points will
probably not be exactly 0 (that's why I set it to 1).  Then do similar
operations for the second derivatives to get rid of the local minima and
saddle points.  You can then extract that selection if you want to reduce
your data set size.

Alternatively you can use the contour filter for gradients (you'll have to
use the calculator filter to get the magnitude of the gradient) to get
places where the gradient is 0 but not at a point.

I'm not sure it will work but maybe check out the Temporal Shift Scale
filter.

David,

I use 3.12.
I thought Plot Selection Over Time filter should be used when one wants 
to plot selection taken from volume? The data for my 2D plot comes from 
csv file and number of values equals number of volumes in time-varying 
data. Are you sure I should use this filter?

That's what I would use to get an animated 2D plot overtime.

The tricky part will be finagling the values from the csv file into a
selection that can be plotted. For that I'ld probably resort to a
python programmable filter that extracts a different row from the
input table for any given requested time.

I'm not sure it will work but maybe check out the Temporal Shift Scale filter.

Hi,

is there a way to change the time scale in the "plot selection over time" filter? I am doing a transient simulation where the time step is, e.g., 30 seconds, and I would like to display the time in minutes. How do I do that?
The calculator seems not to be able to calculate a new time variable.

Thanks for a hint,

Matthias

Hi Burlen,

Thanks for the help.  The wrapper script solved my problem.  Although, I
would still like to know how to "officially" set the correct paths using
rpath to avoid the proliferation of shell scripts on my machine.

Thanks,
Peter.

You basically have to create a plugin for your code. Looks like you're
creating a reader, take a look at
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Plugin_HowTo#Adding_a_Reader

You'll create a new plugin for your reader and tell ParaView to build
that plugin as one of its own built in plugin, by setting the
EXTRA_EXTERNAL_PLUGIN_DIRS cmake variable.

Now when all is built, you can load the plugin using Plugin Manager
(it will show up automatically) and even make it "auto-load" on
startup.

Hope that helps,
Utkarsh

To do so, we added a new field (CS_KITS) to the plugin declaration. The ParaView Manta plugin is a good example for that.

Subject: [Paraview] dataset crashes PV 3.14.0 when using multi-core
Message-ID: <7F781841FF1E044388AFA42B70703A7A0C4C0F36@CITESMBX1.ad.uillinois.edu>

Hello, I have a dataset that crashes 3.14.0 when I've selected Use Multi-Core, but not when it runs serially. This occurs for both the Linux and Windows 64 bit binaries, and a Linux src build. The crash occurs whenever I try to draw something other than the bounding box.

In linux the error is:

$ bin/paraview
AutoMPI: SUCCESS: command is:
"/home/mvanmoer/builds/ParaView-3.14.0-Linux-64bit/lib/paraview-3.14/mpiexec" "-np" "12" "/home/mvanmoer/builds/ParaView-3.14.0-Linux-64bit/lib/paraview-3.14/pvserver" "--server-port=47235"
AutoMPI: starting process server
-------------- server output --------------
Waiting for client...
AutoMPI: server sucessfully started.
Wrong tag but don't know how to handle it... 41232
Aborted (core dumped)

The windows error is a  Microsoft C++ runtime error, followed by:

ERROR: In ..\..\..\..\src\VTK\Parallel\vtkSocketCommunicator.cxx,line
878
vtkSocketCommunicator(000000000A0AE810): Tag mismatch: got 1,
expecting 41232.


This also occurs for both legacy vtk and XML vtu versions of the data. The 3.14.0 binaries and src build are able to load and display the files in the sample dataset.

The 3.12.0 Linux 64bit and Window 64 bit are able to open and display the trouble dataset.

I'm not sure how to troubleshoot this. Any help is appreciated,
Thanks,
Mark

Well, I tried to run the filter below (entering it into the "Programmable
Filter") - but when I tried to run the calculator on the "filtered" dataset
- it again choked on the text field. (I need to note however that when I
look at the "filtered" dataset in spreadsheet view - the text field is still
there).  
I will go ahead and submit a "Bug" report.  
Any other ideas about how to "filter" out a non-numeric array is
appreciated.

Sounds like a bug in the calculator filter. Please file a bug report to help
us remember to fix it.

Until someone does fix it, try this Script in a python programmable filter,
placed somewhere before the calculator.

id = self.GetInput()
od = self.GetOutput()
od.ShallowCopy(id)
od.GetPointData().RemoveArray('Name')

hdf5 is a meta file format, capable of storing anything at all, so vtk
and paraview need help interpreting what the contents actually mean.
The recommended way to do that is to use xdmf, in which a separate
text file describes the data in the file, and in particular the
entries that are spatial in nature and which scientific visualization
tools handle best.

If the data is spatial in nature, you could then write an xdmf file to
help paraview read it, or you could try John Biddiscombe's hdf5
introspector which creates xdmf files for you.

If the data is not spatial in nature you will need to find a different
reader that produce vtkTables and vtkGraphs instead of vtkDataSets.

Hello Paraview users,

I am trying to build paraviewweb, got

When I try to compile the ParaView adapter,
I get a linker error given below. I am not sure

Hi Paraview Users,

I have visualization problem. When I take a "Threshold" of my 3-D countour

Is there a way to smoothen the view?

Is your data cell-based or point-based? If cell-based, you could try ?Cell data to point data? before contouring. The marching cubes algorithm for contouring works better on point data, in my experience.

Good luck!

Hi Menno,

Thanks for your reply. My data is already point-based. I write my output as
*vtkwriter.addVertexData(rho_i,"rho_i");* so the 'Cell data to point data'
is disabled. Could you suggest an alternative to smoothen the data?

Thanks & Regards,
Alex

Try a Clip by Scalar. Clip filter, with the Clip property set to Scalar. Choose the same variable that you were using for the Threshold filter.

Subject: [Paraview] 3.14.0 - running parallel on a Mac
Message-ID: <CB739C43.9A6B%Richard.C.Angelini.CIV@mail.mil>

I?m using the prebuilt ParaView executable on a Mac workstation ..... And I can?t seem to get the parallel server to start up.   Is there a trick?

In my pvsc file, I have a localMPI configuration that works fine on Linux with 3.14.0 but fails on the Mac.   I have it set up this way:

  <Server name="localhostMPI" resource="cs://localhost:11111">
    <CommandStartup>
      <Options>
        <Option name="NUMPROC" label="Number Of Processes">
          <Range type="int" min="1" max="16" step="1" default="4"/>
        </Option>
      </Options>
      <Command exec="mpirun" timeout="0" delay="5" Arguments="5">
        <Arguments>
          <Argument value="-np"/>
          <Argument value="$NUMPROC$"/>
          <Argument value="/Applications/ParaView-3.14.0.app/Contents/bin/pvserver"/>
          <Argument value="--server-port=11111"/>
        </Arguments>
      </Command>
    </CommandStartup>
  </Server>



When I try to use the localMPI server, I get this error on the Mac:

Hi,

Thanks a lot for your reply. It really works well. Just to ask, is there a
way to set a 'lower threshold' and 'upper threshold'? I mean is it possible
to set a range in the clip filter (by scalar) rather than dividing the
scalar into two halves.

Thanks again for your suggestion.

Regards,
Alex

Hi,

So got there eventually, kind of.  Had to set:

ParaView_DIR

And then it built fine.  However, when I run it, the program dies.  This is fine as the error is that it can't find a symbol, that symbol is in a cpp file that I need to build as part of the plugin.  So how do I do this?  

I've tried adding the files to SERVER_MANAGER_SOURCES, which again compiles but then dies with vtkInstantiatorxdr_strstreamNew().  Basically, how do I tell the cmakelists to compile some cpp files, that do not contain any paraview or vtk specific stuff, but are needed by some of the calls I make inside the plugin which is compiled by the files added to SERVER_MANAGER_SOURCES?

When I had it working in 3.10 I used PARAVIEW_INCLUDE_SOURCES(...) to tell it to build those files and all was good, but using this does not seem to do anything this time round?

Nearly there,
Andy

You'll create a new plugin for your reader and tell ParaView to build that plugin as one of its own built in plugin, by setting the EXTRA_EXTERNAL_PLUGIN_DIRS cmake variable.

Now when all is built, you can load the plugin using Plugin Manager (it will show up automatically) and even make it "auto-load" on startup.

Hope that helps,
Utkarsh

To do so, we added a new field (CS_KITS) to the plugin declaration. The ParaView Manta plugin is a good example for that.

You can just apply two consecutive threshold filters... I shall do the work.

I didn't build the Mac binaries with MPI this time around (3.12's
didn't have it either, because OSX10.7 Lion doesn't come with MPI
anymore).

So unfortunately you have to compile a server from source and enabled
MPI in it for now and connect to that from the pre-built client.

We plan to resolve this in the next release.

Hi,

So got there eventually, kind of.  Had to set:

ParaView_DIR

And then it built fine.  However, when I run it, the program dies.  This is fine as the error is that it can't find a symbol, that symbol is in a cpp file that I need to build as part of the plugin.  So how do I do this?  

I've tried adding the files to SERVER_MANAGER_SOURCES, which again compiles but then dies with vtkInstantiatorxdr_strstreamNew().  Basically, how do I tell the cmakelists to compile some cpp files, that do not contain any paraview or vtk specific stuff, but are needed by some of the calls I make inside the plugin which is compiled by the files added to SERVER_MANAGER_SOURCES?

When I had it working in 3.10 I used PARAVIEW_INCLUDE_SOURCES(...) to tell it to build those files and all was good, but using this does not seem to do anything this time round?

Nearly there,
Andy

You basically have to create a plugin for your code. Looks like you're creating a reader, take a look at http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Plugin_HowTo#Adding_a_Reader

You'll create a new plugin for your reader and tell ParaView to build that plugin as one of its own built in plugin, by setting the EXTRA_EXTERNAL_PLUGIN_DIRS cmake variable.

Now when all is built, you can load the plugin using Plugin Manager (it will show up automatically) and even make it "auto-load" on startup.

Hope that helps,
Utkarsh

You could try the extract surface filter to get it to a polydata and then
the smooth surface filter.  The decimate filter may help out as well if you
tweak the parameters around.

Subject: Re: [Paraview] 3.14.0 - running parallel on a Mac

I didn't build the Mac binaries with MPI this time around (3.12's
didn't have it either, because OSX10.7 Lion doesn't come with MPI
anymore).

So unfortunately you have to compile a server from source and enabled
MPI in it for now and connect to that from the pre-built client.

We plan to resolve this in the next release.

What is the setting of CMAKE_SKIP_RPATH in your super build? Does
changing it make the plugin not try to link to them?

FYI:
The super build builds those four libraries are outside of paraview
proper and links paraview to them as USE_EXTERNALs. When your plugin
links to some part of paraview it thinks it needs these because
paraview does.

I ran into a similar thing when making 3.14's vistrails plugin on mac.
In my case I manually edited the path for hdf5 using install_name_tool
to make it correct and relative to the executable's location in the
bundle.

Subject: [Paraview] 3.14 pvsc enumeration issues
Message-ID: <4F4E674B.3000305@lbl.gov>

Hi,

I've encountered bugs with pvsc enumerations in version 3.14.0. I have 
the attached pvsc that makes use of a couple of enumerations. After 
connecting once w/ this pvsc, neither of the enums save the user's 
choice in the GUI the next time the server is used. However they seem to 
remember the user's last choice internally and always uses that instead 
of what the user has selected in the GUI. Neither setting save=false or 
removing the default attribute helps. I filed the bug report here. 
http://paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=12969 If it's confirmed would the 
bug be fixed in another 3.14 release? or should I simply remove 
enumerations from our pvsc's for 3.14?

Burlen

What platform is the client running on?   We make extensive use of pvsc and enumerations and have not seen this  (mis)behavior on our Mac/Linux client workstations......

Hi Rick,

Good, maybe it's something specific to my configuration although I don't 
have any idea what it could be off hand. Just to be sure: do you mean 
that you haven't had noticed problems or that you've positively verified 
that after using the enum once you could change the value?

thanks
Burlen

Burlen - I've been testing with 3.12, not 3.14 ... did things work for you in 3.12 and they are now broken in 3.14?

Hi Rick,

yes things are fine in 3.12 it's only with 3.14 that I'm having this issue.

Burlen,

I haven't tried reproducing the problem, but looking at the code, it's
pretty obvious why it could fail. I'll work on a fix soon. I think
this and few other state file backwards compatibility related issues
that been reported may warrant a quick patch release. But I'll check
with the team once I get back next week and give everyone an update.

Burlen,

Attached is a patch. Can you please verify if that solves the issue?
Seems to working now in my tests.

Thanks
