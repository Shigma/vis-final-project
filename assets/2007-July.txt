Hi Mike,

I've put some compilation instructions for paraview 3 (3.0.2) on MacOSX 
activating MPI at [1]. It builds cleanly with the same versions as you 
describe (except that I'm on OS X 10.4.10). It also builds 
paraview.app fine.
But maybe I don't activate some CMake options that you do need and that 
makes the difference? 
I haven't tried without MPI, but I can't see a reason why it would be 
more difficult to compile *without* MPI support.

Regards,
Marc

Marc. thanks for the links. I am basically doing the same thing except
that I am using Qt 4.3.0. I will try PV 3.02 again against Qt 4.3.0
(as dylibs) again to see if it will work.

I wonder if the Qt version is messing things up? You used Qt 4.2.3
with what seems like no problems. I used Qt 4.3.0 with problems.

I did a clcean checkout of PV 302 and recompiled against Qt 4.3.0
(built as DyLibs, but NO Debug Libraries), set the Build type to Debug
(am I Shooting myself in the foot at this point?) and built.

I get a bin/paraview-real.app but only a bin/paraview which will
actually run which is at least partially good, but where is my
paraview.app going?

Thanks

I take that back. bin/paraview will NOT run.. so I am left with a  
dead build. The error I get is:

[mjackson@Thor:pv302]$ bin/paraview
Error running "/Users/Shared/OpenSource/pv302/bin/paraview-real": No  
such file or directory

But there is a paraview-real.app in the bin folder.

If I switch to the Paraview-3-0 branch, apply my fixes to the  
CMakeLists.txt files then I can at least get a build that does run  
although I have to run it from the command line as only a bin/ 
paraview executable it built, and not a bin/paraview.app.

I guess this boils down to: If ParaView-3-0-2 is billed as a release,  
how are others building it?

I am going to punt back to Qt 4.2.3 and see what happens

Ah, yes, I hadn't noticed that the QT versions differed. I don't 
remember why I used 4.2.3 and not 4.3.0.

Where does the *-real come from? I don't get such a thing. Just a plain 
paraview.app! And I don't get a bin/paraview executable at all.
As I said, the paraview.app builds fine.

If that is any help to you, I could certainly tar my src or build 
directories and send them to you..

Good luck,
  Marc

Looking through vtkEnSightGoldReader.cxx I can't see that anything spezial
is being done for undefined values, other than reading and skipping over the
extra line. The UndefPartialInternal class is defined, but its use is
appears restricted to addressing 'partial' values.

You'll have to ask a VTK expert about how or if undef values can be
propagated back to VTK.

I'll keep waiting (and hoping) for an answer about polyhedral support.

Subject: [Paraview] Compile Paraview with Python-Wrappings for VTK(!) enabled
Message-ID: <87bqev3s98.fsf@workstation001.office.ice-sf.at>


Hi!

I want to play around with the VTK and Python. As I have already a
Source-installation of Paraview3 I figured I'd better use the VTK that
comes with this. The switch  VTK_WRAP_PYTHON is not available in
ccmake, so I changed it in CMakeCache.txt to ON. Now the option is
visible, but when I try to configure/generate/compile it gets reset to
OFF.

Is there any other way to enable the Python-Wrapping or do I have to
install a separate version of the VTK?

Bernhard

PS: Googling around found some indications that VTK_WRAP_TCL has to be
enabled as well, but this didn't work for me, too.

It seems the "problem" is in the "VTK_USE_RPATH" setting. If I set  
this to OFF (which is the default) then I end up with a broken build  
and the "paraview-real.app". If I set this to "ON" then I end up with  
a good build and a paraview.app that actually runs. I guess the  
CMakeLists.txt files still need some work. This was built against Qt  
4.3.0 as Dylibs. I am going to try again with Qt 4.3.0 as Frameworks.

Hi,

I have a working PV script with Surface representation, but if I try to

Below is the script list that works because it has commented the

Does anybody know what should be done in order to active the Volume

Try this:

Setup these three directories:
* PV3SOURCEDIR (the directory where you have you ParaView3 source)
* PV3BUILDDIR (the directory where you've built ParaView3)
   start this build by issuing
   >ccmake ${PV3SOURCEDIR}
* VTKBUILDDIR (the directory where you want to build VTK)
   start this build by issuing
   >ccmake ${PV3SOURCEDIR}/VTK)

Then in the PV3BUILDDIR, the cmake variable PARAVIEW_ENABLE_PYTHON turns
on/off python wrapping for paraview and hides the VTK_WRAP_PYTHON variable.

In the VTKBUILDDIR, the VTK_WRAP_PYTHON variable works as normal.

But that would mean building a completely set of VTK-libraries? I was
trying to avoid that because I feared I might run into some kind of
DLL-Hell that way ("is this the VTK-libvtkcommon.so or the
Paraview-libvtkCommon.so I'm using?") But if it can not be avoided I
will try a separate build the way you described it

Paraview only wraps a subset the VTK classes for python use. So if you want
to try VTK's python interface, then you have to make a separate build.

Subject: [Paraview] Learning PV internals helped by the PV-GUI and python
Message-ID: <1183391957.6938.262.camel@namaste>

Hi,

I'm trying to learn about PV internals. As usual, I read and look the
source code, but thanks to Python console I'm able to play with the
learned concepts. In this message I post the way I'm doing it (including
a "tool" script), in case somebody else is interested or have some
comments.

The main steps are the following:

1. Start PV
2. Use the GUI to build the desired pipeline
3. Dump it into a Python script (using the "dump tool")
4. Analyze the script to see what is being done

5. Modify the script as desired
6. Test the script as stand-alone
7. Load the script in a running PV

The "dump tool" is an script (listed below) I've done in order to dump
the "PV session" into a python script. This way, it is possible to do
your work "using the PV GUI" or "scripting in python" mixed as you want.
For example, I applied a mask to a given dataset using the PV-GUI (with
the Calculator filter), and after I updated the script to save the
filled volume (it depended on different pipeline steps data) and to
perform the same operation on the N datasets I had (with a simple code
loop).

I don't know if it will be useful to somebody else, but for me it is
being a nice way to start to learn how PV works internally.

Regards, 

jor;)i

Message-ID: <468925B2.1080605@psc.edu>

What is "DOXYGEN_DOT_EXECUTABLE"? Since the VTK documentation doesn't seem to 
match PV 2.6.1 I though't I'd let cmake generate the documentation. However

    - cmake cannot find it
    - help only says "Graphviz Dot tool for using Doxygen"
    - CMake/PV books don't seem to mention it
    - www.doxygen.org seems to be down or at least ill

I'm using a Redhat Fedora Core 5 system.

Ok, so we tried this approach (vtkStringArrayHelper) but when we run  
ParaView we get the following error:

ERROR: In \Development\ParaView3\Servers\ServerManager 
\vtkSMProperty.cxx, line 449
vtkSMStringVectorProperty (040D0930): Could not create object of

Is there some where we need to Register the vtkStringArrayHelper  
class? or are we really barking up the wrong tree?

Subject: [Paraview] Is it possible to render two intersected ImageData as
	Volume?
Message-ID: <1183398217.6938.274.camel@namaste>

Hi,

When I load 2 intersected ImageData files and try to render them as
Volume, the last one is always rendered over the first one.

Is there any way to avoid this behaviour?

I also tried to make and assembly of both volumes before adding them to
the renderer, but I obtain the same result.

I first "detected the problem" in Paraview, but I also tested it in
"plain VTK" with the same behavior.

What am I doing wrong?

Thanks,

jor;)i

Subject: [Paraview] Best way to plot arrows on a subsample of data?
Message-ID: <000301c7bced$d027f8a0$0302a8c0@jonathanpc>

Hi,
I have a large amount of point data on an unstructured mesh.
 
How can I plot the vectors on a nice regular coarse sub-sample of the
underlying point data.
 
The options in the glyph filter using random and maximum points does not
give the points on a regularly shaped mesh which is what I want.
 
For example I may have a 1000x1000 square rectangle made up from an
unstructured grid with varying element sizes.
 
Now I would like to plot say just a 10x10 vector arrow plot on the surface
with uniform spacing.
 
I have tried a few things and have been unsuccessful.
 
Thanks for any help.
 
Jonathan.

Subject: [Paraview] Transparent surface and picture export problem
Message-ID: <d3d4ab920707030508m69ebc3a1xd368078589e7e24@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I am badly stucked with a hard to track problem. I am using Python
interface to ServerManager. I would like to ask the public if there is
someone else experiencing the same behavior.

The problem is:
I am using the vtkWindowToImageFilter object to get a screen shot of
the renderer. Since such a screen shot, the renderer is unable to plot
a scene with semi transparent objects anymore. It looks like the
renderer does not refresh the window content. There is no warning, no
exception. It somehow recovers, when the opacity is reset to one.

This problem seems to be hardware-dependent. I have tested the problem
on several machines. They are all running Windows XP. We are
experiencing the problem on nVidia graphics cards only. ATIs are fine.

OK - ATI Radeon X1800 Go
OK - ATI Radeon 9250
Err - nVidia GeForce 5300 Go
Err - nVidia Quadro Fx 1400 Go
Err - nVidia GeForce 7900 GS

I guess, it is vaguely related to this discussion.
http://public.kitware.com/pipermail/paraview/2006-November/004154.html

Where there any changes, in to code, related to this issue?

I have noticed that on nVidia cards we are not experiencing the fore
mentioned mottled surfaces. Unfortunately, the framerate is
significantly lower and we have this picture-export-bug. There is a
lot better framerate on the ATI cards and no problem with the export.
However, the transparent surface is mottled.

Any hints would be really appreciated,
Milan.

So, the old trick of running cmake twice seems to have fixed this.  Man, 
I *hate* this cmake quirk.  What causes it?

Now, on to the next issue:

This is with qt 4.3.0.  Looks like QtAssistantClient now has its own

Subject: [Paraview] crash when setting opacity on Paraview 3.0
Message-ID: <468B335C.2050308@auckland.ac.nz>

hi

I've just installed Paraview 3.0.2 on Win XP- very nice update to 
version 2.6 which I've been using up to now.  Thanks to all involved.

However whenever I set the opacity of any object, Paraview freezes- the 
CPU usage goes to 100% and Paraview is non-responsive.  This didn't 
happen with version 2.6.

Is this a known problem- are there any settings I can change to stop it 
happening?

(If it's any use, details of my setup are: Pentium 4 3.8 GHz,  2 GB RAM, 
Win XP Pro SP2, ATI Radeon X550 graphics card.)

Regards, Adrian

Subject: [Paraview] Problems is parallel visualization in ParaView2.6.X
Message-ID: <20070704081050.2724.qmail@f5mail13.rediffmail.com>

I am a newbie to parallel visualization and ParaView in general, I
have some doubts which are very fundamental.  

I am using ParaView2.6.X and trying to do some performance analysis
and dataset limit of ParaView in general as a part of an academic
project. I want to see what are the gains in CPU & memory usage and
time required to render a particular dataset when ParaView is run in
parallel.

I have structured data-sets with point attributes in form of VTK
legacy files.  When I run paraview in stand-alone mode on a single
machine, I am able to draw 5 iso-surface for structured grid datasets
upto 5 million points. But when I put the same VTK legacy files on 3
different computers (all have ParaView 2.6.X installed, os is Ubuntu/Debian) and run ParaView through mpi in distributed stand alone mode (as described in the ParaView book) on these 3 machines, the performance decreases for the isosurface case. Not only does the time taken to render final image, cpu/memory usage increase, I am only able to visualize till 1 million grid points. After 1 million point the get an error (this particular error is for a dataset of 2 million) :

raashid@ged:~/src/cvs/paraview-unix/bin$ mpirun -np 3 -x DISPLAY=10.101.11.71:0.0 ./paraview

ErrorMessage end
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
One of the processes started by mpirun has exited with a nonzero exit
code.  This typically indicates that the process finished in error.
If your process did not finish in error, be sure to include a "return
0" or "exit(0)" in your C code before exiting the application.

PID 16283 failed on node n0 (10.101.11.71) due to signal 11.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Am I using the wrong file type, if yes what should I use ?  
Is there some threshold limit I am voilating ?

I get the same error as above if I use a D3 filter before applying the
iso-contour.

Please help me with this problem, because I am in serious trouble.

Hi Adrian,

Does it freeze also if you just create a simple sphere (menu Sources->Sphere) and try to change the opacity?

Paraview 3.0 use depth peeling by default (if the card supports it) to deal with translucent polygonal geometry when ParaView 2.6 use only alpha blending.
You said you have an ATI card. It sounds bad for depth peeling because so far, the following ATI cards are not working with depth peeling:
* Radeon X1600 or X1900 on Mac with driver versions 1.4.40, 1.4,52, ,1.456
* FireFL V3330 with driver 2.0.6237 on Windows
* Radeon 9600XT on Mac with driver 1.4.18

In the implementation itself, depth peeling is bypassed for those configurations.

Can you follow those steps:

1. With your current driver version, run the following test:
$ ctest -R TestOpacity -V
Check if the test passed or not and also if the output contents either
this line: "depth peeling was used" or this line: "depth peeling was not used (alpha blending instead)"

2. Save the output of the following test in a text file:

$ ctest -R LoadOpenGLExtension -V &> output_old.txt

3. If there is a new driver version, update your driver

4. Do step 1 again

5. Do step 2 with output_new.txt instead of output_old.txt

6. Try Paraview again with a simple sphere and change opacity value.

7. Send me your results.

Regards.

Here is a little update about the issue. The fore mentioned problem is
clearly related with the usage of the depth peeling algorithm (It is
switched off on the ATI cards). When I explicitly turn off the
DepthPeeling on nVidia cards, my picture export runs without any
problems.

I get the same error as above if I use a D3 filter before applying the

Following the ideas of a technical report I tried to open the VTK
legacy file when ParaView server was running on 3 different computers
and the client was running on a different computer, apply the D3
filter and then save the file as PVTK unstructured grid format
(*.pvtu, with 1 ghost levels), close the paraview, start a fresh
paraview session with the same configuration (ParaView server was
running on 3 different computers and the client was running on a
different computer) load the master *.pvtu file and do the same
iso-contour example as above, the server again crashes and displays
the following error.(this particular error is for 2.5 million grid
points)

On the server side I get the message :

Raashid,

 

First, let me assure you that ParaView's parallel visualization and
rendering are efficient and scalable.  We have been able to use ParaView
to visualize 6 billion cell grids and have clocked rendering speeds of
over 8 billion polygons per second (albeit with much larger clusters
than you have set up).

 

As far as your problems are concerned, I'm going to have to do a lot of
guessing because I cannot replicate your problem and there are missing
pieces of information.  Looking at your mpirun command, it appears that
the DISPLAY variable is set to the same value on every process.  That
is, all processes in the ParaView server are creating a remote (for
them) X window on 10.101.11.71.  If that is the case, it is very, very
bad.  Basically, that would mean that all of the rendering is being
funneled into one computer.  Thus, instead of actually getting parallel
rendering, you are getting serial rendering plus the added overhead of
moving OpenGL primitives and images across the network plus the standard
overhead of parallel rendering.  Note that because you are only using 3
computers, I would not expect the parallel gains to be much higher than
the natural overhead of the parallel algorithms.  If your computers are
using a standard Ethernet connection, the relatively high latency and
low bandwidth will further erode the parallel gains.

 

The fact that your parallel job is crashing when you have a parallel job
with a sizeable data set suggests that you might not be using parallel
rendering at all.  You can shut off parallel rendering with the 3D view
properties or ParaView will shut it off for you if the server cannot
create the appropriate rendering windows.  When parallel rendering is
shut off, ParaView does the only thing left: funnel all of the geometry
to the client.

 

Verify that you are actually doing parallel rendering.  Start by running
in client/server mode (don't bother with parallel standalone: its
usefulness is basically limited to debugging).  Go to 3D View
Properties, verify that the checkbox next to "Composite" is checked and
move the slider all the way to the left (0 MBytes).  If everything is
working right, parallel rendering should now always be used.  The
easiest way to verify that is to observe the subsampling, which only
happens on interactive rendering when rendering in parallel.  Make sure
that the checkbox next to "Subsample Rate" is checked and move the
slider to the right to 4 Pixels or more.  Now when you rotate your 3D
rendering, it should look pixilated.

 

Offhand, I cannot think of another reason for your memory failures.  I
just used the Wavelet source to create a 125,000,000 cell structured
mesh on three nodes of our visualization cluster (each with 1 MB each),
then created 5 isosurfaces (~7.4 million cells and ~3.7 points) and
rendered it just fine.

 

One last piece of advice: don't run D3 on your structured data.
ParaView can balance your structured data without any help.  D3 is
designed for unstructured data.  The first thing it will do is convert
the structured data to unstructured, which is a much less efficient
representation.  It makes more sense to run D3 on the output of the
contour filter, but that is probably not worthwhile unless the contour
is very big and very unbalanced.

Subject: [Paraview] Newbie question about paraview's parallel
visualization procedure

 

I am a newbie to parallel visualization and ParaView in general, I
have some doubts which may be very fundamental.  

I am using ParaView2.6.X and trying to do some performance analysis
and dataset limit of ParaView in general as a part of an academic
project. I want to see what are the gains in CPU & memory usage and
time required to render a particular dataset when ParaView is run in
parallel. All machines are Intel Core Duo 2, 2GB DDR2 RAM, and 2GB
swap, all machines have NVidia 7series graphics cards and have
Debian/Ubuntu Linux

I have structured data-sets with point attributes in form of VTK
legacy files.  When I run paraview in stand-alone mode on a single
machine, I am able to draw 5 iso-surface for structured grid datasets
upto 5 million points. But when I put the same VTK legacy files on 3
different computers (all have ParaView 2.6.X installed) and run
ParaView through LAM/MPI in distributed stand alone mode (as described
in the ParaView book) on these 3 machines, the performance decreases
for the isosurface case. Not only does the time taken to render final
image, cpu/memory usage increase, I am only able to visualize till 1
million grid points. After 1 million point the get an error (this
particular error is for a dataset of 2 million) :

raashid@ged:~/src/cvs/paraview-unix/bin$ mpirun -np 3 -x

One of the processes started by mpirun has exited with a nonzero exit

If your process did not finish in error, be sure to include a "return

PID 16283 failed on node n0 (10.101.11.71) due to signal 11.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----

I get the same error as above if I use a D3 filter before applying the
iso-contour.


Following the ideas of a technical report I tried to open the VTK
legacy file when ParaView server was running on 3 different computers
and the client was running on a different computer, apply the D3
filter and then save the file as PVTK unstructured grid format
(*.pvtu, with 1 ghost levels), close the paraview, start a fresh
paraview session with the same configuration (ParaView server was
running on 3 different computers and the client was running on a
different computer) load the master *.pvtu file and do the same
iso-contour example as above, the server again crashes and displays
the following error.(this particular error is for 2.5 million grid
points)

Jonathan,

 

It sounds like you want to sample an unstructured grid on a course
structured grid and then glyph that.  As far as I know, there is no
filter in ParaView that resamples an unstructured grid onto a structured
grid.  There are, however, at least a couple of filters in VTK that will
do so: vtkShepardMethod and vtkGaussianSplatter.  It's fairly
straightforward to make a plugin to ParaView that will make these
available under the Filters menu.  There are a couple of Wiki pages
outlining how to do this.

 

For ParaView 2: http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView:Extend

 

For ParaView 3: http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Plugin_HowTo

 

I can also think of a way to do this resampling by repetitively using
the Cut filter (called Slice in ParaView 3).  If you look at the
parameters of this filter, you see a section called "Cut Offset Values"
("Slice Offset Values" in PV3).  This allows you to make a series of
cuts at regular intervals along a vector.  When you use this option on a
3D solid mesh, you get a series of planes.  If you apply the filter
again with the slice planes along a different vector, you get a
collection of lines.  Apply the filter a third time along yet another
vector and you get a collection of points, upon which you can apply the
glyph filter.

Subject: [Paraview] Best way to plot arrows on a subsample of data?

 

Hi,

I have a large amount of point data on an unstructured mesh.

 

How can I plot the vectors on a nice regular coarse sub-sample of the
underlying point data.

 

The options in the glyph filter using random and maximum points does not
give the points on a regularly shaped mesh which is what I want.

 

For example I may have a 1000x1000 square rectangle made up from an
unstructured grid with varying element sizes.

 

Now I would like to plot say just a 10x10 vector arrow plot on the
surface with uniform spacing.

 

I have tried a few things and have been unsuccessful.

 

Thanks for any help.

 

Jonathan.

The help is actually pretty descriptive (although the wording is
awkward).  Dot is one of the tools that come with the Graphviz package.
Doxygen uses this tool to create inheritance graphs.  You can download
Graphviz from www.graphviz.org.

Both ".k" and ".key" are used for input decks. The output files are
binary (not ASCII text) and are usually named "d3plot", "d3plot01", ...
Because the output files don't have any extension and because ParaView
uses file extensions to identify which reader to use, the
vtkLSDynaReader will take an input deck filename and try to find an
output file in the same directory. Sorry, but you'll need to run LS-Dyna
on the .k/.key files before you can use VTK's LS-Dyna reader to view the
models in them.

Ah, OK. I don't have access to LS-Dyna at the moment, so I guess I'm out

Hi,

 

I use the cell to point data filter quite frequently with no problems on
the older versions of paraview.  However, when I try the same thing on
the newer versions the data gets deleted and I'm left with nothing.

 

Is this a bug and is there any way around it?

 

Thanks,

That would make sense.  Normally ParaView will just give a warning when
a connection fails.  Maybe the firewall is somehow causing the POSIX
socket code to crash or to return in a state that causes ParaView to
crash later.

You should be able to attach a debugger to a running application.  You
should also be able to run paraview.app/Contents/MacOS/paraview from a
debugger.

I would not say it is expected, but it is not very surprising.  There
are several benign reasons this might be the case.

It would be helpful to see the artifacts.

That seems to be working for me, but if the reloaded session has some
readers that point to local files, that can cause some strange things to
happen.

We usually advise people not to use the renderserver/dataserver setup
unless you have a good reason to use it.  The simple client/server mode
usually works more efficiently because there is less copying of data
around.

If you still care about your problem (and you probably shouldn't), it
looks like the render server is reporting its hostnames as localhost.
That hostname is, of course, wrong when the data server tries to connect
to the render server.  You can use the --machines option to specify the
correct hostnames.

Subject: [Paraview] Unable to connect to pvserver running in parallel
	(paraView 2.6.X)
Message-ID: <20070706070133.19657.qmail@f5mail16.rediffmail.com>

I am running into a weird problem. I have 3 computers
ged=10.101.11.71, ender=10.101.11.72, bean=10.101.11.70 and all are
installed with ParaView2.6.X and have Debian/Ubuntu Linux

When I start pvserver on a single computer(ender) and connect the
pvclient on another computer(ged) to the running pvserver on ender,
everything works fine.

But when I run the pvserver as an LAM(7.1.2)/MPI program on 2
different computers (ender and bean, ender being the master node) and
try to connect the pvclient (on ged) to the master node of the
pvserver (ender) I get splash screen (which comes when we start the
paraview), but an invisible window is created whose title in the task
bar is "unable to open display",

I have enabled xhost to everyone (perhaps out of desperation) on the
computer where the client is running using xhost +. I have also used
X11 forwarding through ~/.ssh/config on all the computers

I don't get any error message of any sort even though the pvclient
fails to start.

raashid@ender:~/src/cvs/paraview-unix/bin$ mpirun -np 2 ./pvserver

Client connected.
Client connection closed.

raashid@ged:~/src/cvs/paraview-unix/bin$ ./pvclient --server-host=10.101.11.72

Please help me with this problem, because I am in serious trouble.

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView III July Development Snaphot 
Message-ID: <468E531E.5030102@gmail.com>

Hi Folks,

Development snapshot of ParaView III for July (3.1.0) is now available. 
The download links and announcements for all snapshots can be found at:
http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView_III_snapshots
(also at http://paraview.org/New/download.html)

This snapshot includes binaries for Windows, Linux (32 and 64 bit) and
Mac OS X and tar/zip balls for the source. The source can be obtained 
through CVS using tag "ParaView-3-1-July".

Here are some the things we have been working on:

* Improved chart controls. Most of the changes to the charts won't be 
visible to the user for the July snapshot. The interaction setup has 
changed. Pan, zoom, and zoom box are on the left, middle, and right 
mouse buttons respectively. The default colors for the line charts have 
changed.
* Better controls to layout text annotations.
* Improvements to the underlying rendering framework making it easier to 
add new views/representations.

Here's what coming soon:
* Improved animation track editor.
* Multiple input/multiple output support.
* Better element inspector to inspecting an entire dataset.
* Support for labeling points/cells.
* More chart improvements including:
   - Setting the line style and thickness on the line charts.
   - More axis layout control. (log scale, setting the range)
   - Legend.
   - Labels.

Look at http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView_III to get more 
information on the new features. We will continue adding more 
documentation to this page as we progress.

Have fun.

Message-ID: <OF299689BA.B59D12AC-ON85257310.0058EEC2-85257310.0059FBEF@beckman.com>

The key to this for me was to make sure I had it compiled with offscreen 
rendering, and then starting the server like this: (node01 is the main 
node)

node01> mpirun -np $PROCS `which pvserver` --use-offscreen-rendering 
$PVSERVOPTS &
[ output truncated ]
node01> pvclient $PVCLNTOPTS

mpirun takes care of migrating the paraview server onto the other nodes 
and making sure they're connected to one another properly, while the 
offscreen rendering switch enables it to do the rendering without 
connecting to an actual X display (via chromium, I believe) and then 
combined onto a single display on the client.  I spent some time messing 
around with the cmake configuration, so you might have to poke around 
there a bit too.

Hope this helps,
~Kyle

Thanks, Ken, that helped. After installing a couple of GraphViz rpms (main, 
development, python, tcl) cmake seemed to be happy and re-generated the make 
files. However, when I ran make it didn't look like it did anything new - that 
is, it didn't produce the documentation. Or maybe I'm not looking in the right 
place (the bin directory and its subdirectories).

Help!

(NB: this is a follow-up on a previous thread with several issues,

Ok, here are snapshots:
http://www.shaman.ibpc.fr/pv3_arefact1.png
http://www.shaman.ibpc.fr/pv3_arefact2.png
http://www.shaman.ibpc.fr/pv3_arefact3.png
http://www.shaman.ibpc.fr/pv3_arefact4.png

There are some kind of "ghost" planes that only appear when I use 
parallel rendering. The same data on a single node has none such 
planes. Furthermore the number of planes seems to depend on the number 
of processors: with two processors there is one plane dividing the data 
into two parts, with 4 processors there are two planes dividing into 
four parts.
I have seen this clearly with points, wireframe and volume 
representations. The artefacts depend on the viewing angle. One can 
make them disappear from some angle or make them more apparent choosing 
the right direction to look from.
Can it be avoided or corrected for?

Thanks in advance,
  Marc Baaden

NB: the snapshots were made using paraview 3.0.2 on MacOSX running a

	procedure
Message-ID: <20070708193747.16541.qmail@f5mail14.rediffmail.com>

I am a newbie to parallel visualization and ParaView in general and I
am some very basic problems with ParaView.

I am using ParaView2.6.X and trying to do performance analysis with
increasing dataset on ParaView as a part of an academic project. I
want to see what are the gains in CPU & memory usage and time required
to render a particular dataset when ParaView is runs in parallel. All
machines have Intel Core Duo 2, 2GB DDR2 RAM, and 2GB swap, NVidia 7series graphics cards and work on Debian/Ubuntu Linux.

I have structured data-sets with point attributes in form of VTK-XML
files (*.vts). When I run paraview in stand-alone mode on a single machine, I am able to draw glyph at each point of the data sets upto 1.5 million grid points. But when I put the same VTK XML files on 3 different computers (all have ParaView 2.6.X installed) and run ParaView through LAM/MPI in client-server mode where server is running on 2 computers and the client is running on another computer, performance decreases drastically. Not only does the time taken to render final image, cpu and memory usage increase, I am only able to dram glyps till 0.5 million grid points. After 0.5 million point the get an error (this particular error is for a dataset of 0.5 million) :

on client :

Am I using the wrong file type, if yes what should I use ? 
I have not changed any LOD parameters. Is there some threshold limit I
am violating ?

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview3 installation problem : unable to start Paraview
Message-ID: <20070708201853.5284.qmail@f5mail6.rediffmail.com>

I have checked out the fresh copy of sources today from cvs and tried
to build Paraview3, there was absolutely no error during the
installation but when I try to launch the paraview executable. raashid@bean:~/Desktop/ParaView3-unix/bin$ ./paraview Floating
point exception (core dumped)

The hardware configuration of the computer is Intel Core 2 Duo 2.4,
2GB DDR2 RAM and NVidia 7600 graphics card. The system runs on
Ubuntu 7.04.

I had the same problem with compiling ParaView3 before and got a reply
that it was due to a bug and will be fixed in future. Can somebody
please tell me when is this bug going to be fixed ?

Subject: [Paraview] Write Image Python Script Paraview3
In-Reply-To: <468EC774.2010804@stud.unibas.ch>
References: <468EC774.2010804@stud.unibas.ch>

Hi,

I use the methodology I exposed in 

http://public.kitware.com/pipermail/paraview/2007-July/005394.html

to learn about python scripting on Paraview.


You can try to open PV, perform "graphically by GUI" all the pipeline
you which, and then load the PV-Dump.py I posted and call to
Dump.allToPython( <filename> ) to print the python code necessary to
recreate the PV session. You will see how to "adding filters,
rotate...".


To save a screenshot of the render window in a PNG file you can use:

renderM.WriteImage("example.png", "vtkPNGWriter")

where renderW is the var us used when creating the render window
"renderM  = paraview.CreateRenderWindow()"



I attach you 2 files (inline):

- an example file created with Dump.allToPython( <filename> ) in which
you can see the "filter connection", and screenshot generation. The
script can be used as stand-alone script or loading it from PV.
- the PV-Dump.py utility updated to dump also camera information.


I hope it helps you ;)

PD: I'm preparing this slides:

http://namaste.maia.ub.es/public/vtk-volume-rendering-tutorial.pdf

to a presentation about VTK and PV. I will "finish" them on Friday, so
maybe you can find something interesting on them (on Friday I will fix
all PV section, because I will use an easy way to start with it...)

I cannot replicate your system exactly, but my Linux build is working
just fine.  Perhaps there is a problem with how your build is set up.
Here are a few obvious things to check:

 

Are you compiling against Qt 4.2.3?

 

If you run ldd paraview, does it report the same shared libraries you
linked against during build?

 

Can you compile debug (CMake variable CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE set to Debug)?
I'm not seeing much useful information in the stack trace.

I have checked out the fresh copy of sources today from cvs and tried
to build Paraview3, there was absolutely no error during the
installation but when I try to launch the paraview executable.

I had the same problem with compiling ParaView3 before and got a reply
that it was due to a bug and will be fixed in future. Can somebody
please tell me when is this bug going to be fixed ?

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview 3 parallel rendering artefacts (with
	Points, Wireframes and Volume representations)
In-Reply-To: <200707071819.l67IJjXc023993@apex.ibpc.fr>
References: <200707071819.l67IJjXc023993@apex.ibpc.fr>

The artifacts for the points and wireframe are caused by a technical
detail.  They happen because the points and wireframe are actually taken
from the surface, and the surface extraction used in this instance is
simplified to extract the surface local to the current process.  Thus,
those planes are the process boundaries.  You will also see this with
surfaces rendered with opacity less than 1.  You can get around this
problem by running the Extract Surface, which will use ghost cells to do
the right thing.

The artifacts with volume rendering look like a real bug.  I have
submitted a bug report about it.

http://www.paraview.org/Bug/bug.php?op=show&bugid=5315&pos=

Thanks for bringing this to our attention.

Hi Jordi,

nice job! Thanks, this is probably the python batch scripting ability,
which was missing in PV :-)

Message-ID: <200707101659.l6AGwtZJ018640@apex.ibpc.fr>


(NB: this is a follow-up on a previous thread with several issues,
focusing on one of them; it is still quite a long post, sorry )

I think I need to re-phrase my assumptions. The problem seem to be 
more generic related to connecting. It looks to me as if one gets 
crashes when there is a problem with finding or accessing a server upon 
the initial connection. 
Like giving a name that doesn't exist or cannot be resolved. This leads 
to EXC_BAD_ACCESS. There are two backtraces available here:
http://www.shaman.ibpc.fr/pv_bt.txt
http://www.shaman.ibpc.fr/pv_bt2.txt


Interestingly this also seems to systematically happen if I try to open 
a recent files from a distant server (Files -> Recent Files -> 
server:..data), whereas I can connect without a problem if I connect 
first and then open the recent file.


Another 'feature' is that the paraview client terminates when the 
server has some problem, like in:

:531; /opt/bin/paraview.app/Contents/MacOS/paraview 
ERROR: In /opt/src/paraview-cvs/Servers/Common/vtkServerConnection.cxx, line 67
vtkServerConnection (0x2b7f7e80): Server Connection Closed!
Broken pipe


BTW, I wonder how to interpret the corresponding server error:
:503; /ibpc/matrix/opt/paraview-3.0.2-Linux-x86/bin/pvserver --use-offscreen-rendering
\Listen on port: 11111

vtkXOpenGLRenderWindow (0x8216b48): Could not find a decent visual
Segmentation fault

Shouldn't offscreen rendering lead to the absence of OpenGL 
requirements? (NB: the above is the official pv-3.0.2 linux binary)

Further tests show that even with offscreen rendering, a window is 
first opened and then closed. This also happens every time that the 
drawing area is resized. Is this to be expected?


If I perform these tests using a parallel run on the same machine, it becomes even weirder 
with additional compositing artefacts like seen here (seen with points, 
wireframe, volume, surface and outline):
http://www.shaman.ibpc.fr/pv_composit1.png
http://www.shaman.ibpc.fr/pv_composit2.png
http://www.shaman.ibpc.fr/pv_composit3.png

Furthermore the OpenGL window that opens and closes on linux (with 
offscreen rendering) stays open and 'bizarre' on Mac OSX:
http://www.shaman.ibpc.fr/offscreen1.png


There are also crashes upon disconnecting. Here is another backtrace:

Hmm, what I meant is that it looks like if I start with -np X, exactly 
X-1 CPUs will run at 99% and the Xth CPU is idle unless I interact with 
the system. Still (from eg the artefacts mentioned in previous mails) 
paraview does subdivide the data into X parts and not into X-1 parts.

What are the benign reasons that you mention?

I also wonder how one should distribute CPUs, eg on a 4-CPU 
workstation, should one start the paraview client (~ 1 CPU) plus the pvserver 
with -np 3 (3 CPUs, total=4) or rather pvserver -np 4 (given that one 
process seems idle most of the time)?

Thanks in advance,

Subject: [Paraview] What's a good way to benchmark paraview?
Message-ID: <200707101747.l6AHlXbd021782@apex.ibpc.fr>


Hi,
given that I am testing different setups (number of CPUs, different 
machines, OS, graphics cards etc.), I would like to compare their 
performance. For that I'd like to use some benchmark on my data. I 
wonder whether paraview can report timing data (like frames per second) 
or some other useful measure for such (interactive) benchmarking?
thanks in advance,

	visualization procedure
Message-ID: <20070711074148.28832.qmail@f5mail13.rediffmail.com>

Thanks a lot for helping me with my frustrating condition.  The problem
with the invisible window being created whose title in the task bar is
"unable to open display" has gone, I compiled the sources again with
off-screen rendering enabled and start the paraview server with
off-screen rendering now.

Server end :
raashid@ender:~/src/cvs/paraview-unix-new/bin$ mpirun -np 2 ./pvserver --use-offscreen-rendering

Client End :
raashid@ged:~/src/cvs/paraview-unix-new/bin$ ./pvclient --server-host=10.101.11.72

The client gets connected to the server and works fine.

You suggested to check the check-box next to Composite and move the
slider all the way to the left (0 MBytes) and then try to visualize.
When I do this no matter how small the dataset is when I open it and
press the accept button a message is displayed saying "Server
connection has been dropped. ParaView client will be terminated"

The terminal output on client was :

raashid@ged:~/src/cvs/paraview-unix-new/bin$ ./pvclient --server-host=10.101.11.72
Connected to server
ErrorMessage
# Error or warning: There was a VTK Error in file: /home/raashid/src/cvs/ParaView/Servers/Common/vtkServerConnection.cxx (67)
 vtkServerConnection (0xc0ee1b8): Server Connection Closed!
ErrorMessage end

The terminal output on server was :

raashid@ender:~/src/cvs/paraview-unix-new/bin$ mpirun -np 2 ./pvserver --use-offscreen-rendering
Listen on port: 11111
Waiting for client...
Client connected.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
One of the processes started by mpirun has exited with a nonzero exit
code.  This typically indicates that the process finished in error.
If your process did not finish in error, be sure to include a "return
0" or "exit(0)" in your C code before exiting the application.

PID 6385 failed on node n0 (10.101.11.72) due to signal 11.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Also I tried 3 different cases of composting for a dataset of 0.5
million (vtk-xml file type, try to draw glyph at each point)

Case 1. Composting is off 

Case 2. Composting is on and value is increased (to 10.0 MB)

Case 3. Composting in on and value is turned to 0.0 MB

In all cases I noticed one thing, on the lower left side of the
window, where the the running process is display, every time when the
message "MPIMoveData" is displayed the paraview crashes.

I dont know if this thing is useful, but I just wanted to let you know.

Dear all,

now that multiple outputs are enabled in ParaView3 (CVS version), things
are getting interesting. However, I am finding a problem and wonder if
others have seen it too.

Say my reader creates two outputs, and they differ in the number and
names of the PointData fields (Scalars and Vectors) they produce.

Well, if I connect Glypgh to "output 1", it does not allow selection of
the variables names of Output 1, but rather of "Output 0", which makes
no sense at all since they don't exist in my case. It's probably that
since the dawn of time in ParaView, Glyphs (and possibly other filters)
look by default on the 0-th output. Is this a bug? Have others seen
this?

That sounds like a bug.  I registered it in our bug tracker.

http://www.paraview.org/Bug/bug.php?op=show&bugid=5325&pos=

Please take the time to add more details.  A simple example (with any
necessary files attached) that can reproduce the problem is always
helpful.

PV3 has pvpython instead of pvbatch. pvbatch read Tcl scripts; pvpython 
reads Python scripts. Since ParaView 3 does not use Tcl, pvbatch will 
not be back.

I can go to www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView, login, and edit a few of my wiki 
pages as expected. However, when I try to go to

    www.paraview.org/ParaView3/index.php/Default_Color_Map

the wiki

   - prompts me to login again or create an account
   - when I click on "Create Account" it instead redisplays the login prompt

I've looked at the color map page before (and bookmarked it) so something has 
changed. I've also tried searching for that page from 
www.paraview.org/ParaView3 to no avail.

Help!

For me the key value of the previous batch support was that one could prepare a 
batch job by running PV interactively, building the needed display, then 
writing the current state to a file. The saved file always needed a little 
editing but was a huge help in preparing the batch job.

Is there a way to do the analogous thing with PV3? That is, save the state of 
an interactive session as a Python script?

Yes! I now have two sets of documentation, for ParaView 2.6.1 and VTK 5.1.0.

Currently, we cannot save a python script (similar to the batch script) 
from the current GUI state. However, one can save the state xml from the 
client and simply load the state back in the python code using 
vtkSMProxyManager::LoadState().

Also pvpython provides a module (paraview) which can be used to create 
displays (which are now called representations), views etc, so it is 
possible to write python scripts from scratch without too much effort.

I use the PV-Dump.py I posted in:

http://public.kitware.com/pipermail/paraview/2007-July/005427.html


To "prepare a batch job interactively", save it to a python script and
"perform a little editing" to obtain the "batch script".

Is it ok for you?



Fabian Braennstroem said it was ok form him
http://public.kitware.com/pipermail/paraview/2007-July/005432.html

and Michael Martinec -that has posted the original question
http://public.kitware.com/pipermail/paraview/2007-July/005423.html -
emailed directly to me to say it was also ok for him.



Could we improve this PV-Dump.py (it is a script I coded just to show PV
scripting capabilities in a presentation) and adding it as a "tool
script" in the PV distribution?

Hi Jordi,

That looks like a very useful method for simulating the old batch support. And 
I like your idea of including it in the PV3 distribution.

Better yet, it would be nice to integrate it into PV so that the old "Save 
Batch" button actually writes the Python file. The old "pvbatch' program could 
return as a Python program that loads the saved file and makes whatever small 
changes are needed for the batch environment.

Take a look at the mail list, two, three days ago there was a
'PV-Dump.py'-Python script which actually does, what you want...

 Hi all

 I?m trying to add a reader into ParaView - version 2.6, using the External
Modules, but when I run CMake it shows an error message saying that it
cannot find the source directory of the reader. The fact is that its source
IS on the directory I pointed, as well as its ParaViewImport.cmake file.


Can anyone help me please?  I can?t make any progress until this step is
solved.



Thanks

There are a few 'quirks' that sometimes people miss when doing this.

Setup: Project Naming - If your project is called "MyParaViewReader"  
and is in a directory called "MyParaViewReader" then just inside that  
directory you need a file called "MyParaViewReaderParaViewImport.cmake".

In ccmake, the "Source" directory for "MyParaViewReader" would be:

c:\Projects\MyParaViewReader  (for windows - adjust for unix/OS X)

ParaView's cmakelists should be able to find your project at this point.

Try that and let us know.

PS: If you are allowed to send the code out, tar/zip your project and  
send it to me and I will take a look at it.

The method I've used for 2.4 through 2.6.2 is to put all the files for a new 
module into one directory (in the attached examples it is /whatever/Cloud). I 
call this a "kit" and there can be many. Then, when I first run cmake, have it 
read an initialization file

    cmake -CcompositeInit_partial.cmake <srctree>

which points to all the kits (see attachment). I added "_partial" because I've 
removed references to other kits. Note that this file includes the path to the 
kit, e.g., /whatever/Cloud. You could instead set these parameters using ccmake 
but if its in a file you can more easily reuse the settings.

If you are adding more than one kit (I currently add 4) just edit the 
initialization file to point to them all.

Next, look at a few things in the kit, i.e., your module's directory. You'll 
need a file like cloudParaViewImport.cmake (attached) which include some 
important file names.

Finally, the file that describes your module's GUI must include the path to the 
file describing the server manager connection (see cloudGUI_partial.xml). It 
seems like cmake already has this information but it apparently needs some help.

Hopefully something in all this will suggest some little change in your setup 
that will get you going again.

Message-ID: <4697368D.70705@gmx.de>

Hi,

I just started using ParaView and would like to help. Open "problem" I
came along were the openfile-dialogs.

There are nice openFile-dialogs in Qt. Depending on the operating-system
they use the native openfile-dialogs the user ist used to. I would like
to see ParaView3 using this default Qt-openfile-dialogs
(QFileDialog::getOpenFileName()).

Right now I miss the possibility to write the directory-path in the
combobox using the keyboard instead clicking. Also it is not possible to
change the type of view or delete directories/files.

Thanks for this great software...!

Greetings
Jens

Jens,

The ParaView 3 development team deliberated heavily over whether to use
the native file dialog box.  Ultimately we decided to use our own file
dialog box.  Part of the reason is to maintain consistency when browsing
local files and when browsing remote files in client/server mode (in
which case there is no native file dialog box available).  But the major
reason for using our own is to be able to resolve file names before
displaying them.  For example, if you load a file that has extensions
that form part of a sequence (e.g. filename.00, filename.01,
filename.02, etc.) then the reader (typically) treats them as group of
files containing a single data set.  To help with the file browsing,
ParaView's browser will collect all the files in the sequence and show
them as a single file, which is logically how they will be read.  There
is no way to implement this using the native file dialog.

We have worked hard to mimic all the nice features of the Windows native
file dialog.  The ability to type in a directory is already there.  Just
type the directory in the "File name" line edit and hit enter.  That
works about the same as the Windows version.

If you feel there is something else important that is missing, feel free
to submit a bug.

-Ken

I built a 12 workstation cluster to use as a rendering cluster for 
ParaView.
I am running X on all nodes and using 2.6.1 I get the infamous "cant 
open display".

My question is that if I want to take full advantage of the graphics 
cards should I build 2.6.1
to use OSMesa and offscreen rendering ?  Does this approach use hardware 
rendering?

Well, thank you all for the tips, but I still cannot build ParaView with the
reader...and I?m a new user at the software.

The problem is that when I use SET (ANALYZE_SRCS
${ANALYZE_SOURCE_DIR}/vtkAnalyzeReader.cxx) at
ANALYZEParaViewImport.cmakean error message appears:
CMake Error: Cannot find source file "C:\psato\ANALYZE\vtkAnalyzeReader.cxx"
for target "vtkPVFilters". So, I cannot configure the files.

I tried to change the extension .cxx for .cpp and when I did, configure
runned fine but when I clicked OK to generate build files I receievd more
error messages:
CMake Error: Unknown Target referenced: maketcltk
CMake Error: Target: vtkCommonTCL depends on unknown target: maketcltk
CMake Error: Error in generation process, project files may be invalid
And CMake closed

Even though, I opened ParaView, selected the xml file at Import Package and
tried to open an analyze file. One more error message showed:
The instruction at "0x011d6742" referenced memory at "0x00000000". The
memory could not be "read"

Any suggestions?

Thanks

A while back during a ParaView training I asked the same questions  
and got the same response. I agree with the reasoning. I am on OS X  
and one of the features that a native file dialog has are all my  
shortcuts that I am used to in the "Finder". During that same  
training one of the trainers asked me if I knew how to get that list.  
At the time I did not but now I do. Who should I work with or where  
do I add into the ParaView code to allow your file dialog to display  
this list? I see that by default my home folder is prepopulated in  
the list.

   The concept/code is simple. You just have to parse a .plist file  
located at ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.sidebarlists.plist. This  
list is binary so some Apple APIs will be needed to parse the list.

If you are using "Extra External Modules" then you code is compiled  
directly into ParaView. You should not need to "import" the package.

Also, when you got the first error message about not being able to  
find the file, did you check that the path that cmake is generating  
does in fact exist:

> "C:\psato\ANALYZE\vtkAnalyzeReader.cxx"

Does that path exist?

Can you pack up your project and send it out? It we can take a look  
at your project we may be able to find the mistake/problem quicker.

No, it does not.  You will have to get your local (to each server
process) X connections running if you want hardware acceleration.  To
allow the server processes to open the displays, make sure you do all
the following:

1. Have xdm run on each cluster node at startup.
2. Disable all security on the X server.  That is, allow any process to
open a window on the x server without having to log in.
3. Make sure each process is run with the DISPLAY environment set to
"localhost:0" (or just ":0").

To enable the last condition, it is often helpful to use the env program
in the mpirun call.  So you would have something like

mpirun -np 12 /bin/env DISPLAY=localhost:0 ./pvserver

An easy way to test your setup is to use the glxgears program.  Unlike
pvserver, it will quickly tell you if it cannot connect to the local
server.

mpirun -np 12 /bin/env DISPLAY=localhost:0 /usr/X11R6/bin/glxgears

In ParaView3/Servers/Common/vtkPVFileInformation.cxx, the 
GetSpecialDirectories() can be implemented for Mac OS X.
Both client and server side file browsing use that.
Sounds like it should be pretty simple.  You can make a bug tracker item 
and if you implement it, attach the patch.

    I spent some time getting to know CoreFoundation this weekend and  
I came up with some code that will display what the user has in their  
"sidebar" in the finder in the ParaView File Dialogs. The code was  
taken mostly from Apple examples and is long and tedious. I did not  
do much more that write it and test it on OS X 10.4.10 Intel. The  
code is almost 200 lines long. I was not sure about how ParaView's  
design philosophy is but I was tempted to break all this mac code out  
into its own source file. Maybe we could do the same for windows? I  
did add two new private methods for OS X only that help break up what  
I am trying to do. I am attaching the two files as I have never used  
diff and now is not a good time to learn. I started out with the  
ParaView 3.1.0 July Snap shot.

I also have a small qualm about the ParaView File Dialog. In the  
Filter drop down list, the list is as wide as my monitor because  
ParaView seems to want to make one giant string out of all the  
extensions. I can patch the file easy enough but we should discuss  
what is the "correct" thing to do on OS X.

Lastly, if the method void vtkPVFileInformation::GetDirectoryListing 
() I also patched so that on OS X hidden directories are not listed,  
as this is the default user experience on OS X.

Thanks for the help with where to patch into the code. I hope this  
code can make it into the next branch/release of ParaView.

I think there's something preventing Google (and some other engines) 
from crawling the public.kitware.com site properly.  I tried the 
following search at google.com:

[Paraview] Crash Reading pvs Using Volume Vis site:public.kitware.com

I'm pretty sure the "site:" syntax is what the little search bar at the 
top of the pipermail page uses and just sends it on to Google. 
Interestingly enough, I tried it at a few other sites and sometimes it 
works, sometimes not:

google.com	only finds bug reports
lycos.com	only finds mailing list posts
live.com	only finds bug reports
yahoo.com	works fine
altavista.com	works fine
ask.com		only finds mailing list posts

Don't know what it is though.  The robots meta tags seems correct 
(index/nofollow for the posts and noindex/follow for the archive lists). 
  Also the robots.txt file doesn't appear to be excluding anything.

Hi Patricia,

The .cxx extension is not a problem for Visual C++. ParaView is built 
daily using that compiler with no problems related to the file extension.

The last sentence of that Wiki says "If we want the code to be permanently 
available in ParaView after compiling (without having to setup environment 
variable or loading XML file), we must use 
PARAVIEW_INCLUDE_SERVERMANAGER_RESOURCES and PARAVIEW_INCLUDE_GUI_RESOURCES 
macros in the ParaView module import file."

The attached file sets these. I think the attached file was included in a bunch 
I sent last week - sorry for the duplication. I never need to use "import 
package" - I just start PV and its all there.

Subject: [Paraview] Animation / Loading of different files
Message-ID: <469CE3FA.9010809@unibas.ch>

Hi,

We are using the current development distribution of Paraview and we 
would like to animate a transient simulation that is is stored in the 
following files: 0000xxx-solution.vtu  [with xxx starting from zero to 200].

Unfortunately, we can not find a mode so that the Paraview3 
automatically identifies that this is a transient simulation and 
automatically load the solution files when creating an animation. This 
option was part of the 2.6 version ....

Thanks for the help.
Olaf

Message-ID: <3164903E-E067-443D-93EE-1197416C10FB@gmail.com>

I am writing a reader that inherits from vtkImageAlgorithm. Generally  
the reader works just fine EXCEPT for the problem that the  
"RequestData" method is being called at least 6 times in a row. I am  
not sure what the cause of this might be although I have run into  
this in the past where I was "updating" the output data object during  
the RequestData, which was then forcing a pipeline update. I have  
pretty much commented out most of the RequestData method and it still  
gets called multiple times in a row.
    I have NOT checked if the same code exhibits this behavior on PV  
2.6.x yet.. but that may be my next step.

Anyone ever have this type of problem? Any ideas?

Thanks for the help

One quick and dirty workaround: create a PVD file that points to the vtu files. 
I think I remember Kitware saying that what you want to do won't make it into 
the 3.* version for a while.

I've seen that when RequestData returns a value that signals an error.

Only a crude shot in the dark: set a breakpoint at the start of RequestData and 
see if the traceback suggests why the call was made. I've written several 
readers for 2.6.1 and haven't seen the problem you report except when the 
reader's return value indicated an error.

Message-ID: <E1BD088683EF744ABFB0ED62370BEB8B08AEBB04@ERD-ML4ERD.erd.ds.usace.army.mil>

two things:

in paraview 2.6.2, the exodus reader reads my data file just fine and i've
used it to great success.
however, i've been recently asked to do something with the node sets that are
part of the exodus data.
it seems to read them in okay; but as soon as i try to change the view of the
camera (i.e. the scene is re-rendered) it crashes paraview. i get an error
about an array type mis-match.

i recall that there was some 'play' about the exodus reader a while back; but
i can't find it in the archives.


question 2:

paraview 3 won't even read my exodus files that paraview 2.6.2 reads fine.
i've tried the released pv3 and a cvs build we did a few weeks ago.
not much to go on; i don't get much feedback from pv3.
anyone have any ideas?

thanks.

I finally got a debugger working and setting a breakpoint at the top  
of RequestData is interesting to say the least. The stack is anywhere  
from 69 to 72 deep at that point. Copying the stack from each time  
the break point is hit and pasting into text files, the running a  
diff against two of the files shows the the differences are about the  
39 to 42 depth. All this is way beyond me at this point. I can send  
the stack traces if anyone wants to look through them.. ;-)

	Maybe I will try and compile this against 2.6.x and see if the  
problem persists. I have written another reader that inherits from  
PolyDataAlgorithm and I don't have this sort of trouble. I am sure it  
is something stupid that I am doing. I am looking at the ImageReader2  
class to get an idea of what I _should_ be doing at this point.

Another thought.  Are you calling Modified (either directly or
indirectly) in RequestData?  If the modified flag gets called, VTK will
assume that the data is out of date and run RequestData again whenever
possible.  Check the value of the MTime ivar at the beginning and the
end of RequestData.  It should be the same.

Nope:

Here is what I have for my RequestData Method:
int vtkH5PhaseFieldReader::RequestData( vtkInformation* vtkNotUsed 
(request),
                     vtkInformationVector** vtkNotUsed(inputVector),
                     vtkInformationVector* outputVector )
{

   std::cout << "\n--------------------\nEntering RequestData method"  
<< std::endl;
   if (NULL == this->FileName) {
     std::cout << "FileName must be specified" << std::endl;
     vtkDebugMacro( << "FileName must be specified");
     return 0;
   }

   vtkInformation* outInfo = outputVector->GetInformationObject(0);
   vtkImageData *output = vtkImageData::SafeDownCast(outInfo->Get 
(vtkDataObject::DATA_OBJECT()));
   std::cout << "Modified Time: " << this->GetMTime() << std::endl;
#if 0
... Whole lotta stuff commented out
#endif
   std::cout << "{end} Modified Time: " << this->GetMTime() <<  
std::endl;
   std::cout << "---Done with RequestData Method --------" << std::endl;
   return 1;
}

This returns the following to the console when I open one of my files:

--------------------
Entering RequestData method
Modified Time: 51294
{end} Modified Time: 51294
---Done with RequestData Method --------

--------------------
Entering RequestData method
Modified Time: 51294

--------------------
Entering RequestData method
Modified Time: 51294
{end} Modified Time: 51294
---Done with RequestData Method --------

It is amusing to turn ON Debug in my class as there seems to be  
things getting set between the calls.. not sure if this is important  
or not. It would seem that the time never gets changed though.

  Should I be using vtkImageAlgorithm for a Reader? Or is there  
something better/more up to date? We were specifically targetting PV  
3.x due to the multiple render window capability.

Can you please send the exact error message?

Can you provide an example file?

What does that mean? Does PV3 crash? Does it
just show an empty screen? Print an error
message?

Without more specific error messages or a way
to replicate your problems, there's not much
to try. One thing you can do is renamed your
ExodusII files so that they end in ".exii" (instead
of ".exo", ".g", ...). If you read in files
with this different extension, a different Exodus
reader will be used -- one under development
to support new features.

For those playing along at home I recompiled ParaView 2.6 and the  
reader's RequestData gets fired at least 4 times there. So I am just  
generally not doing something correct with this reader.

There are time steps involved, is that a problem?


I use things like
   vtkSetStringMacro(ActivePhase);
   vtkGetStringMacro(ActivePhase);

and then during RequestInformation I will call SetActivePhase(...),  
will that cause the pipeline to update?

Congratulations!  You found a bug in ParaView.  It has probably been
there a while, but nobody has been able to find it until now.

It looks like the problem is not with the exodus reader but with the LOD
mechanism.  When ParaView tries to decimate the geometry, and the
geometry only has vertices, it crashes.  You should be able to prevent
this by disabling the LOD.  Uncheck the box next to "LOD Threshold" (in
"3D View Properties" for ParaView 2.X and in the Settings dialog box for
ParaView 3.X).  That should prevent the problem from happening.

Development for ParaView 2 is dead, so I don't expect the problem to be
fixed there.  I registered a bug for ParaView 3.

Those macros typically call Modified. Print the modified time at the start of 
RequestInformation and at the end of RequestData. If they differ that may 
trigger an update. If that is the case then why isn't it an infinite loop?

RequestInformation is only being called once.... which I forgot to  
mention.. But I will check just to make sure.. .. Checking...... Yep  
only once where the ModifiedTime is different from the top of the  
method to the bottom of the method.

Well, I worked it down to the following lines that appear in the  
RequestInformation() method:

#if 0
   outInfo->Set( vtkDataObject::ORIGIN(), DataOrigin, 3 );
   outInfo->Set( vtkDataObject::SPACING(), DataSpacing, 3 );
   this->DataExtent[0] = this->DataExtent[2] = this->DataExtent[4] = 0;
   this->DataExtent[1] = xDim;
   this->DataExtent[3] = yDim;
   this->DataExtent[5] = zDim;
   outInfo->Set( vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::WHOLE_EXTENT(),  
DataExtent, 6 );

   vtkDataObject::SetPointDataActiveScalarInfo(outInfo,  
VTK_TYPE_FLOAT32,1);
#endif

If I leave it so that code is compiled, then my RequestData is called  
multiple times. I looked at some other readers (ImageReader2) and it  
seems to be setting this ok, but I think that reader is based off the  
older pipeline..

Howdy,

Can ParaView (2.6.1 or 3.0.2 or any other version) read spyplot case
files?

A comment near the top of ParaView3/Servers/Filters/vtkSpyPlotReader.h
reads:

// vtkSpyPlotReader is a reader that reads SPCTH Spy Plot file format
// through an ascii meta file called the "case" file (extension .spcth).
This
// case file lists all the actual binary files that describe a dataset.
Each

I have a simple case file like this:

blackrose1.sandia.gov:/scratch2/jgoldma/mbboslo/Golevka/gv10/small_test>
cat somefiles.spcth
spcth.0
spcth.1
spcth.2
spcth.3

But ParaView didn't seem to read the spcth.* files when I tried opening
somefiles.spcth. I just got a blank screen and no Cell Arrays are in the
properties tab.

Message-ID: <F15F7A20-F57B-4E2E-AEC2-21926A5C5E96@gmail.com>

After looking at this all day today, I the big difference is:

If I include the following code:

   outInfo->Set( vtkDataObject::ORIGIN(), DataOrigin, 3 );
   outInfo->Set( vtkDataObject::SPACING(), DataSpacing, 3 );

   this->DataExtent[0] = this->DataExtent[2] = this->DataExtent[4] = 0;
   this->DataExtent[1] = xDim;
   this->DataExtent[3] = yDim;
   this->DataExtent[5] = zDim;
   outInfo->Set( vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::WHOLE_EXTENT(),  
DataExtent, 6 );

Then after each call to RequestData, a call to SetAbortExecute (0) is  
called which I think is causing an update to occur. If I leave the  
above code out, then only GetAbortExecute() is called, which is fine  
as it does not monkey with the ModifiedTime.

Now I would be more than happy to leave out the above code, but doing  
so leaves the resulting vtkImageData object not quite "right", ie, It  
will show an outline in paraview, but nothing else. Maybe someone can  
fill me in on what is going on.

I am thinking of maybe trying to inherit from vtkStructuredGrid  
instead. Our data is just a regular array of Voxels with some extra  
scalar and vector attributes on them.

I do not have this problem with a vtkPolyDataAlgorithm..

Brian Wylie helped me discover that the first line of the file needs to
have the word "spycase"

Subject: [Paraview] Spyplot case files

Howdy,

Can ParaView (2.6.1 or 3.0.2 or any other version) read spyplot case
files?

A comment near the top of ParaView3/Servers/Filters/vtkSpyPlotReader.h
reads:

// vtkSpyPlotReader is a reader that reads SPCTH Spy Plot file format //
through an ascii meta file called the "case" file (extension .spcth).
This
// case file lists all the actual binary files that describe a dataset.
Each

I have a simple case file like this:

blackrose1.sandia.gov:/scratch2/jgoldma/mbboslo/Golevka/gv10/small_test>
cat somefiles.spcth
spcth.0
spcth.1
spcth.2
spcth.3

But ParaView didn't seem to read the spcth.* files when I tried opening
somefiles.spcth. I just got a blank screen and no Cell Arrays are in the
properties tab.

Using vtkStructuredGrid instead of vtkAlgorithm is, I think, a bad idea 
as only the later supports the latest update mechanism.

I also wrote a reader that produces structured data. I set the extent as 
you have done but don't perform the first two "Set"s. Instead I set the 
origin and spacing in the output data structure.

Just to jump in - I have been using a lot of particle datasets with only 
vertices and I've not experienced crashing problems. I have had strange 
LOD behaviour...but that's another thing... I'll will take a look at the 
LOD mechanism next time I notice anything strange.

I just would like to inform you that on the latest development version
3.10 the time filter doesn't update the time value anymore.

I use ensight reader to read data from fluent.

The time filter is working well on the stable release with the same
data.

Multiple execution problems like this usually occur due to
inconsistency between what the pipeline requests and what the
algorithm produces. Can you verify that your reader is producing the
extent requested (with UPDATE_EXTENT)? The extent of the data the
reader produces has to match UPDATE_EXTENT().

THANKS.. That was the problem.. mostly.. I included the following:

   outInfo->Set( vtkDataObject::ORIGIN(), DataOrigin, 3 );
   outInfo->Set( vtkDataObject::SPACING(), DataSpacing, 3 );
   this->DataExtent[0] = this->DataExtent[2] = this->DataExtent[4] = 0;
   this->DataExtent[1] = xDim-1;
   this->DataExtent[3] = yDim-1;
   this->DataExtent[5] = zDim-1;
   outInfo->Set( vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::WHOLE_EXTENT(),  
DataExtent, 6 );
   outInfo->Set( vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_EXTENT(),  
DataExtent, 6 );

in the RequestInformation and now RequestData only gets called once.  
There was also a bug in my last code where I was not quite  
calculating the DataExtent correctly. I _had_ :
t this->DataExtent[1] = xDim;

which should have been:

this->DataExtent[1] = xDim-1;

Thanks to all those who replied with Ideas and ultimately the  
solution. I'll write this little gem in my notes so next time I have  
a better idea of what all is needed in a Reader based on  
vtkImageAlgorithm.

You should not be setting UPDATE_EXTENT. You should let the pipeline
set it and respond to it appropriately in RequestData().

By the way, we do not support Qt 4.3.0 yet. You should be using 4.2.3.

Subject: [Paraview] Construct Point Set in Python
Message-ID: <b45d6a1e0707180715j5c47427dxadfa63dab87702af@mail.gmail.com>

Currently I am unable to figure out how to create a set of points in
paraview with the python shell or programmable filter. I have constructed a
script
that can read a database and output a single point source for each point
(see below). Is there something I am missing to instead construct a point
set, or will I have to create a point set source object first?

#!/usr/bin/env python
import time
import sys
import paraview
from pysqlite2 import dbapi2 as sqlite

COLS_TO_GET = 100

# Locate the view to which we'll add the "display". All views are
# registered in the group "view_modules" with the proxy manager.
#pxm = paraview.pyProxyManager()
iter = pxm.group_iter("view_modules");
activeView = None
for proxy in iter:
  if proxy.IsA("vtkSMRenderModuleProxy"):
    activeView = proxy
    break
if activeView:
  db = sqlite.connect('/home/rmaynard/ProjParaview/rmaynard/Python/mine.db')

  c = db.cursor()

  #start time tracking
  startTime = time.time()

  c.execute('select * from data where lbExpl > 0')
  cols = c.fetchmany(COLS_TO_GET)
  for row in cols:
    grab the row x, y, z
    (x,y,z) = row[:3]
    point = paraview.CreateProxy("sources","PointSource","sources",
"point.%d.%d.%d"%(x,y,z))
    point.SetCenter(x,y,z)
    point.UpdateVTKObjects();
    disp = paraview.CreateDisplay(point, activeView);

  activeView.StillRender();
  #end time tracking
  endTime = time.time()
  print endTime-startTime
  c.close()
  db.close()

Then I do not understand what I should be doing. What I put "works"  
but maybe not in the "right" way.

In my RequestInformatio(...) I have:

   outInfo->Set( vtkDataObject::ORIGIN(), DataOrigin, 3 );
   outInfo->Set( vtkDataObject::SPACING(), DataSpacing, 3 );
   outInfo->Set( vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::WHOLE_EXTENT(),  
DataExtent, 6 );
   outInfo->Set( vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_EXTENT(),  
DataExtent, 6 );

Then in my RequestData(...) I have:

vtkImageData *output = vtkImageData::SafeDownCast(outInfo->Get 
(vtkDataObject::DATA_OBJECT()));
   output->SetScalarType(VTK_TYPE_FLOAT32);
   output->SetSpacing( 1.0, 1.0, 1.0 );
   output->SetOrigin( 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 );
   output->SetDimensions( xDim, yDim, zDim );
   output->SetNumberOfScalarComponents( 1 );
   output->AllocateScalars();
... Load the data from the file into the 'output' object
   return 1;

I see other readers doing it this way, or so it seems, it was late  
last night. So my question is:

How _should_ I be doing this? I am not sure there is a time where I  
would only update part of the volume. I always want to read all the  
volume from the file. Maybe I am just missing something.

Is the "support" for Qt 4.3 because no one is testing against Qt 4.3  
or because there is API breakage between 4.2.3 and 4.3? I asked  
because on both windows xp and OS X this was the only way I can get a  
stable ParaView 3.1.0 to compile with our code...

No. There might be a possibility in the future.. This reader really  
lends itself to parallism. The filtering at the end of the reader is

Both.  There are often changes to the API between minor releases of Qt,
and if they run over something that ParaView is using, it makes it very
difficult to support both.  But more importantly, we simply do not have
the resources to support multiple versions of Qt.  With changes in bugs
and features in Qt, it becomes too hard to determine if a problem lies
with Qt, ParaView, or a combination of both.  Thus, we limit ourselves
to one version of Qt at a time.  If you want to use a different version,
I am afraid you are on your own.

What's this? KitWare complaining about undocumented API Breakage between
versions of a library?

Some would call it irony, others poetic justice.


Sorry, just couldn't pass that one up.

I know this has probably been asked already, but I can't find a  
recent answer. Why is Paraview 3.x not being released with a PowerPC  
binary?

The Snapshot page http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView_III_snapshots  
suggests PowerPC binaries would begin being released back in March!

Turning VTK_USE_RPATH  back on will fix this problem.
That flag should always be ON for ParaView builds on the Mac.

You can create a file describing the time-series as a collection: the
following syntax would do it:

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<VTKFile type="Collection" version="0.1" byte_order="LittleEndian"

I have a similar problem. I have a few hundred vtk legacy files I want to
load. What sort of file can I create to do this?

You can create a file describing the time-series as a collection: the
following syntax would do it:

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<VTKFile type="Collection" version="0.1" byte_order="LittleEndian"
compressor="vtkZLibDataCompressor">
?<Collection>
???<DataSet timestep="0" file="0000000-solution.vtu"/>
???<DataSet timestep="1" file="0000001-solution.vtu"/>
???<DataSet timestep="2" file="0000002-solution.vtu"/> .........//please
fill in the missing files
???<DataSet timestep="200" file="0000200-solution.vtu"/>
?</Collection>
</VTKFile>

when loading this file, paraview will be able to animate the different
timesteps.

You can't yet, but it'd take about five minutes to write a quick converter

for (int i=0; i<N; i++) {
  vtkSmartPointer<vtkDataSetReader> reader =   
vtkSmartPointer<vtkDataSetReader>:::New();
  reader->SetFileName(X);
  vtkSmartPointer<vtkXMLUnstructured/Poly/Image/Writer> writer =   
vtkSmartPointer<vtkXMLUnstructured/Poly/Image/Writer>:::New();
  writer->SetInputConnection(reader->GetOutputPort();
  writer->SetFileName(...)
  write...
end;

and convert them. Then use the file suggested previously.

Subject: [Paraview] Dynamically updating GUI list components
Message-ID: <469F43B0.20901@opencfd.co.uk>

Hi,

I'm updating a reader to ParaView 3.1, and having difficulties getting
the GUI list components to update when new data sets are loaded - i.e.
they remain fixed after the first instance they are populated, instead
of growing/shrinking/changing array name entries etc. The list
components are described by StringVectorProperty entries in the server
manager XML, where each list entry contains a label and a check box, e.g.


        <StringVectorProperty
            name="RegionArrayInfo"
            information_only="1"
            label="Region Arrays">
            <ArraySelectionInformationHelper attribute_name="Region"/>
        </StringVectorProperty>
        <StringVectorProperty
            name="RegionStatus"
            command="SetRegionArrayStatus"
            number_of_elements="0"
            repeat_command="1"
            number_of_elements_per_command="2"
            element_types="2 0"
            information_property="RegionArrayInfo">
            <ArraySelectionDomain name="array_list">
                <RequiredProperties>
                    <Property name="RegionArrayInfo"
                        function="ArrayList"/>
                </RequiredProperties>
            </ArraySelectionDomain>
        </StringVectorProperty>

The 'SetRegionArrayStatus' command simply enables/disables an array. The
properties shown by the list are linked to a vtkDataArraySelection
object. I can add/remove arrays from the object in the C++ code, but the
changes are not shown by the GUI elements... Does anyone have a working
example of using the XML StringVectorProperty component so that it
automatically updates itself based on the current status of the
vtkDataArraySelection object?

Many thanks,

Andy

Hi,

XML VTK file format does support:

- ascii
- raw binary
- base64.

If you use python, I can help you on this.

If you want to write in C, I can help you too, but AFAIK, only VTK CVS 5.1
can let you choose between these three formats.

Hi Stefano,

You can also use raw binary data (as well as Base64 and ASCII). You can take
a look how it's done here

Hi Fred,
I use Fortran, but I know C++ and Python. Therefore if you 
can show a clip of Python code in order to write an "XML 
DataArray" in raw binary format without the "AppendData" 
section I will very happy. The problem is that I don't 
understand how insert raw binary data nested in the 
DataArray tags instead of AppendData tags.
Thank you very much,
Stefano

Subject: [Paraview] HDL import problem
Message-ID: <0EEA6E37C89409D1465A1CFD@[172.29.12.107]>

Dear Paraview users,

I have been given some GPR geophysics data to visualise and use for vector 
extraction in Paraview. The data was put together as parallel transects to 
create a 3D volume with EKKO_3D. It was then imported and saved in T3D as a 
volume HDF and it is saved with an extension .HDL.

I tried to import it into Paraview directly without success. I have also 
been trying to find if there is a way to convert an hdf file into .hd5 but 
have been unsuccessful in the endeavor. T3D can also store data as .raw but 
even in this case I could not find the right translator to import it into 
Paraview.

Could anyone suggest what to do in order to open this dataset in Paraview?

Yours gratefully,

Stefania

Subject: [Paraview] Animating a sequence of exodus files
Message-ID: <46A10AE9.5030201@ucar.edu>

Hi,


I have a sequence of exodus files, each of which has a single time step 
of a mesh in a different refinement state.
I wish to view these files as an animation, so I have named them:
file_000.g
file_001.g
file_002.g
etc...

I was hoping that I could load the first file into paraview and that 
animation would be automatic.  This was the way paraview works with .vtk 
files, anyhow:
file_000.vtk
file_001.vtk, etc...

Do I have to make sure the time step variable in the exodus files has a 
certain sequence, or something like this??

In PV versions <3.0, I could visualize a sequence of data written in 
sequentially numbered vtk files i.e., out_1.vtk,out_2.vtk...out_n.vtk.  
Each set contained data at one instant in time and they were ALL opened 
by selecting the first file in the sequence.  It worked great.

In version 3.0, I can't open the entire sequence by opening the first 
file AND I have not been able to find a way to animate them.  What am I 
missing?  I can't imagine that this functionality is gone but I have 
been reading that a lot has changed in how animation is handled.

Please help.  Thanks.

As far as I know, this animation feature for the .vtk legacy format in
current version is not available. I had a similar problem before. Thus I
opted to write .pvd format pointing .vtu files. It's wonderful. However,
paraview developers promised to retain this features in near future (?).

I was trying to compile ParaView 3.1.0 using the Intel Compiler 9.x on
OS X (Intel) and I got the following link error:

Anyone have any ideas?

Also, if some one can hold my hand I would like to setup a dashboard
for paraview 3 using the Intel C++ compiler to hopefully help catch
some of these errors.

Thanks for any help

Subject: [Paraview] memory limit in vtkDataArray?
Message-ID: <20070723074822.121810@gmx.net>

Hi,
I try to visualize with paraview3 a 3D volume (raw data obtained by x-ray tomography), already thresholded, i.e. voxels of value 0 or 255 only. The file is about 200Mo large, and the dimension in x, y, and z are respectively 574, 828, and 435 pixels.
While applying the filter "contour" at 255 paraview3 crashes, and it seems that the memory limit has been reached.
Anyone has an idea how to solve this problem?

I post the error message for windows and mac intel hereafter.

Many thanks,   Milan

Hi Fred,
thank you very much for your help, but I have a problem to 
download your file: the link give me an error "file don't 
find..."; this problem is due to my Firefox or the link is 
corrupt?
Thanks again!

Hi Clint,

I've attached a tar file with an example reader - it creates simple
client/server side plugins for files with extension '.test'. When you
select 'PVTestReader.test', the code will generate a cube.

The check-box on the properties panel switches between two data sets -
one with five arrays, and the other with ten. The list view on the
properties panel does not get updated, but if you go to the display
panel, you can see that the relevant fields have been generated by
looking at the 'color by' drop down selection.

Thanks,

Andy

Hi,

Quite strange.

I resend it you now.

If it still does not work,
I'll put it on a ftp server.


Cheers,

Subject: [Paraview] Python Wrapping of Custom Source
Message-ID: <b45d6a1e0707230605p5e0ba733t729eed968e1756d9@mail.gmail.com>

I recently created a source object, and have been having troubles accessing
the public methods of the object through the
python scripting interface. The problem seems to be, that only the public
methods that I reference in the xml are being
wrapped. Is there any way to tell the compiler to wripe all the public
methods?

  void SetPoint(double x, double y, double z);  //wrapped
  void SetAllPoints(vtkDoubleArray *cords);  //not wrapped

Subject: [Paraview] memory limit in vtkDataArray?
In-Reply-To: <20070723074822.121810@gmx.net>

There is no set limit on the size of an array in vtkDataArray, although obviously bad things will happen if you run out of system memory.  The array being allocated looks to be about half a gigabyte.  It does not take many of those before a 32 bit machine has no choice but to fail.

It's hard to tell exactly what is eating up all your memory from your description.  The 3D volume you describe is large, but still reasonable to process on a desktop.  However, the things you are doing to it may be requiring more memory than you think.

I'm not sure what you mean by thresholding, but if you are talking about running the data through the threshold filter, that might be a problem.  The threshold filter will convert your structured data to unstructured data.  Unstructured data, of course, is less efficient on how it stores information.  So, unless your threshold has culled a large fraction of the cells, you may have actually increased the amount of data you are storing.  In general, I would recommend not running the threshold filter on your data.

The contour filter is also a bit tricky to predict.  The size of the output contour is heavily dependent on what your data looks like.  It may be that your threshold value is creating a very irregular contour with lots of polygons.  It is especially problematic in noisy data (which is certainly possible from your described data source).  Try using the extract subgrid filter to subsample your data and then run a contour on that to see if it is what you expect.  The answer may be as simple as changing the contour value.

David,

You are using the exodus format in a way that it was not really
intended, and its confusing ParaView.  The exodus format has the concept
of time built into it, and ParaView uses that mechanism to support time.
In addition, it is common for a large parallel simulation to dump out
multiple files, each with a spatial partition of the data.  Thus,
ParaView will assume that your multiple files partition space and not
time.  It will read in the geometry of all the files at once.

Your best bet is to either combine the files into a single using exodus'
built concept of time or to convert the files into a different format.

-Ken

Got about 96% of it built uding QT 4.3.0 however it bombed out with the
following message:

...

Error 1
make[1]: *** [Qt/Components/CMakeFiles/pqComponents.dir/all] Error 2
make: *** [all] Error 2

I am not a QT expert but is anyone working on it for QT 4.3.0? This is
because my linux installation is already using this version. What I am
hoping for is a simple fix that will let this version of QT be used and also
the older versions.

Thanks

Can not really help with the error but I can tell you that I have  
successfully built ParaView 3-1-0 against Qt 4.3.0 on both OS X  
(Intel) and Windows XP (VS 2003.net). Both ParaViews also seem to  
work just fine.
   Kitware does not officially support Qt 4.3 so having it actually  
work is probably luck at this point. The official version of Qt that  
is supported by ParaView is 4.2.3.

Hi Andrew,

We do not yet support Qt 4.3.0. Try using version 4.2.3 instead. Please 
see the following thread from earlier this month discussing this issue: 
http://public.kitware.com/pipermail/paraview/2007-July/005382.html.

Message-ID: <BA212E6DB0B8964CBA5CAADB1E75EB78028DA559@DOVEXC582042.inapps.inergyautomotive.com>

For your information, here is the description of a problem I have when
using link camera.

 

I have two rendering windows, one with only surface datas (triangles)
and the other will fluid data (cells). When I link the two windows, if I
add a scale bar on my walls window, then the cells of my fluid window
become black. If I remove the scale bar the colours show up again.

 

Doing the same thing but with two windows with surface walls on both of
them the field colours are well represented on both windows during
linking (no problem occur)

 

Can it be a bug or from my filters ??

I should add that the version is Paraview 3.1.0 Dev.

 

And a solution of this problem is to add a scale bar on the second
window (i.e the problem does not appear if both rendering windows have
scale bars)

Luc,

 

I have never seen this bug, and from your description I still don't know
how to replicate it.  Could you give a more step-by-step description on
how to replicate this bug, preferably with data and filters that we have
access to?

    -DQT_UIC_EXECUTABLE:FILEPATH=stuff'
 
Qt is just built as follows:
cd to your source directory
./configure --prefix='instillation directory'
make
make install
 
When we make an XP build, we just set the QT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE, and the rest automagically works.

Got about 96% of it built uding QT 4.3.0 however it bombed out with the following message:

I am not a QT expert but is anyone working on it for QT 4.3.0? This is because my linux installation is already using this version. What I am hoping for is a simple fix that will let this version of QT be used and also the older versions.

Hi all

I generated build files at CMake and openned Visual C++ 2005 Express
Edition. When I selected the solution "ParaView", iniside the directory
CMake built the binaries,  Visual Studio openned 113 projects but I could
not see the project regarding to my reader. Was I supposed to have the new
reader?s project ? Or I just need to build the ALL_BUILD project?

Thanks

Your reader sources got put into the "pvfilters" project. Compile the
"ALL_BUILD" project and see if your reader shows up when you run
paraview.

Subject: [Paraview] Intel Compiler errors out with libXML2 [PV310]
Message-ID: <43a689850707241415y59c6afebw4e23142a7f2ff30e@mail.gmail.com>

I am trying to build ParaView 3-1-0 using the Intel Compiler (Vers
9.x) on OS X (intel) 10.4.10. During linking I get the following
error:

Linking C shared library ../../../bin/libvtklibxml2.dylib
xilibtool: executing 'libtool'
ld: Undefined symbols:
___signbit
libtool: internal link edit command failed
make[2]: *** [bin/libvtklibxml2.pv3.1.dylib] Error 1
make[1]: *** [VTK/Utilities/vtklibxml2/CMakeFiles/vtklibxml2.dir/all] Error 2
make: *** [all] Error 2

This otherwise compiles fine with the gcc included with OS X. Out of
curiosity I downloaded LibXML2 version 2..6.27 (of which the ParaView
version is based off) and successfully compiled and tested it using
the Intel Compiler.

I am now guess that something went wrong when the LibXML2 sources were
changed to work with CMake/VTK/ParaView.

Anyone have any idea? I grepped the sources for "signbit" and the only
close matches were in the "trio" sources, which are NOT compiled by
default. I did find one reference to "signbit" in the compiled object
file xpath.o. I looked through some of the sources of xpath.c/h and
some of those includes but nothing obvious popped out at me.

Any help would be appreciated.

In the 3.10 development version how can I reset

I found the (rather hidden) center setting in the 
Edit->Settings->Annotation but would like to be 
able to pick my geometry.

Hi

I have created a *.pvd xml file which loads timestep and *.vtu file data 
into paraview.
 From paraview i can then save the animation to a *.avi file nicely. I 
could also create a python script which loads the *.pvd file and brings 
me to the state before saving it as an animation. But I do not know how 
to save the animation from the script. What do I have to apply to the 
python script?

Regards and thanx for helping!

You'll have to create a "vtkSMAnimationSceneImageWriter" object to write 
an animation out. This is not a proxy. So simply create the writer 
object, set properties such as "FrameRate", "FileName", "Magnification" 
on it. Also set the "AnimationScene" to point to the animation scene 
proxy, and the call "Save". That should write the animation out.

Oh that's nice of Qt 4.3 to report a compile error for that incorrect usage of 
qobject_cast.  In 4.2, that'll result in undesired runtime behavior.  It'll 
be fixed regardless.

To clarify any misconceptions about the Qt api.  Qt 4.3 is binary and source 
compatible with 4.2, 4.1 and 4.0.  And 4.2 with 4.1 and 4.0.

But you're still on your own when dealing with Qt bugs in versions we don't 
officially support (I've only seen these issues in 4.2.0 and 4.2.1).

xpath.c includes "trionan.c", which in turn includes triodef.h and trionan.h
That's how xpath.o gets it.

So when you use diff, what changes were made to the code when put into VTK?
vtk_README.txt indicates some things were changed in the trio*.h files, but 
doesn't say what.

I think you want to have the array selection list update when the check box is 
checked/unchecked and before accept is pressed.
In that case, you'll have to write your own GUI side panel to allow that kind 
of interaction.  You can follow how pqXDMFPanel.cxx does it.

There's a helper proxy that interacts with the reader behind the scenes, and 
updates the GUI with new options as other options are changed.  When the 
accept button is pressed the new values are put onto the proxy itself.  It is 
done this way to work properly with the new undo/redo framework.

Or did you only care that the new array selections update after you hit 
accept?  Then you can change them, and hit accept again.  In that case, we'll 
have to fix some ParaView code to make that work.

In your example code, you copied the *.xml files into the plugin directory.
The xml files are embedded into the plugins, so there is no need to do that.  
In fact, they are ignored anyways.

That feature is not yet implemented.  It is addressed in bug #3875
(http://www.paraview.org/Bug/bug.php?op=show&bugid=3875&pos=0).  That
feature was put off because it is a little tricky to implement and
generally not used all that often (this is the first time it has been
brought up).

Thanks Clint,
   I realize that I am on my own with it. It just surprised me that this error appeared. I did suspect that it was something more fundamental relating to the ParaView code. I am not a QT expert so I dreaded looking for the cause!

   As I said it just came about because I did a dist-upgrade on my machine and this version of QT was installed.

    Andrew

Oh that's nice of Qt 4.3 to report a compile error for that incorrect usage of 
qobject_cast.  In 4.2, that'll result in undesired runtime behavior.  It'll 
be fixed regardless.

To clarify any misconceptions about the Qt api.  Qt 4.3 is binary and source 
compatible with 4.2, 4.1 and 4.0.  And 4.2 with 4.1 and 4.0.

But you're still on your own when dealing with Qt bugs in versions we don't 
officially support (I've only seen these issues in 4.2.0 and 4.2.1).

Hi Clint,

Thanks for taking a look.

It's the second option that i'm interested in - to only update the
selections when the accept button is pressed. The check box just seemed
an easy mechanism to switch between datasets for the example...

Would it be possible to make these changes to the ParaView code as you
suggest?

Andy

Thanks for the answer Ken.

Picking center of rotation is important to me. And 
I can't be the only one who wants to spin their 
dataset around a point which isn't the center of 
the dataset?

Is there a workaround? Something like picking 
('p') a Probe, writing down the location and 
entering it in the 
Edit->Settings->Annotation->Center_of_rotation?

Regards,

Mattijs

I need to do this quite often as well and I've pretty much been using the 
workaround you describe below, although as you say it isn't very convenient.

OK.  I bumped up the priority of bug #3875 and added a new bug (#5419)
to request making it easier to set the center of rotation coordinates.

To the Developers in particular,

When I have a large, complex (e.g., large number of finite elements, 30 
parts/materials), I find myself selecting one or two parts/materials and 
zooming in tight to see what I can learn from the results. I find that 
being able to select/pick the center of rotation to be the point of 
interest very very helpful if not essential to getting the insight I want.

As I am writing this, ParaView mail arrives from Ken Moreland saying the 
priority on completing this feature just went up -- I am pleased to add 
my vote to the boost in priority.

Thanks all for a great tool!

Subject: [Paraview] [PV 3.0.2] Error loading parallel data
Message-ID: <20070727183838.2680A727DA@mailhost.nacad.ufrj.br>


Hi folks,

I've got the following error message after trying to load a parallel data in
a client-server configuration (reverse connection mode).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------
ERROR: In
c:\berk\work\ReleaseBuilds\ParaView3\Servers\Common\vtkPVDataInformation.cxx
line 974
vtkPVDataInformation (085EF4D8): Error parsing bounds.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------

I thought this problem were due to the data format I used (Ensight
server-of-server) but I also tried with a pvd file created using PV-2.2.1
running in parallel. Am I doing anything wrong or such feature is still
being developed in PV 3.0.2?

Further details about my try:

-- pvserver 3.0.2 compiled in a SGI Altix system with shared library and
mesa library version 6.2.1;
-- cmake 2.4.7;
-- pvclient 3.0.2 official binary distribution;
-- Client to server conection working fine (at least, I guess so since I can
list my remote home after connected).

Sounds like a bug. Can you open the same data with an older paraview
version? Can you give us an example dataset?

Just to follow up with this.. evidently 'signbit(...)' is implemented  
as an actual function in the 'imf' library that intel includes with  
their compiler where as in GCC it is implemented as a macro.  
Supposedly icc/icpc should be automatically linking against libimf  
but for some reason is not, at least not on my system. There is also  
a preprocessor constant '__PURE_SYS_C99_HEADERS__' that if defined  
will NOT use the intel supplied definitions and instead use the gcc  
definitions. By setting this I can get the xpath.c to compile.. and  
probably link at that point.

   I have submitted a request to intel to explain what I might be  
doing wrong so hopefully this can get worked out. For now I am going  
to just define __PURE_SYS_C99_HEADERS__ and see if I can get the rest  
of ParaView 3.1.0 to compile using icc/icpc.

Hi David, 
 
I'm not sure if it would help you but here in my lab we have implemented a
very simple program to convert our Ensight files to the VTK/XML based
formats. I've put the program available here
http://www.nacad.ufrj.br/~rnelias/paraview/ens2vtk-rev0.zip. It is a very
naive program and was not sufficiently tested yet but it worked fine with
our preliminary tests. Feel free to contact us or send any improvements,
bugs, fix, etc..
 
You'll need VTK library to compile it and cmake can help you to build the
compilation environments
 
Regards
 
Renato.

	I know when I worked with Sierra (at Sandia) we would write a new

the ensight8 tool automatically would read the suite of files and automate

No, the 1st signature is correct. The 1st argument is the number of 
points in the cell, and the next is an array of vtkIdType. If vtkIdList* 
was used instead, there would be no need for the 1st argument since 
vtkIdList has a GetNumberOfIds() method.
