Subject: [Paraview] Color Map Editor garbled display on macOS
Message-ID: <3B62F441-82AC-48BD-9A3F-96CF94825753@bluequartz.net>

I have a macOS 10.10.5 machine with a sapphire AMD 7950 video card and when I launch ParaView and try to use the Color Map Editor it is all garbled and messed up. I think early versions of ParaView 5.1 and 5.2 were OK but I can't remember. I tried 5.4.1 on a macOS 10.12.x MacBook Pro with NVidia 750M GPU and it shows up fine.

I'll this same machine under macOS 10.12 (Sierra) and see if it is an OS version issue and report back.

I think you might be able to use the ?Clip? filter instead, with the Clip Type set to Scalar. Instead of giving you an isosurface, this will give you the region bounded by an isosurface.

Thanks,

    I'm not sure if there is an automated way to do this. My idea is to

    However, I'm unsure how I can accomplish this as I don't see a filter 
    that offers functionality like this as it would rely on two input: the

    Any advice on this would be greatly appreciated.

Follow up: Same machine running macOS 10.12.x (Sierra) does NOT show the problem. So something odd with the macOS 10.10 (Yosemite) AMD Driver is my guess.

Thanks for the help! That worked like a charm.

One more question: after I extracted my point of maximum via a 
programmable filter, I have a PolyData of 1 point only. Is there a way 
to display this point in the 3D render view? I can't seem to get the 
point to render via a Geometric Representation.

Thanks,

Dear All:

I have tried to install the new version of

Subject: [Paraview] loading multiple state-files without hiding and
 resetting already loaded objects
Message-ID: <fc803504-8b2e-a854-ab34-a23fe09a8e81@mh-hannover.de>

Dear mailing list members,


It seems that PV (and paraview.simple.LoadState) by default hides already loaded 
objects (and resets e.g. their coloring) when another state-file is loaded.
Is there a way to load multiple state-files after one another without hiding and 
resetting already existent objects? I.e. a way to concatenate multiple 
state-files and leave their objects in the state as they got loaded (e.g. 
colored, hidden/visible)?
I do understand that loading a new state-file will reset the camera, but not the 
rest.
Here's my initial attempt to achieve this with pvpython:
https://github.com/romangrothausmann/ParaView_scripts/blob/90eb4ca8499070bed941d50b89ebea82fd6a9e23/pvsm-multi.py

Any help or hints are very much appreciated
Roman

Subject: [Paraview] Subdomain
Message-ID: <CA+E_iNNP59jsdnvha+Zxi6G6hZmGQtf2DX+OvMUpgzPYMKOo1w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

I have posted this question some days ago but could not get any answer. Now
I am trying to explain it more.

I am using open source software LIGGGHTS, which uses DEM (discrete element
method), My simulation contains a cylinder and 4 bladed impeller which
rotates inside the cylinder. I have inserted 3 types of particles in the
cylinder and rotate the impeller which causes mixing of particles that
process is done using LIGGGHTS software.

Now for post processing, i am using ParaView. In Paraview, I can see the
particles mixed each other. but I want to find out the mixing status for
that purpose I want to use Subdomain based mixing index (SMI).

For SMI calculation, it requires dividing the domain into subdomains like
3D mesh and to find the total number of particles and number of particles
of each type in each cell of mesh/subdomain.

Please let me know how can I create these subdomains in ParaView?

Hello all,

Does anyone know of a way to draw an arrow attached to the view rather 
than the 3D arrow source? The use of this is to point at a particular

Does this functionality exist in Paraview?

Dear all,

I'm very happy to meet all of you in this society.

I use a finite element software with multiprocessors(40) to solve problems.

All the .vtu files. associated with each processor are output and then a
file .pvtu is generated.

The original file is displayed perfectly as shown in bone.png.  However,
when I try to cut it with a plane, it occurs the following issue as
clip.png, It seems not be displayed correctly.

Would you please tell me what happened to my data?

Hi,

This typically happens when ghost cells are marked improperly or the data
set has a node/point partitioning and no cells to bridge between the
subdomains (though the point partitioning issue usually happens with finite
difference simulations instead of FEM simulations). If you could share your
dataset it would be easier to diagnose.

Best,
Andy

Dear Paraview List,

I'm trying to read some HDF files, which contain dense voxel data. In my
calculations, I write out the HDF and wrapper XDMF data to store
timestep and other metadata.

This all works fine, until I want to have 2 different voxel sizes at 2
different timesteps (different number of voxels in each dimension).

When loading up the data as a series of time-steps, everything works
until I reach the first set of data from the new size. When loading the
data, the values in the voxels seem to become invalid, and the bounding
box around the data starts moving in the direction of (1,1,1).

I can load each timestep individually correctly, it is just when I try
to load the entire timeseries that it fails.

Does anyone know a solution for this? I have raw voxel grids in the
program that generates the data, so I need to wrap them in something to
provide a timestep. I'd rather avoid having to interface with VTK, as
the code I am working on does not have a VTK dependency - I'm just
post-processing with paraview.

I'm opening the series via:
File->Open, then select the tree item data-..xmdf

each file is written as:

data-1.hdf.xmdf
data-2.hdf.xmdf
....

The XMDF files contain something like this

Put the co-rect-mesh (image data) inside a grid collection (multiblock).

Paraview's pipeline doesn't deal well with image data that changes
dimensions over time. This is not limited to xdmf. When inside a
multiblock, a different pipeline layer takes over and it works out.

Please reply-all to keep the mailing list on the thread so everyone can
contribute to the discussion and benefit from it.

To make a multiblock from xdmf, enclose your grid inside of an
xdmfgridcollection like so:
<Xdmf>
  <Domain Name="Data">
     <Grid GridType="Collection" CollectionType="Spatial">
        <Grid ... your existing temporal grid here >
     </Grid>
  </Domain>
</Xdmf>

Hi,

It seems recent releases of the OpenFOAM reader have modified the interface such that a mesh MUST be present in the constant/polyMesh folder (at least since 5.3).

In the past, the reader would also work with a mesh in the zero-time folder. Is there any reason for this change? Having the mesh in the 0-time folder is part of the current OpenFOAM interface standard. Removing this support reduces compatibility.

Thanks for your feedback.

Hi,

I am attempting to build Paraview 5.4.1 from source using VTK_PYTHON_VERSION = 3 with the aim of making use of paraview automation using python 3.  However I am running into trouble because the qt version does not meet the minimum of version 5.6.  Also the Qt5_DIR is not found.

I am attempting the build using Cmake 3.5.1 on Ubuntu 16.04.
Ubuntu 16.04 is supplied with qt5.5.1 but I cannot update this.

Please can you provide me with some advice and preferably step-by-step instructions on how to complete this build.

Many thanks,
Joel

Dear David,

Thanks very much for the help - this does indeed work if I use a spatial
grid collectiontype.

However if I change this to a temporal type (whether or not I include
<Time Value="x" /> in each sub-grid), then I do not end up with a
frame-by-frame animation, as I was hoping for. I simply end up with the
first grid shown, and the rest do not contain any data - there is only
one frame shown globally.

Does paraview support CollectionType="Temporal"? [1]. If it is
important, I am using paraview 5.4.0


Thanks!

Try putting the spatial collection inside the temporal one. Promote <Time=
Value="x"/> to the spatial collection.

<Xdmf>

Hi David,

Thanks for the very rapid response. This does indeed work.

I initially had troubles - it does not work under the XDMF reader, if
the voxel sizes are of unequal dimension. I had to select XDMF3 to
succesfully load the data.

Thanks very much for your help!

For any future readers, I had this inside the temporal collection:
<Grid GridType="Collection" CollectionType="Temporal">
	...

	<!-- nth grid-->
     <Grid GridType="Collection" CollectionType="Spatial">

                <Time Value="4"/>
                <Grid Name="Data" GridType="Uniform">
                <Topology TopologyType="3DCORECTMesh" Dimensions="31 31
31"/>
                <Geometry GeometryType="ORIGIN_DXDYDZ">
                <DataItem Name="Origin" Dimensions="3"
NumberType="Float" Precision="4" Format="XML">-0.6 -0.6 -0.6</DataItem>
                <DataItem Name="Spacing" Dimensions="3"
NumberType="Float" Precision="4" Format="XML">0.04 0.04 0.04</DataItem>
                </Geometry>
                <Attribute Name="second 0" AttributeType="Scalar"
Center="Node">
                <DataItem Format="HDF" NumberType="Float" Precision="4"
Dimensions="31 31 31">ls-84.hdf:/voxels</DataItem></Attribute>
                </Grid>
        </Grid>
</Grid>

Hi,

Please respond to the entire mailing list so that anyone that wants to
participate or follow along can.

I think the issue here is that you have the same cell specified in multiple
vtu files and ParaView is getting confused when trying to render them.
These are the overlapping cells at the subdomain boundary. My
recommendation would be to either mark these repeated cells as ghost cells
(see https://blog.kitware.com/ghost-and-blanking-visibility-changes/ for
information on that). Other than that, you could use the Clean to Grid
filter to get rid of coincident points and then use the Clean Cells to Grid
filter to get rid of extra copies of the cell.

Cheers,
Andy

Joel,
You can install Qt 5.6 from the web and make sure you you set
Qt5_DIR=/opt/Qt/5.6/gcc_64/lib/cmake/Qt5
(the dir containing Qt5Config.cmake)
when you build ParaView

HTH,
Dan

Dear all,

Thanks for your suggestions. It is exactly what you said.

Marking ghost cell would be non-trival work and I tried the second idea.
But only cell and points information is left, other field information
associated with points seem to be lost. Is that the case? If that is the
case, is there an easy way to attach point data to points again?

BTW, I searched the internet and found that the D3 filter could be a good
option for my unstructured grid information. But I cannot find the D3
filter as Filters>Alphabetical>D3. So my second question is how to add D3
filter to my paraview?

Subject: [Paraview] OSPRay Surface Opacity
Message-ID: <DF9B9102-80C5-492F-B4D1-3EA46C716072@gmail.com>

Good morning,
I am running ParaView 5.4.1-Qt5-OpenGL2-Windows-64bit and I was wondering if there is a way to activate the opacity rendering while using OSPRay ambient occlusion

In the OSPRay website I have found this:
"New SciVis renderer parameter aoTransparencyEnabled, controlling whether object transparency is respected when computing ambient occlusion (disabled by default, as it is considerable slower)"

However I am not sure how to change that parameter in ParaView

Thanks
SC

A couple of observations:

1) for surface rendering with color mapped array, vtk's OSPRay interface we
does not yet respect transparency (either at the actor level or in the
alpha channel of the colormap). If you use a solid color for the entire
actor (PV GUI color choice is "Solid Color" instead of one of the arrays in
the data) then we do respect opacity.

2) we turn on aoTransparencyEnabled whenever there are volumes in the scene
https://gitlab.kitware.com/vtk/vtk/blob/master/Rendering/OSPRay/vtkOSPRayRendererNode.cxx#L870
If your scene doesn't have volumes in it, then you'll need to compile from
source and enable that generally (remove the if conditon).

Feel free to submit patches or bug reports to for either of those things to
help us remember to improve them.

Hi David,
thanks for the quick reply.

I can confirm opacity changes work if I set the actor representation to
Solid Color.

It would be great if the new release could have the aoTransparencyEnabled
flag as something that can be switch on and off using a tick


Kind Regards

Muhammad ,

You can try the Clip filter to generate box-shaped subdomains.
Counting the number of particles in each cell is a little more
complicated. Off the top of my head, I can't think of a filter that
does that for you. But, you could write a Programmable Filter that
does this. Briefly, the Programmable Filter would:

1. Set up a vtkCellLocator and give it the input to the Programmable
Filter (which is assumed to be a subdomain you've created with the
Clip filter)

2. Create a cell vtkDataArray (e.g., vtkIntArray) to store the counts
of particles falling inside each cell. The array should have the same
number of tuples as cells in the subdomain.

3. Iterate through all the points in a second input given to the
Programmable Filter. For each point, find the cell containing the
point using vtkCellLocator::FindCell(). Increment the count in the
cell array you created in step 2 given the cell ID returned by the
vtkCellLocator::FindCell() method.

There is a lot of information about the Programmable Filter in the
ParaView Guide and at
https://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Python_Programmable_Filter.

Hope that helps,
Cory

Hi lists,

We've been working lately to expose OSPRay's path traced lights and
materials inside VTK and ParaView. I'd like to make some snazzy
photorealistic images and movies now and post them on the website, at
conferences  and in press releases.

Unsurprisingly the images I can make out of vtkSphereSource and the like,
are not all that compelling. That's why I'm reaching out to see if anyone
has some great looking, real world, data that I might work with.

I am thinking something like a car with lots of glass and metal and rubber
would be ideal - especially if the data also had some interesting attribute
data on it that I could colormap at the same time. I'm more than happy to
attribute the data however you like.

Feel free to contact me off-list if you like.

thanks

Thanks for the references Bill.

My backup plan is to find a suitably licensed model of a car from one of
the sites like free3d, but I'm hoping for something more "real world" from
someone's day to day work out there.

Hi,

You can remap the point variables back onto the points using the Resample
with Dataset filter but that won't work for cell data.

I believe that the D3 filter is only available if you have ParaView
built/installed with MPI. Even then it will only work if you're running
with more than a single MPI process.

I still suggest writing out the data with either marking the repeated cells
as ghost cells or not including them in the file as any other thing you do
to get around that can become fairly expensive and manually intensive as
you go to bigger datasets.

Dear Andy,

Thanks very much.

You can remap the point variables back onto the points using the Resample
> with Dataset filter but that won't work for cell data.

I tried the method you advised. Assuming that the original file name is A
and the file after Clean to Grid and Clean Cells to Grid is B, I tried two
different options for the source for Resample with DataSets and both A and
B are not working.  Do I misunderstand something?

I believe that the D3 filter is only available if you have ParaView

I only use serial paraview to process multi-results generated by other
programs.  I don't use the parallel paraview to deal with large datasets so
I think D3 filter is not suitable for me.


I still suggest writing out the data with either marking the repeated cells
> as ghost cells or not including them in the file as any other thing you do

I would try to not include repeated cells in the original output file. But
how to mark the repeated cells as ghost cells? I think there should a
vtu/pvtu file format to describe it but I didn't find it on the internet.
Could you please share it to me?

BTW,  when I clip a small model with 6700 elements generated by 40
processors, it looks fine. So my question: is there a limit to deal with
the large dataset for paraview?

I think you would be better off running your script with

./pvpython <name of script>

pvpython comes with the ParaView binary and is located in the same
directory as the 'paraview' executable. pvpython uses the same Python
as ParaView is, so compatibility with some local Python on your system
is not a problem. Further, pvpython sets up Python environment to
provide access to the ParaView and VTK Python modules without having
to set up any environment variables.

python3 definitely won't work with the official ParaView binaries,
which are built against Python 2.7.

Can you try something out:
1. Download https://www.paraview.org/files/dependencies/mesa-opengl-win64.zip
2. Put all the dlls in the same location as paraview.exe (or in your
PATH) and then start ParaView

Does that work? This should use  software rendering via Mesa3D and
avoid any driver issues we may be running into.

Subject: [Paraview] paraview display issue on parallel files
Message-ID: <33cef21a7ab34e4c8d545c35f6f18705@ES08AMSNLNT.srn.sandia.gov>

Rilin,

I think I found a solution for you that will work at least most of the time. The solution is to simply write out .vtm files instead of .pvtu files. vtm, which is the multiblock file format, is similar to the pvt* format. The main difference is that when VTK reads in vtm files it keeps the data from different files in different blocks, and that will prevent ParaView from removing what it thinks are internal faces. I?ve attached an example vtkm file to this email.

A bit more explanation and a description of where this will fail. As Andy said the problem is that the files in your dataset have overlapping cells. When ParaView reads in a pvtu file, it combines all the cells from all files into a single mesh, and this mesh will have duplicates of the overlapping cells. By definition, these overlapping cells will share all of their faces. ParaView?s external faces algorithm assumes that if two cells have the same face, that face must be internal and can be removed (which is true in conforming meshes but not when there are duplicate cells). When you first load your mesh into ParaView, everything seems to be working fine because the reader is also creating duplicate points so index-wise the duplicate cells register as different. But many operations (like merge cells, clip, and D3) will find coincident points and merge them together. That?s when ParaView removes all the faces of all duplicate cells.

When ParaView reads the vtm file, it keeps the data from each file in a separate mesh. When ParaView runs algorithms like external faces, it does so independently from each other. So even if the cells are sharing faces, they will be across blocks and will still be considered external. The multiblock structure should remain intact as long as you don?t run a filter that merges them together like D3 or Merge Blocks.

Hope that helps.

-Ken

Dear Andy,

Thanks very much.

You can remap the point variables back onto the points using the Resample with Dataset filter but that won't work for cell data.
I tried the method you advised. Assuming that the original file name is A and the file after Clean to Grid and Clean Cells to Grid is B, I tried two different options for the source for Resample with DataSets and both A and B are not working.  Do I misunderstand something?

I believe that the D3 filter is only available if you have ParaView built/installed with MPI. Even then it will only work if you're running with more than a single MPI process.
I only use serial paraview to process multi-results generated by other programs.  I don't use the parallel paraview to deal with large datasets so I think D3 filter is not suitable for me.


I still suggest writing out the data with either marking the repeated cells as ghost cells or not including them in the file as any other thing you do to get around that can become fairly expensive and manually intensive as you go to bigger datasets.
I would try to not include repeated cells in the original output file. But how to mark the repeated cells as ghost cells? I think there should a vtu/pvtu file format to describe it but I didn't find it on the internet. Could you please share it to me?

BTW,  when I clip a small model with 6700 elements generated by 40 processors, it looks fine. So my question: is there a limit to deal with the large dataset for paraview?

Dear all,

Thanks for your suggestions. It is exactly what you said.

Marking ghost cell would be non-trival work and I tried the second idea.  But only cell and points information is left, other field information associated with points seem to be lost. Is that the case? If that is the case, is there an easy way to attach point data to points again?

BTW, I searched the internet and found that the D3 filter could be a good option for my unstructured grid information. But I cannot find the D3 filter as Filters>Alphabetical>D3. So my second question is how to add D3 filter to my paraview?

Hi,
Please respond to the entire mailing list so that anyone that wants to participate or follow along can.
I think the issue here is that you have the same cell specified in multiple vtu files and ParaView is getting confused when trying to render them. These are the overlapping cells at the subdomain boundary. My recommendation would be to either mark these repeated cells as ghost cells (see https://blog.kitware.com/ghost-and-blanking-visibility-changes/ for information on that). Other than that, you could use the Clean to Grid filter to get rid of coincident points and then use the Clean Cells to Grid filter to get rid of extra copies of the cell.
Cheers,
Andy

Hi,
This typically happens when ghost cells are marked improperly or the data set has a node/point partitioning and no cells to bridge between the subdomains (though the point partitioning issue usually happens with finite difference simulations instead of FEM simulations). If you could share your dataset it would be easier to diagnose.
Best,
Andy

Dear all,

I'm very happy to meet all of you in this society.

I use a finite element software with multiprocessors(40) to solve problems.

All the .vtu files. associated with each processor are output and then a file .pvtu is generated.

The original file is displayed perfectly as shown in bone.png.  However, when I try to cut it with a plane, it occurs the following issue as clip.png, It seems not be displayed correctly.

Would you please tell me what happened to my data?

Message-ID: <10A03274360DCF47A6EE78C9952A31CA91F5915B@UCOLHPUD.easf.csd.disa.mil>

Hello,

Has anyone managed to use ParaView 5.4.x with more than 64 core 
on a single node when running in client/server moder.

Thanks,

Joe

Subject: [Paraview] Problems with mpi4py and SGI's mpt 2.14 and 2.15
	versions of MPI
Message-ID: <10A03274360DCF47A6EE78C9952A31CA91F59198@UCOLHPUD.easf.csd.disa.mil>

Hello,

I have been running into problems with
mpi4py and SGI's mpt 2.14 and 2.15  versions of MPI
while compiling ParaView 5.3.0 on HPC systems.

mpi4py cannot find MPI_CONVERSION_FN_NULL
when compiling mpi4py.MPI.c

MPI_CONVERSION_FN_NULL was not used by the
version of mpi4py that came with ParaView 5.2.0
and when I swap the ParaView 5.2.0 version of mpi4py
in place of the ParaView 5.3.0 , 5.4.0 or 5.4.1 versions of mpi4py then
ParaView 5.3.0, 5.4.0 and 5.4.1 (with the 5.2.0 version of mpi4py)
compile just fine.

Has anyone found a better solution to this issue?

Thanks,

Joe

Dear Kenneth and Andy,

Thanks so much.

This works fine. It is truly the simplest way for me to post-processing the
data.  In this way, almost all the serial algorithm can be applied to
multi-files.

Thanks again for your kind help.

Best regards.

Antonio,

I'm adding back Utkarsh, who pointed you to the mesa libraries. Please
also reply to the mailing list so that others may benefit from and
contribute to the discussion.

What kind of graphics hardware do you have on that machine?

Thanks,
Cory

James,

I just tested this on ParaView 5.4.1 and could not reproduce it. My
file series is:

Sphere0001.vtk
Sphere0002.vtk
Sphere0003.vtk

Could you try loading these files, which are attached in a .zip file?

Thanks,
Cory

A student in a ParaView course I just taught had a regular Surface
(not Surface Book) and had no problem running ParaView on it.

Xavier,

The runtime error is troubling. I suspect there may be a problem or
incompatibility with a shared library on your system.

If you wanted to debug further, you could try downloading Dependency Walker
[1] and load paraview.exe with it. It should show you the DLLs ParaView is
trying to load. I wonder if ParaView is trying to load a Python other than
the one it ships with?

HTH,
Cory

Message-ID: <878ebb62-470c-7037-3f9f-e23818eca959@shuhaowu.com>

Hello,

I would like to create a dialog box for my macro that takes a screenshot 
for each timestep. I want to be able to specify a file name prefix and 
the number of timesteps to screenshot. I can't figure out how to import 
PyQT (tried import PyQt4, PyQt5, PySide). Am I doing something wrong?

Thanks,
Shuhao

None of those packages are including in standard ParaView
distribution.  (PyQt5 could have been included but we can't because of
licensing issues).

Hi Roman,

It turns out ParaView was not designed for this use case because of
certain difficulties discussed here:

https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/issues/17442

In your Python script, you could manually cash all the properties of
the existing representations and restore them after loading the most
recent state file.

The functions

reprs = GetRepresentations()
repr = reprs.values()[0]
props = repr.ListProperties()
GetProperty(repr, props[0])

would be helpful for this.

Cory,

Thanks for taking a look. Your files did indeed load as expected.

It appears I was a bit hasty in my prior email. The naming scheme I use is
actually fileXXXX_stress.vtk with X the step number. The "_stress" denotes
that I'm visualizing the stress (I sometimes output different data that
doesn't really make sense within a single output file).

Looking at the wiki, this is not, technically speaking, a valid naming
convention for animation of legacy vtk files. In my defense though, it does
work on versions of paraview prior to 5.4.

It appears that the logic for detecting series data is now more strict,
breaking my workflow. I'm guessing that fixing the naming convention to fit
within the accepted patterns is the best solution.

James

Subject: [Paraview] Opacity editor with log scale
Message-ID: <41830669-0E4B-429B-ADB9-FB3C8F8B95DF@ornl.gov>

Hi,

I noticed that when ?Use log scale when mapping data to colors? is selected, the color opacity editor isn?t being rescaled to reflect this. In the attached screenshot only the red portion of the color map is visible in the editor, suggesting the x axis remains linear. In contrast, the color legend rescales so that while the values change, colors stay the same.

Would it be more intuitive for the opacity editor to behave more like the color legend? Or is keeping the color map linear in the opacity editor by design?

Best,
Steven

Hi,

I have a question about saving animation. I find that when I try to save the animation, the main model only occupies a small space. The background will occupy a large space. I wonder how can I save the animation to make sure not only the whole main body will show in the video, but also the background area is very small.

Thanks!

Subject: [Paraview] Read files in different folders at the same time
Message-ID: <CAMd10VYaJDGv6J_-MQ2cQ+GVnBOHO3d1eMntdwtiCofzt=X65g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

When I do the simulation, I restart the computation and as a result there
are files generated in different folders but with sequential vtu file
names. For example, in the first folder we have vtu files numbered from 0
to 100, and in the second folder we have vtu files from 101 to 200. I
wonder if there is a convenient way to animate all these 200 files in one
setup, without copy them into the same folder?

Thanks.

I am afraid that's not possible currently. A workaround is to create a
pvd file as follows:

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<VTKFile type="Collection" version="0.1" byte_order="LittleEndian"
header_type="UInt32" compressor="vtkZLibDataCompressor">
  <Collection>
    <DataSet timestep="0"  file="dir1/file0.vtu"/>
    <DataSet timestep="1"  file="dir1/file1.vtu"/>
    ....
    <DataSet timestep="101"  file="dir2/file0.vtu"/>
    ....
  </Collection>
</VTKFile>

Make sure that header matches the header in one of the vtu files.

Subject: [Paraview] Question about animation background size

Does your current window size and target image size for the animation
differ in aspect ratio? That's one reason why animation view may not
match your expectation. With ParaView 5.5, there will be a "Preview"
mode which allow you to set up your viz to match the target aspect
(see https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/merge_requests/1733).
With 5.4 and earlier, you can use "Tools | Lock View Size Custom" to
lock the view size to an aspect ratio matching your target resolution
and then zoom in/out as needed to ensure a better fit.

Steven,

That's done so because the opacity mapping doesn't support log scale yet.

Antonio,

Do you happen to have an integrated graphics chip on your laptop? I
wonder if ParaView is set to use integrated graphics rather than your
NVIDIA card and isn't liking what it finds. You can try going to the
NVIDIA control panel. Under 3D Settings in the panel on the left,
click on "Manage 3D settings". On the right side, click on the "Global
Settings" tab. Make sure "High-performance NVIDIA processor" is
selected. Apply the changes, then run ParaView again to see if the
problem is resolved.

Cory:

I am sorry, but I am still getting the same error message.

I fear that there might something wrong then with my system if other
paraview user using windows do not have problems.

I will try to download and install paraview on another computer and
let you know.
I am sorry for all the inconveniences I am causing.

Many thanks for your time and attention.

Kind regards

Antonio

Antonio,

No worries! We do run into issues from time to time on other Windows
machines, so we are happy to help you work through the kinks so that
we can understand the potential issues out there.

One other thing to look for:

 See if you have a different Qt installation on your system whose path
is in your PATH environment variable. To check, click on the
Start/Windows menu. Type in "environment" and select "Edit the system
environment variables". In the System Properties dialog that shows up,
click on the "Environment Variables..." button on the bottom right.
This brings up an Environment Variables dialog with user variables in
the top panel and system variables in the bottom panel. Look at the
Path variables and see if there is a location listed with "Qt" in the
name, or if you have a program that might use its own Qt.

Also look to see if an environment variable named QT_PLUGIN_PATH is
set. If it is set, it will confuse ParaView as it loads Qt and it
might result in this error. We have seen this in one other Windows
machine.

Best regards,
Cory

Not seeing anything with Qt is a good thing in that it means some
other software installed on your system is not interfering with
ParaView's operation. That bad news is that I'm out of ideas on what
might be causing your problem.

Maybe a graphics card driver update would help?

Message-ID: <7E8CD3CE-D443-4C90-93A3-6F66D343A084@sandia.gov>

An easier but equally unsatisfactory solution is to do an ?ln -s? command to create symbolic links in a common directory. It?s technically not a copy of the file and ParaView will pick them up as if they were the regular file.

Evan,

I have filed a bug report [1]. I don't recall if this was an
intentional change, but it appears to be causing you and at least one
other person problems.

Thanks,
Cory

Subject: [Paraview] SelectInputVector attribute in the SurfaceLIC plugin
Message-ID: <1505139407649.93980@epfl.ch>

Dear Paraviewers,


I'm trying to use the SurfaceLIC plugin in a script intended to be executed by pvbatch. Naturally, I used the trace tool in the GUI to design my python script. When save the state in python and try to run it with pvbatch it raises the following error :


ensight_full_cyclescaseDisplay.SelectInputVectors = ['POINTS', 'vitesse']
  File "/usr/lib/lib/python2.7/site-packages/paraview/servermanager.py", line 453, in __setattr__
    "to add this attribute.")
AttributeError: Attribute SelectInputVectors does not exist.  This class does not allow addition of new attributes to avoid mistakes due to typos. Use add_attribute() if you really want to add this attribute.


but if I just load state in the paraview GUI with the exact same script, paraview does not complain. Any workaround ?


In fact, by searching a solution, it seems that the ensight_full_cyclescaseDisplay object has a dictionary called _Proxy__Properties which contain a key 'SelectInputVectors'. The problem is that the SelectInputVectors value is a dead weakref object... and I'm not really familiar with weakref objects.

Lionel,

Does your Python script load the plugin explcitly? Currently none of
the state files capture which plugins are loaded, you have to manually
load the plugin. You can use  the following to load the plugin in your
script before creating any of the proxies.

LoadDistributedPlugin("SurfaceLIC", ns=globals())

Utkarsh,
Thanks for the so quick reply :)
Actually I explicitly load the plugin with the following command : 
LoadPlugin('/usr/lib/paraview-5.4/plugins/SurfaceLIC/libSurfaceLIC.so', remote=True, ns=globals())

I tried to load it with the command you suggested but it raises the same error.

While i'm continuing looking for a solution, I saw this old thred https://public.kitware.com/pipermail/paraview/2012-July/025681.html
I tried to use a command like 
extractBlock1Display_1 = Show(extractBlock1, View4)
extractBlock1Display_1.Representation = 'Surface LIC'
extractBlock1Display_1.SMProxy.GetProperty('SelectInputVectors').SetElement(0,['POINTS', 'vitesse'])

but it still does not work...
Thanks in advance,

Lionel

Lionel,

There's indeed a bug there. A temporary workaround is as follows:

LoadDistributedPlugin("SurfaceLIC", ns=globals())
Disconnect()
Connect()

A fix for the issue is here:
https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/merge_requests/1898
I'll have it merged in before the next release.

Hi Paraviewers,

I am trying to extract points based on the coordinates. I tried to use
"Find Data" but with no success. I am wondering how can I obtain such a
goal with "Find Data"? Or is there a workaround?

FYI, I am using Paraview 5.4.1-RC3 64-bit on Windows 10.

Subject: [Paraview] Take spatial average on slice along a direction with a
	single filter
Message-ID: <8bc7226c-331a-0244-ea6e-75d2beb93169@shuhaowu.com>

Hello all,

What I want to do is to take a bunch of X slices in my domain and 
compute the average on that slice for a particular quantity. I want to 
then be able to plot this as a line plot (X vs average quantity) and 
also find the coordinate X of a specific average quantity.

I'm having trouble doing this in a single filter. Is this something that 
is supported? Right now my script is creating many slices and 
programmable filter (for averaging into a vtkTable) and then a 
programmable filter at the end combines all of the slices into a single 
vtkTable that I can use to plot. This can lead to hundreds of filters, 
which degrades performance drastically. I don't feel like this is the 
"correct" way to do things. Does anyone else know a better way?

Thanks,
Shuhao

Thanks, Cory,
I can count the particles in a clip box but can you help me how to adjust
the desired location of clip box because I have to use lot of clip box
filters to cover the whole domain in small box domains.

Hello.
Possibly the Threshold filter is what you looking for (if you need to
select a number of points in specified coordinates range). You can use 2-3
filters in series to shape the region in 3 cartesian directions.

Subject: [Paraview] Rendering problem with the Streamline Representation
	plugin
Message-ID: <1505225937791.47900@epfl.ch>

Dear Paraviewers,


I found sevral rendering issues in the Streamline Representation plugin. In order the issue to be reproducible, I followed the "How to test ?" section on this page https://blog.kitware.com/new-animated-stream-lines-representation-for-paraview-5-3/. In order to see what I'm talking about, one can open Paraview (GUI) tools -> Python Shell -> run script -> PVstateSurfRepBug.py (I load the plugin in the script)


1. The streamlines appear in green as default color. If I try to set their color to white in the GUI it does not work (Gradient proxy -> Coloring -> edit color map). The user must first set the color as some other preset and then the GUI sets the DiffuseColor attribute to whatever the user choose.

2. In addition to the gradient filter, if a slice filter is attached to the wavelet source, even if the streamlines should be displayed (because the slice plane is behind the streamlines) they do always show. If the representation type of the slice is Point Gaussian, Surface or Surface with edges, they do not show but the other representation types work well

3. If I want to record an animation of the streamlines, the "Transparent Background" option leads to strange animation (with AVI format but not with OGG/Theora).


Despite these little bugs, I'd like to thank the developpers for this awsome plugin !! It realy helps to understand and interpret CFD results :)


Kindly,


Lionel Wilhelm

Hello Andrew,

Thanks for your response. I tried the Threshold filter for my data
(attached behind), I still cannot figure out how to choose points using
coordinates. In the Properties tab of Threshold filter, I can only use
diameter to specify the data range. Coordinate is not an option in the drop
down list (see picture below).

[image: Inline image 1]

Could you explain more about how to use coordinates of the points in the
threshold filter, please?

Thanks,
Yifei

This is on the todo list.

Although I don?t like the filter, use the probe filter.  Turn Auto Apply on.  Make sure that the probe filter is selected.  Type in your coordinates, or use the P key.

I just tried, and was stopped (I believe) by asking for more MPI ranks than cores.  I got an MPI error.  pvserver never even started.

Hi,

You are right about this limitation. It happens because originally this
feature has been developed to analyze series. However, it could be quite
easily ported to any other dataset. Maybe you could add an entry on the
ParaView bug tracker about?

Best,
Joachim

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview MIP viewer
Message-ID: <F5CBC4BE-A687-45DD-A757-1503E52EA2B8@gmail.com>

Hi everyone, 

I am struggling with the paraview MIP viewer (Maximum Intensity Projection Viewer) right now. 
I know the basic settings in paraview doesn?t have the mip viewer designed in it, so I compiled it from the source code, and added the blend mode in the volume rendering, to allow the mip viewer.

Once I?ve finished the compilation, Under Volume representation, there are 4 modes of Volume Rendering. Smart, Ray Cast Only, GPU Based, and OSPRay Based. The other three seems to be different modes, and the Smart mode seems to be the best match of mode the app automatically selects for you. 

I have two different mac os?s, Sierra and Yosemite. 
The GPU Based volume rendering works fine for my Sierra OS, and gives great quality of the MIP viewer, 
however it does not work in my Yosemite OS. 
The other 2 modes of Volume Rendering do not even work in either OS?s. 

Has anyone encountered any similar problem?
They both have good graphic cards. 

Is it really just a problem of the OS? or is there anyone who solved any problems concerning the MIP viewer, please let me know.

Thanks,

Enoch Pae

Yifei,

I don't understand the issue.
I DL'ed your file and proceeded as follows
Edit/Settings/General/Auto Convert Properties checked (On)

Find Data
Find POINTS in test_data.vtu
Loc(0) is >= 0.009
Run Selection Query
Extract Selection

This correctly extracted the 1 point met that requirement

If I change to a query of
(Loc[:,0] >= .008) & (Loc[:,1] >= -.0004)  then it correctly selects the single point that meets that criteria.

Perhaps the difficulty is because you haven't  set Auto Convert Properties

Hope this helps.
Dennis

Expanding issue 1:
I have created the simple programmable source below, which creates a periodic animation to demonstrate the problem of double display of time steps in periodic data. It is a line that moves according to a sine-function with 3 as cycle duration. When the animation ist set to loop and runs as Sequence with No. Frames=4 , the output reads 0,1,2,3,0,1,2,3,0,... Since step 0 and 3 are equal and both are called, the script exemplifies my problem.
(One issue I ran into creating the source: It is not possible to just set a TIME_RANGE in a programmable source. If I do, the maximum time is not used in the ParaView GUI. Maybe this is linked to the second issue from my original mail?)

Are there more suggestions anyone can share? Should I maybe create bug reports, so that the devs can look at my problems?

Thanks,
Heinrich

Betreff: AW: [Paraview] Two issues with time-dependent data

Thanks Cory for your idea. The problem is, that I would have to set the end of the TIME_RANGE dependently on the timesteps requested by ParaView. Otherwise the delta t between timesteps will not be equal. I could modify my filter so that the user has to select the number of timesteps in it. But I was hoping to use the already present functionalities of ParaView.

Cheers,
Heinrich

Can you just set the upper end of the TIME_RANGE to one timestep
before what you have now? In other words, instead of having the first
and last timesteps provide the same data, end the TIME_RANGE earlier
by one timestep. That will prevent the doubling of the timestep when
the animation resets.

I'm not sure about this one. Maybe someone else can chime in.

Yes, it works.

Paraview 5.4 with OpenMPI 1.7.3

konsole???bash???mpirun???80*[pvserver]
         ??bash
         ??{konsole}

Node: 20 cores with hyperthreading.

It should be related to your mpi environment: may be oversubscribing (more than 
one mpi process by core) is not the default behavior.

Hi,


I would like to use Catalyst to visualize a distributed directed graph. Each node of the graph is characterized by an id (not necessarily contiguous, as some nodes are added and removed during the execution) and a list of connections (ids of "friends").


The nodes can be assigned coordinates in a 2D or a 3D space.


Do you have an example of adaptor for that?


Also if I want to use coordinates in higher dimensions, would I need to project to a 3D subspace or is there a way for ParaView to figure out a layout to display the graph?


Thanks,


Matthieu

Hi Matthieu,

There isn't a Catalyst example for graphs but it shouldn't be too hard to
make. I'm not very familiar with the vtkGraph and derived classes but if I
were to to try doing that I'd just see how the graph object is generated in
some filter that generates one (look in the RequestData() method).

As for visualizing graphs in ParaView, hopefully someone else on the list
can provide insight on doing that.

Best,
Andy

I am tempted to second that. There's nothing in ParaView that checks
how many cores your node has, as a result if there's a cap, it's
coming from the MPI implementation itself.

vtkMutableDirectedGraph
<https://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkMutableDirectedGraph.html>
has an API that is hopefully pretty intuitive with AddVertex, AddEdge, etc.
You can also shallow-copy from the mutable graph into a DAG object, which
performs a check, if it is important to verify you made a proper DAG. From
the vtkDirectedAcyclicGraph docs
<https://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkDirectedAcyclicGraph.html> (I
noticed some typos here, should read "DAG" instead of "tree"):

=====
vtkDirectedAcyclicGraph is a read-only data structure. To construct a tree,
create an instance of vtkMutableDirectedGraph. Add vertices and edges with
AddVertex() and AddEdge(). You may alternately start by adding a single
vertex as the root then call graph->AddChild(parent) which adds a new
vertex and connects the parent to the child. The tree MUST have all edges
in the proper direction, from parent to child. After building the tree,
call tree->CheckedShallowCopy(graph) to copy the structure into a
vtkDirectedAcyclicGraph. This method will return false if the graph is an
invalid tree.
=====

As for rendering in ParaView, you the following example shows how to use
vtkGraphToPolyData, but this is not exposed in ParaView to my knowledge, I
think you would need a plugin, or preprocess the graph into a vtkPolyData,
save it, then load into ParaView.

https://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK/Examples/Cxx/Graphs/GraphToPolyData

Embedding from higher-dimensional coordinates into 2D or 3D does not have a
VTK implementation that I know of, though PCA in VTK may be able to be
used. If you want to do layout based on edge connectivity, there are some graph
layout algorithms
<https://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkGraphLayoutStrategy.html> in
VTK that could get you 2D or 3D coordinates.

HTH,
Jeff

Hi Dennis,

Sorry that I wasn't clear about the data file. The "Loc" DataArray is not
included in the original data. I simply copy&paste the "Position" DataArray
and re-named it "Loc" in order to find data based on its location. This is
a workaround and it works just fine for small data files. However, my
original data is quit huge and I have to do the copy&paste for thousands of
files to make the workaround work. Also file size will be increased
significantly by using this method. Since the "Position" information is
already included in each data file. I am wondering if there is a way to
access it in "Find Data". If so, I don't need to replicate it to create
"Loc".

Thanks,
Yifei

If you're running on the DSRCs I'm guessing that the limit is coming from
the node selection option (i.e. "#PBS -l select=8:ncpus=36:mpiprocs=8").
mpiprocs here is the number of MPI processes per node while ncpus is the
number of cores per node (in this case only nodes that have 36 cores per
node will be used. I've never tried having mpiprocs higher than ncpus. I
would guess that a simple MPI helloworld would really show whether or not
this is where the limit is coming from.

Best,
Andy

Yifei,

I don?t know anything about vtu files ? I don?t see any array of ?Position?.

However, perhaps you can use vector array coords ? this is Paraviews internal array of point positions.   You could use this to create Loc after you read your file into Paraview ? your filesize would not increase, although you would use some memory for the duplicate of coords (I assume running Calculator does a deep copy, anyone able to correct me)

So, read in file, run calculator on it ? add Point Data Array Name of Loc ? from the Vectors dropdown add coords to expression.   Now you will have a vector called Loc and my earlier queries will work.

I could not get the queries to work directly with the coords vector array ? maybe someone else knows how to do that.

Yifei,

I don?t understand the issue.
I DL?ed your file and proceeded as follows
Edit/Settings/General/Auto Convert Properties checked (On)

Find Data
Find POINTS in test_data.vtu
Loc(0) is >= 0.009
Run Selection Query
Extract Selection

This correctly extracted the 1 point met that requirement

If I change to a query of
(Loc[:,0] >= .008) & (Loc[:,1] >= -.0004)  then it correctly selects the single point that meets that criteria.

Perhaps the difficulty is because you haven?t  set Auto Convert Properties

Hope this helps.

Hi Dennis,

Calculator filter did the trick. I created Loc using vector array coords.
Then I have no problem finding the points using Find Data by specifying
certain Loc.

Thanks for the help.

Yifei,

Glad that helped.   If memory becomes critical, you could write a Programmable Filter that created array Loc by shallow copying array coords ? this would sharply reduce the memory footprint of the Loc array.

Next time I?ll ask you for help!

Hi Dennis,

Calculator filter did the trick. I created Loc using vector array coords. Then I have no problem finding the points using Find Data by specifying certain Loc.

Thanks for the help.

Yifei,

I don?t know anything about vtu files ? I don?t see any array of ?Position?.

However, perhaps you can use vector array coords ? this is Paraviews internal array of point positions.   You could use this to create Loc after you read your file into Paraview ? your filesize would not increase, although you would use some memory for the duplicate of coords (I assume running Calculator does a deep copy, anyone able to correct me)

So, read in file, run calculator on it ? add Point Data Array Name of Loc ? from the Vectors dropdown add coords to expression.   Now you will have a vector called Loc and my earlier queries will work.

I could not get the queries to work directly with the coords vector array ? maybe someone else knows how to do that.

 WARNING - External email; exercise caution.



Hi Dennis,

Sorry that I wasn't clear about the data file. The "Loc" DataArray is not included in the original data. I simply copy&paste the "Position" DataArray and re-named it "Loc" in order to find data based on its location. This is a workaround and it works just fine for small data files. However, my original data is quit huge and I have to do the copy&paste for thousands of files to make the workaround work. Also file size will be increased significantly by using this method. Since the "Position" information is already included in each data file. I am wondering if there is a way to access it in "Find Data". If so, I don't need to replicate it to create "Loc".

Thanks,
Yifei

Yifei,

I don?t understand the issue.
I DL?ed your file and proceeded as follows
Edit/Settings/General/Auto Convert Properties checked (On)

Find Data
Find POINTS in test_data.vtu
Loc(0) is >= 0.009
Run Selection Query
Extract Selection

This correctly extracted the 1 point met that requirement

If I change to a query of
(Loc[:,0] >= .008) & (Loc[:,1] >= -.0004)  then it correctly selects the single point that meets that criteria.

Perhaps the difficulty is because you haven?t  set Auto Convert Properties

Hope this helps.

I am tempted to second that. There's nothing in ParaView that checks how
many cores your node has, as a result if there's a cap, it's coming from the
MPI implementation itself.

A little bit more background information, we were trying to run it on Wai (large SMP machine) and we ran into issue getting more than 64 core for our setup. Let?s see if a simple MPI hello world will show where the limit is coming from.

________________________________



If you're running on the DSRCs I'm guessing that the limit is coming from the node selection option (i.e. "#PBS -l select=8:ncpus=36:mpiprocs=8"). mpiprocs here is the number of MPI processes per node while ncpus is the number of cores per node (in this case only nodes that have 36 cores per node will be used. I've never tried having mpiprocs higher than ncpus. I would guess that a simple MPI helloworld would really show whether or not this is where the limit is coming from.

Andy

Hi Mathieu,

The bug in v5.4.1 is still there, see the screenshots. The last version where this worked was 5.1.
I have tried version ParaView-5.4.1-Qt5-OpenGL2-Windows-64bit now.

Subject: [Paraview] Clearing a selection created in python
Message-ID: <CAJbHkX8mJQZwYr38CCT2w1DV67YpVX8itbTqNvZs=1OYnqL4ig@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, I'm trying to create a selection using python, but I have a little
question

I use this script (as a macro)

source = GetActiveSource()
activeView = GetActiveView()
props = GetDisplayProperties(source,view=activeView)
fieldtype, arrayname = props.ColorArrayName
a = paraview.simple._select(fieldtype[0:-1], arrayname,source)
Render()

this will highlight all the entities (points or cells) with values
different form zero in the current view (this work great)

the only problem is that the clear selection icon ("garbage icon") is
disable and the only way to clear the selection is to create a new
selection (using the mouse) and the clear it using the button.

Any ideas.
thanks

Felipe

Hi,

ParaView has line cells which is what you probably want to use. The line
cells themselves have no concept of cross section but you can add that as
field data.

Beyond this, how are you getting your points into ParaView? Wherever that
is being done you'll probably want to add in the line cells at that point
in your workflow. Another option is using the Python Programmable Filter to
make those cells -- see
https://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Python_Programmable_Filter.

Cheers,
Andy

Message-ID: <VI1P194MB0127934DC375A7AC309DC270976F0@VI1P194MB0127.EURP194.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

Hello,


I have a vtkImageData object that I write (with a XMLPImageDataWriter) every time step to a pvti file.

When I open the group of output_*.pvti files, properties like X, Y, Z extent and range do not change as I animate over time.

But when I open the actual files I can see that these values in fact are different.


And if I open the files individually (for example output_99.pvti) these properties are displayed correctly in ParaView.

The problem appears when I open them as a group; it then keeps the properties of the first file.


Does anyone else has this issue, and is there a way to solve this?


Best,

Jimmy

that, what am I looking at here?
Essentially, I want a scatter plot of the average along width.

Thanks!

I don?t think there is anything ready made that will do what you are describing. However, I think if your points are lined up along the x axis (assuming width=x), I think you can fake it by squishing the data to a line and telling ParaView to merge coincident points (clean the data). Try the following steps:


1.       Add the Transform filter. Change the Scale parameter to [0, 1, 1]. Apply.

2.       Add the Clean to Grid filter. Apply.

3.       Add the Plot Over Line filter. Apply.

Another alternative is to just create a scatterplot with the Y value on the bottom axis and the value on the right. (Turn off lines, turn on markers.) It?s different than showing the average, but it contains more information.

Hey all!

I have an unstructured grid type data(it is cell data, image attached below). I wish to do a plot in paraview such that I am averaging along the width, and plotting this averaged data along the length. In order to do that, what am I looking at here?
Essentially, I want a scatter plot of the average along width.

Thanks!

Dear Cory,


Many thanks for your reply pointing out the known limitations and suggestions 
for restoring with python. I tried to give that a try:
https://github.com/romangrothausmann/ParaView_scripts/blob/146aa352d1a3ada203bcf91d17e11c169bc99583/pvsm-multi.py#L44-L61

but am stuck at the python error:
TypeError: SetProperties() takes at most 1 argument (2 given)
while the docs suggest to specify 2 args:
https://www.paraview.org/ParaView/Doc/Nightly/www/py-doc/paraview.simple.html?highlight=getproperty#paraview.simple.SetProperties

What am I missing here? Do I have to set each property by itself (i.e. from 
GetProperty) or can I just set the whole list of properties from 
ListProperties() in one go?
Is the approach for restoring to go through all objects from the last LoadState 
the right one?

Many thanks for looking into this.
Roman

Put a ** in front of reppro[i], e.g.,

pvs.SetProperties(repr, **reppro[i])

That works for me. The ** unpacks the dictionary into a variable
keyword parameter. See [1] for more info.

No problem.

Hm, I now get:
TypeError: SetProperties() argument after ** must be a mapping, not list
Do I have to store the dict of object properties in another dict instead of a list?

Ah, I didn't read far enough up in your code to see how `reppro` is
defined. ListProperties() just gives you the names of the properties,
not a list or dictionary with the values. You can create a dictionary
of properties and their values with

d = {}
for p in s.ListProperties():
  d[p] = GetProperty(s, p)
reppro.append(d)

Simon,

The answer depends on whether you want to ParaView to use GPU for
rendering alone or also for computation e.g. contours. For former,
it's automatic via OpenGL. So long as your environment and/or your
build is set up such that ParaView picks up the OpenGL implementation
provided by your GPU drivers, you'll get GPU acceleration. For
GPU-accelerated algorithms, you have to enable VTK-m support at build
time and then enable CUDA support for VTM-m. Currently, you need
create special filters via the VTM-m plugin [1] to use accelerated
versions of common algorithms like contour. In future, this will be
automatic, and you will be able to simply use the generic filters.

Hope that helps.

Utkarsh

Hi Utkarsh,

Thank you for your reply and your explanation. And unfortunately we are looking into possibly using GPU- accelerated algorithm. We will look into getting vtk-m configured in our ParaView.

Thanks

Hi Cory,

I am trying again to install paraview 5.3. I have downloaded it from the 
paraview webpage. I am using Ubuntu 16.04 LTS; OS type 64-bit. Then I 
followed these steps:

tar xzvf ParaView-5.3.0-Qt5-OpenGL2-MPI-Linux-64bit.tar.gz

sudo mv ParaView-5.3.0-Qt5-OpenGL2-MPI-Linux-64bit /opt/

sudo emacs ~/.bashrc # and added the following lines:

export PATH=$PATH:/opt/ParaView-5.3.0-Qt5-OpenGL2-MPI-Linux-64bit/bin/
export 
PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/home/doriad/bin/ParaView/Utilities/VTKPythonWrapping/site-packages 
#fixes "no module named paraview"
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/home/doriad/bin/ParaView/bin #fixes 
"ImportError: No module named libvtkCommonPython"
export 
PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/opt/ParaView-5.3.0-Qt5-OpenGL2-MPI-Linux-64bit/lib/python2.7/site-packagesexport 
PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/opt/ParaView-5.3.0-Qt5-OpenGL2-MPI-Linux-64bit/lib/paraview-5.3

Saved and exit

#Created the symbolic links

sudo ln -s /opt/ParaView-5.3.0-Qt5-OpenGL2-MPI-Linux-64bit/ 
/usr/bin/paraview

sudo ln -s /opt/ParaView-5.3.0-Qt5-OpenGL2-MPI-Linux-64bit/ 
/usr/lib/paraview

#Restarted the computer and then executed:

./paraview

And paraview opens and works fine.

# Execute the script I mentioned in previous emails:

./<the name of the script>

And the following error message appears:

Error: Could not import vtkCommonComputationalGeometry
Traceback (most recent call last):
   File "./<name of script>", line 42, in <module>
     from paraview.simple import *
   File

line 43, in <module>
     from paraview import servermanager
   File

line 53, in <module>
     from paraview import vtk

line 9, in <module>
     from vtkCommonCorePython import *
ImportError: No module named vtkCommonCorePython

Then I tried running it by using:

./pvpython <name of script>

And the error message is the following:

bash: ./pvpython: No such file or directory

I have also tried by using:

/opt/ParaView-5.3.0-Qt5-OpenGL2-MPI-Linux-64bit/bin/pvpython <name of script>

And the message is:

/opt/ParaView-5.3.0-Qt5-OpenGL2-MPI-Linux-64bit/lib/paraview-5.3/libgfortran.so.3: version `GFORTRAN_1.4' not found (required by /usr/lib/libarpack.so.2)
Traceback (most recent call last):

     reader = OpenDataFile(prefix+ '.vtu');
   File "/opt/ParaView-5.3.0-Qt5-OpenGL2-MPI-Linux-64bit/lib/python2.7/site-packages/paraview/simple.py", line 846, in OpenDataFile
     raise RuntimeError (msg)

My python version is (python --version) Python 2.7.12

My script starts with:
#!/usr/bin/python
import re,sys,os,shutil
-- and I also use --
from paraview.simple import *

Sorry for the inconveniences.

Really grateful,

Guillermo S.

Hello,

I could use some help with vizualizing an unstructured grid.
I've got an .VTU / XML file with values in a scalar field, which act as 
color ids. I want to colorize my mesh according to these values. The 
values should be interpretet as categories, so I checked this option in 
ParaView. As long as my values are below or equal 31, everything works 
out fine. But as soon as I use the full data range (242 different 
values), ParaView gives an error:? Could not determine discrete values 
using the data produced by the current source/filter. Please add 
annotations manually.
If I do enter some values by hand, it works nicely again. But entering 
more than 200 values by hand is not really an option.
To see if the determination fails because of missing values between 0 
and 242, I checked the scalars, but everything seems to be fine.

Could anyone give me a hint on how to proceed / what to try?

Thanks, cheers,
Michael

Subject: [Paraview] problem with visibility control in the animation view ...
Message-ID: <d01c1805-e304-20be-259e-eee8a385f82a@be.itu.edu.tr>

Hi,

I am trying to create animation by playing visibility of a Tube. In this 
case, the visibility of the Tube is 0 at the beginning but after certain 
time step (at 30), i am setting it to 1. Until this point everything 
fine and i could define it in the animation panel but when i go to a 
specific time step that visibility is 1 (i.e. 30), the Tube is appearing 
but ParaView also enable the Polar Axes which is not enabled in the 
original visualization pipeline. The visualization is deformed due to 
this problem because the polar coordinate axes is appearing in the 
middle of the visualization. I think that there is a bug in both 
ParaView 5.3 and 5.4.1 and it enable this feature by default when the 
animation control is used. Anyway, until it is fixed, i just wonder that 
is there any work around to fix this problem.

Regards,

Hi dear users,

This might sound a bit stupid, but I am new in paraview and I have hard times understanding how this tool works: for instance, I do not understand how is paraview reading info such as radius in specific points, how can I generate surface and not just some floating points in space, how can I build based on cross sectional area and height. So far, the only info I could implement is x, y and z of points through csv file.

Could anyone please support me with theoretical material and so on?

Thank you!

I would really appreciate an example of a 3D model file readable in paraview.

Hi,

Welcome to ParaView!

It sounds like you might find several items in ParaView's help menu useful:

* Getting Started with ParaView
* ParaView Tutorial
* ParaView Guide

If you have more specific questions about how to load your data,
please describe the kind of data you have. Is it points? Is it a
volumetric mesh? Etc.

Thanks,
Cory

Doina,


Welcome to ParaView.


Here is the URL for the user's guide: 
https://www.paraview.org/paraview-guide/

(In the second paragraph "(CE)" click on the first blue here.)


First comment, ParaView is not a mesh generator. (It does have a number 
of displayable graphics objects, for example, a sphere. They are are 
ordinarily used for testing and/or for demonstration of ParaView's 
filters, et cetera.


Second, one needs to select an input format that ParaView understands 
and use that format to "describe" your simulation results, that is, 
describe your mesh, the datum set that resides at Points and the datum 
set that resides in the Cells.

The simplest (well documented) format is the VTK-Classic format, an 
all-ASCII format (see attached document). There is a caution when using 
this format guide, namely, the guide is concise and complete, but the 
information is stated only once and not necessarily where you would 
expect to find it.? One more caution --? The VTK READER in ParaView was 
written by a C-language programmer, and the input array-location 
information requested is in offsets. A value in the array A(1:100) at 
the first location is at "0" and the item at the end of the array is at 
location "99"

Just about all useful formats will have the information needed by the 
VTK-Classic format and once you have mastered this format, the other 
formats will make more sense.

Hope this helps,

Sure, you can, but it may be slow.

Could you define your subdomains in a regular grid structure with a
number of even divisions in X, Y, and Z? If so, you may be better off
creating a grid structure with your 200 subdomains and then use the
vtkCellLocator approach I outlined earlier in this thread.

Hi,

Please keep the discussions on the mailing list so that everyone that wants
to see what was discussed can.

https://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Data_formats#CSV_.28Comma_Separated_Variable.29_files
has information on reading in a csv file into ParaView. From this though
you will still need to convert this information into points and then add
cells as needed. The ParaView User's Guide is available at
https://www.paraview.org/paraview-guide/ and should be able to give you
more guidance on what you want to do.

Cheers,
Andy

Setting the PYTHONPATH is not necessary to use pvpython. pvpython sets
up the necessary system paths within the Python executable so you
don't have to.

This command means "launch the paraview executable in my current
working directory". To use the paraview executable in your PATH,
remove the ./ and run

paraview

This will make sure the paraview found on your PATH is executed.

Again, when you run ./pvpython, it is looking for a pvpython
executable in the present working directory. Drop the ./ and it should
work.

This is strange. I don't see the same when I download ParaView 5.3 on
Ubuntu 16.04. I wonder if you are pulling in something by setting
PYTHONPATH? Try not setting PYTHONPATH (it isn't needed to use
pvpython) and see if that resolves the error.

HTH,
Cory

Sorry but I could not fix it.

I removed the ParaView-5.3.0-Qt5-OpenGL2-MPI-Linux-64bit from /opt/ 
directory

Reinstalled paraview following the steps I have indicated on the 
previous email.

I have deleted all sentences from ~/.bashrc except the first one: "export PATH=$PATH:/opt/ParaView-5.3.0-Qt5-OpenGL2-MPI-Linux-64bit/bin/"

Run paraview as:

paraview

And worked fine.
However I executed the script as you indicated:

pvpython <name of script>

And the error message is:

/opt/ParaView-5.3.0-Qt5-OpenGL2-MPI-Linux-64bit/lib/paraview-5.3/libgfortran.so.3:
version `GFORTRAN_1.4' not found (required by /usr/lib/libarpack.so.2)
Traceback (most recent call last):
   File <name of script>, line 47, in <module>
     reader = OpenDataFile(prefix+ '.vtu'); #This is sentence from my script
   File
"/opt/ParaView-5.3.0-Qt5-OpenGL2-MPI-Linux-64bit/lib/python2.7/site-packages/paraview/simple.py",
line 846, in OpenDataFile
     raise RuntimeError (msg)

I am really sorry for the inconveniences. Guillermo

Subject: [Paraview] ugly stripe when drawing topographic plot
Message-ID: <HK2PR01MB12681BF06425414AB01808ACEA630@HK2PR01MB1268.apcprd01.prod.exchangelabs.com>

Hello everyone,

I use .xyz(to store x,y,z points) and .dat(to store fields like pressure, temperature, etc.) to draw some value on the surface, some plots are very beautiful, but someones are not.

Attached is an example, I drew a field on surface(extract subset or isosurface, the surface is smooth), but there were
ugly stripe in the same direction like the plot. Did any one meet this before? I try to use some filters like SPHinterpolation, but not effective.

Thanks a lot and looking forward your replys!

Yi

Hi Utkarsh,

is there a sure way to tell if our ParaView VTK-m compilation has the correct 
CUDA support?  For the superbuild process, is there a way to force the 
detection of CUDA library and fail the superbuild process if CUDA library is 
not correctly detected? thank you

thanks
-simon

Simon,

The answer depends on whether you want to ParaView to use GPU for rendering 
alone or also for computation e.g. contours. For former, it's automatic via 
OpenGL. So long as your environment and/or your build is set up such that 
ParaView picks up the OpenGL implementation provided by your GPU drivers, 
you'll get GPU acceleration. For GPU-accelerated algorithms, you have to 
enable VTK-m support at build time and then enable CUDA support for VTM-m. 
Currently, you need create special filters via the VTM-m plugin [1] to use 
accelerated versions of common algorithms like contour. In future, this will 
be automatic, and you will be able to simply use the generic filters.

Hope that helps.

Utkarsh

But where as in higher order element mesh.
If i follow the same procedure, I don't see the sphere surface instead I see only the elements in the cube. 

Could anyone please tell me how to solve this problem.

Message-ID: <2136105821.22613.1505933137381.JavaMail.zimbra@be.itu.edu.tr>

Hi, 

I am trying to perform volume rendering (VR) using multi-block + multi-piece dataset. In this case, the data file has single block that contains multiple piece (created by MPI parallel simulation code) and it is in structured grid. When I try to use volume rendering with raw data, it creates empty output but if I use Merge Block filter before using volume rendering, it works without any problem. So, I have to use Merge Blocks to perform VR. At this point, I just wonder that is it typical behaviour of ParaView for multi-block + multi-piece datasets? Is it still possible to perform VR in parallel if I had a multiple core (such as enabling Auto MPI from the settings)? If not is there any way to re-structure the data to perform more efficient rendering? 

Best Regards, 

--ufuk

Hi Ufuk,

ParaView doesn't currently support volume rendering of multiblock datasets,
even in serial, so using the Merge Blocks filter is probably the best way
to do any volume rendering of your dataset.

Cheers,
Andy

Hi,

What do you mean by the extract operator? ParaView has a variety of filters
(similar to VisIt's operators) for performing extracts of different types.
Could you also share your dataset? That may make it easier to diagnose the
issue.

Best,
Andy

Hi Andy,

Thanks for the clarification. One minor question, after applying Merge 
Blocks is it still processing in serial mode or can i use MPI to improve 
the performance? By the way, i am also using NVIDIA Index plugin. I 
think that it supports parallel rendering but again not for multi block 
dataset. Right?

Regards,

--ufuk

Hello

Please keep the discussion in the mailing list so everyone can contribute.

Your dataset (OJF_Out-SPECIES.DAT) does not seem to have the right Tecplot
format.
Please take a look to this tecplot .dat file (residuals.dat) , wich can be
opened with ParaView flawlessly.
You may try to correct your file manually or correct the way it was
generated.

Best,

Mathieu Westphal

Hi Ufuk,

The Merge Blocks filter will work locally on each process and shouldn't
move any of the data between MPI processes since it's a trivially parallel
operation. When doing volume rendering of unstructured grids (the output
dataset type of the merge blocks filter) with Ice-T in parallel, there will
be data moved around in order to simplify and reduce the parallel
communication by constructing convex partitions.

I don't know how NVIDIA's Index plugin works in parallel but my guess would
be that it also wants convex partitions.

Cheers,
Andy

Hi Simon,

Currently the VTK-m support that is offered by the ParaView superbuild
doesn't support enabling CUDA. I am in the process of adding this
option to the superbuild and can notify you when this feature has been
merged in. In the short-term you would want to manual modify the vtk-m
CMAKE_ARGS entry in the superbuild to have VTKm_ENABLE_CUDA:BOOL=ON.

Hello Robert,

thank you for your reply and we are looking forward to your email. Joe has 
made some progress on that front on one of our newly installed system. We are 
seeing some 12x performance gain on our compute nodes with GPU hardware. We 
are looking into system wide deployment and having to be able to do it from 
superbuild will significantly help simplify our deployment process.

thanks
-simon

Message-ID: <CAFgDerEWqXcT9bxMigAJ=gWxMD_hyyuzm4yms4RafV_YFF+jGQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I have a set of vtu files that represent a time series of spatial data. I
would like to visualize it via the arctic viewer. Ultimately, I'd like
something similar to the Flat earth probing example given here (
http://tonic.kitware.com/). However it's unclear how to convert a vtu to
the required json format.

The documentation is lacking in this regard and the example data is not
helpful for reverse engineering what is needed.

Would appreciate any insight.

Cheers
Chris

Hi Chris,

Thanks for your interest. The following Python scripts provide an example
on how to generate such dataset.

https://github.com/Kitware/arctic-viewer/blob/master/scripts/examples/paraview/mpas/raw-probe-flat-earth.py
https://github.com/Kitware/arctic-viewer/blob/master/scripts/examples/vtk/mpas/raw-probe-flat-earth.py

Moreover, depending on your data structure, the way you want to iterate
through time may differ.
The example below show the can dataset with a geometry export. But at
least, it also show how to control time in ParaView when the reader is Time
aware.

https://github.com/Kitware/arctic-viewer/blob/master/scripts/examples/paraview/samples/VTKGeometry-can.py

Let me know if you need additional information regarding that script and
what it is doing.

Seb

Hi all,


I created the Tecplot table data importer a while ago. As the tecplot file format is very flexible, it is impossible to create a reader that caters to all possibilities (without knowledge on how the format can be used). So, the residuals.dat file is an example that our simulation code writes and that is readable by Tecplot (and now also ParaView). Its reader is based on the CSV reader that existed already. Currently, the VARIABLES must be on one line and the data needs to be in the same number of columns and the VARIABLES. Otherwise, as you experienced, it won't work.


You're more than welcome to expand the support for more ways in which the format can be used. Just be sure that the residuals.dat file can still be read ;-)


All the best,
Menno

Hello

Please keep the discussion in the mailing list so everyone can contribute.

Your dataset (OJF_Out-SPECIES.DAT) does not seem to have the right Tecplot format.
Please take a look to this tecplot .dat file (residuals.dat) , wich can be opened with ParaView flawlessly.
You may try to correct your file manually or correct the way it was generated.

Best,

Hi Sebastien,
This is very helpful, thanks!

Current hangup is that vtk.web.* is not available. I've installed vtk
--with-python via homebrew (I use vtk successfully from python regularly).
However the web components do not seem available. Googling isn't helping
me. Any suggestions?

Cheers
Chris

Just download ParaView binary and use pvpython. You will have everything
required meaning both vtk and paraview side of things.

Ah yes, that works. Thanks.

I have modified the 2nd example (vtk) to work on a single vtu file I have
(so no time) and output a single array. It appears to complete fully and it
writes the the tar fiels to my data directory.
When I try to serve up these data, I'm presented with a static image of the
head sample dataset I had previously loaded. Rebooting and killall node did
not resolve this.
Using a different port shows a blank page.

Thanks for the help,

Cheers
Chris

Hello list,

Where is the data structure(s) in the code where all the objects for the state of a particular ParaView session are kept while it is running?. I have been reading the code but can't figure it out. As far as I understand, the state (which can be saved to XML) is all it takes to recreate a session (Am I right here? Probably you need the input data as well, right?).

Thanks for the help!,

Subject: [Paraview] Updated OpenVR/Vive support
Message-ID: <CANXz0SYzNOsnjsof9C_Mo4YG6jq-qNRy5BzK95CvABe4C7W1zg@mail.gmail.com>

A quick update on some improved support for OpenVR/Vive in ParaView. Over
the past few months there has been a lot of work put into improving the
integration of OpenVR with ParaView and VTK including extending VTK's event
model to better handle 3D events. Almost all of these changes have been
merged to VTK and PV master now for you to enjoy. They are still in
development so you may run into issues crashes etc. Here are some of the
new features


   - OpenVR support is now a plugin that can loaded into PV like any other
   plugin. It does require PV be built with the vtkRenderingOpenVR modules
   though.
   - The ParaView GUI no longer locks up when in VR this allows animations
   etc to be run while in VR (alpha, send to VR first then start the animation)
   - It now supports selection of scalar field while in VR
   - It now supports adding multiple crop widgets in VR
   - It no longer depends on the SDL2 library
   - It now supports the distance widget in VR
   - It now support cell data probing from within VR
   - It supports navigation panel in VR showing location and bearing
   - It loads/saves recorded camera poses into the PV state file
   - Includes a new Menu Widget that provides an easy API for adding menus
   and submenus into VR.
   - Includes optional floating labels for controller buttons


These changes reflect a lot of work from Lucas Gandel, Jc Fillion-Robin and
Jean-Baptiste Vimort as well as generous support from our commercial and
federal customers.

You can find a windows executable at the paraview download page and a
direct link here

https://www.paraview.org/paraview-downloads/download.php?submit=Download&version=v5.4&type=binary&os=Windows&downloadFile=ParaView-OpenVR-Windows-64bit.zip

And over the next few weeks we hope to get a nightly release with Python
started that includes OpenVR support as well.

Please let me know if you run into issues, have contributions, or would
like to talk about future work/extensions.

Thanks!
Ken

Hi all,
I modified my data file to same as residual.dat you send.
But still it cannot be read in Paraview.
If I change it into .txt file, then it can be read but there is only one
column.
Best,

the actual function seem to retain the default settings.  I am using
the standard Linux 64-bit download version of ParaView 5.4.1.

ParaView on Linux, 5.4.1, local server.  I just tried changing all three buttons to Pan, and all three buttons only did Pan.  Next, I tried resetting to default, and this also worked.

Try moving (or deleting) your ~/.config/ParaView/* files?

All,

I have a Paraview plugin which works in v4.4 but gives an error message (attached) in v5.4.1 (both Linux).

Did we add some assertions in the dot routine, or did we switch from the native numpy dot to a vtk implementation.

I am not at liberty to release the plugin to the general public, but it basically transforms global Cartesian strains into cylindrical coordinate strains.

Any ideas?

Message-ID: <7F781841FF1E044388AFA42B70703A7AE7F4F1D4@CHIMBX6.ad.uillinois.edu>

Hi ParaView,

Is it possible to get at the individual particles generated by ParticleTracer? I've been handed a mesh with a velocity field and an implied particle sink. I'd like to delete any particles that wander within a certain radius of that sink. My thought was if I could get at the array holding the particles I could check each distance and delete as necessary.

Thanks,
Mark

Yes, in 2014, I added a dot function that is better suited to what folks
expect out of ParaView (do a dot of each vector on each point or cell). If
you want the numpy.dot, you can do:

import numpy
numpy.dot(a,b)

rather than just
dot(a,b)

In general, I would recommend not ever doing from numpy import * and always
using the numpy.XXX form.

Hi,

as soon as I select a dataset to colorize pvpython stops working (see

I use the latest 5.4.1 windows 64bit pv.

This happens with all example datasets.

Subject: [Paraview] Loading cell data from a netcdf file in ParaView
Message-ID: <02fcce0c-6021-07e4-4841-c06e316617fc@gmail.com>

Hi all,

A quick request for some help loading cell data from a netcdf file in ParaView.

I'm using the "NetCDF files generic and CF conventions" reader under ParaView 5.2.0 (the x86_64 linux build you can download off the website).  I believe I've followed the CF cell conventions, but it insists on load the data as point data.

http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.7/build/ch07.html

Any help would be appreciated.  Here's the relevant details from the file and a link to it

netcdf Pressure.mat {

          x = 10 ;
          y = 4 ;

          double b(b) ;
          double x_bnds(x, b) ;
          double y_bnds(y, b) ;
          double z_bnds(z, b) ;
          double pressure(time, z, y, x) ;

Thanks!  -Tyson

PS:  From playing with other netcdf files I found online, it almost seems to me that ParaView only honors the cell structure when you are in spherical coordinates.  Is cell data just not supported in cartesian coordinates?

Hi Mathieu,

The full science context is, this is a simulation of a binary black hole system. The way the solver works, the black hole locations aren?t actually in the mesh, they?re stored as separate coordinates with an associated radius. The black holes orbit each other during the simulation, creating turbulence in the plasma (and magnetic field). I made a few videos of particles being advected by the plasma velocity. This was basically just the mesh, a seed source, and a Particle Tracer filter. This works fine, except that particles which get within the radius of each black hole end up coagulating and behaving non-physically. If I understand the scientist right, in the simulation itself, they are able to handle this somehow correctly, but that behavior doesn?t get translated to what?s saved in the mesh.

That?s part 1. Part 2 of the vis, and this works, is that the plasma advected particles are used as seeds for streamlines through the magnetic field -- though there are streamlines coming out of non-physically correct particles.

What I?d like is to be able to check of each of the actual particle locations vs the black hole locations and radii and if they?re within that radii, delete them (or hide them, make them transparent, whatever.)  I was hoping this was something I could do with a programmable filter, but I?m open to any suggestions, including hacking on VTK source.

Hi ParaView,

Is it possible to get at the individual particles generated by ParticleTracer? I?ve been handed a mesh with a velocity field and an implied particle sink. I?d like to delete any particles that wander within a certain radius of that sink. My thought was if I could get at the array holding the particles I could check each distance and delete as necessary.

Thanks,
Mark

Hello

Simplest way to go would be to add a Python Programmable Filter after the
particle tracer, that process each point and does not copy it when it is
too far from an arbitrary point.
This would work, even with paraview release, but will not be so most
efficient implementation.

Harder way to go would be to copy(or inherit) the ParticleTracer as a new
vtk filter and associated xml proxy plugin. And add a radius check in the
code, probably in vtkParticleTracerBase::RequestData:1188

            // if the particle is sent, remove it from the list
-            if
(this->SendParticleToAnotherProcess(info,previous,this->OutputPointData))
+            if
(this->SendParticleToAnotherProcess(info,previous,this->OutputPointData) ||
!yourRadiusTest(point2))
            {
              this->ParticleHistories.erase(it);
              particle_good = false;
             }

much more efficient but you will need to know C++ and how to compile
ParaView and a ParaView plugin.

Best,

Mathieu Westphal

Zhen,

Seems like the pvserver process is segfaulting/aborting. When does it
happen, as soon as the client connects or after someone steps? It hard to
gauge what could be going on. Is it possible for you to do a "debug" build
of ParaView on your cluster and then run through gdb? If can get the
callstack for the crash, we will have some clues.

Hi Simon,


The ability to enable CUDA support in the ParaViewSuperbuild has been
added. You will need to have the latest superbuild, and enable
`ENABLE_cuda` for support to be added.

Hmm, this is very odd. I don't know why libarpack would be loaded. It
looks like something is loading it and libarpack does not like the
libgfortran that ships with ParaView.

If you are familiar with gdb, could you run pvpython through gdb and
get a stack trace where libarpack is being loaded?

Thanks,
Cory

It was probably not back ported to the release branch of 5.4 when Aron
fixed it.

I can confirm that the bug still exists on Windows with the ParaView 5.4.1
binaries downloaded from paraview.org.

To fix it, you can do a little patch to your installation of ParaView.

In the file
{ParaViewInstallDir}\bin\Lib\site-packages\paraview\web\protocols.py,
around line 1070, add these two lines:

        # Use the vtk data encoder to base-64 encode the image as png,
using no compression
        encoder = vtkDataEncoder()
+        # two calls in a row crash on Windows - bald timing hack to avoid
the crash.
+        time.sleep(0.01);
        b64Str = encoder.EncodeAsBase64Png(imgData, 0)

This should get you going again!
Regards,
Aron

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView session state
Message-ID: <feeb1f2cef1719da9b7dbcfdd84d1f7c@berrocal.info>

Hello list,

Where is the data structure(s) in the code where all the objects for the state of a particular ParaView session are kept while it is running?. I have been reading the code, and I think it should be in the "internals" of vtkSMSessionProxyManager, but I am unsure. As far as I understand, the state (which can be saved to XML) is all it takes to recreate a session (Am I right here? Probably you need the input data as well, right?).

Thanks for the help!,
Eduardo.

P.S.: Are my emails going to SPAM? Can someone respond ("hi") to this email to confirm otherwise? Thanks !.

Hi Robert,

Thank you for your email. We will pull that and start using that going 
forward.

We have a system with Tesla P100 and Joe had to manually change the CUDA 
library detection to get the compile going. Do you know anyone that was 
successful in getting the compilation going on system with Tesla P100 hardware 
without modifying the build script? Thank you.

thanks
-simon

Hi Simon,


The ability to enable CUDA support in the ParaViewSuperbuild has been added. 
You will need to have the latest superbuild, and enable `ENABLE_cuda` for 
support to be added.

Hi Eduardo,
I think you've basically got it, but the state is more complicated than you
think. Basically everything has a vtkSMProxy, and those proxies contain the
state of the pipeline, representation, and views. Anything that is modified
from the defaults gets saved in the state file. The vtkSMSessionProxyManager
is the root of a session, as you've found.
The input data is saved in the state file as absolute paths, and you do
need the input data. When you read state, it has that intelligent option to
search for the data files in another directory...

I've just been learning this stuff trying to add dynamic lights to
ParaView, so hopefully I'm close :)

HTH, Regards,
Aron

Hello list,

Where is the data structure(s) in the code where all the objects for the state of a particular ParaView session are kept while it is running?. I have been reading the code, and I think it should be in the "internals" of vtkSMSessionProxyManager, but I am unsure. As far as I understand, the state (which can be saved to XML) is all it takes to recreate a session (Am I right here? Probably you need the input data as well, right?).

Thanks for the help!,

Hi Siming,

Please reply-all to keep the discussion on the list so others may
participate and benefit.

This line in your export code is a problem:

sgrid->GetCellData()->AddArray(probe->GetOutput()->GetPointData()->GetArray(i));

Point and cell data arrays have different lengths for structured
grids. The writer is apparently not catching this, but the reader is.

Hi Aron and all,

Following this discussion....

For what I can see, all the session state is stored in a variable called "State" inside Internals of vtkSMSessionProxyManager (vtkSMSessionProxyManagerInternals). This State is of type vtkSMMessage, which is a typedef of paraview_protobuf::Message.

In other words, the state of the whole session is stored as a generated protobuf class (or package), which is defined in vtkPVMessage.proto. I guess this make sense as -- I image -- this makes read/write from a flat XML much easier (as well as transferring from client-to-server and vice versa). It would be great if someone with more knowledge on these details can clarify that I am in fact correct...

Cheers,
Eduardo.

 Hi Eduardo,
I think you've basically got it, but the state is more complicated than you think. Basically everything has a vtkSMProxy, and those proxies contain the state of the pipeline, representation, and views. Anything that is modified from the defaults gets saved in the state file. The vtkSMSessionProxyManager is the root of a session, as you've found.  
The input data is saved in the state file as absolute paths, and you do need the input data. When you read state, it has that intelligent option to search for the data files in another directory... 
I've just been learning this stuff trying to add dynamic lights to ParaView, so hopefully I'm close :) 
HTH, Regards,

Hello list,

Where is the data structure(s) in the code where all the objects for the state of a particular ParaView session are kept while it is running?. I have been reading the code, and I think it should be in the "internals" of vtkSMSessionProxyManager, but I am unsure. As far as I understand, the state (which can be saved to XML) is all it takes to recreate a session (Am I right here? Probably you need the input data as well, right?).

Thanks for the help!,
Eduardo.

P.S.: Are my emails going to SPAM? Can someone respond ("hi") to this email to confirm otherwise? Thanks !.

Subject: [Paraview] XDMF Version 2 and 3 Differences
Message-ID: <97E05A28-EE0C-4A11-B1B2-41309BD5F4B4@bluequartz.net>

Where might I find the differences between XDMF version 2 and 3? Our project writes a .xdmf file along side our HDF5 file so that ParaView can visualize the data. Ever since ParaView version 5.x was released with the XDMF 3 included we always have to select the "XDMF Writer" when opening the file. If we select the either of the XDMF 3 writers no data is loaded. I was wanting to figure out if there is something we need to adjust in our XDMF files so that the XDMF 3 readers work correctly with our data/files.

Thanks

Subject: [Paraview] Force or deactivate some Readers. Reuse the Paraview
	already running
Message-ID: <CAJbHkX9izHBET8BVWc3UZe3KB4sXU8YmiiXW7zWw+YEt5ZyqPA@mail.gmail.com>

I already put this in a feature request, but I dont know if someone is
interested:

1) I always work with xmdf files and every time I have to choose the reader
to use in the menu, can we deactivate or force the use of a specific reader
in the command line?

I know a can change the extension of my file and creates a plugin (100%
xml) to use this new extension with my preferred reader. but I was thinking
something  more at the app level (not a hack).

2) also if I run a second command line to run paraview (with a filename as
argument) can we reuse the instance of paraview already running. (to
compare results for example)

Any idea of how to solve this

Not currently, but that's a nice and easy feature to add. Feel free to
report a feature request.

Not currently supported also, I am afraid.

Subject: [Paraview] Remote rendering through reverse SSH breaks with a GLX
	error
Message-ID: <20170928154348.GA17161@avignon>

Dear Paraviewers,

I am trying to run Paraview in a client-server mode on a remote compute node
using a reverse SSH through the login node.

I have successfully worked out my port forwarding skulduggery and was able to
connect to a host which does NOT run X server. Inside my local client. I do get
an error

        "Display is not accessible on the server side. Remote rendering
        will be disabled"
        
This is to be expected on the node without X.

On the node with X running my client gets connected but then breaks with:

        Waiting for client...
        Connection URL: cs://pgc104:22226
        Accepting connection(s): pgc104:22226
        Client connected.
        Xlib:  extension "GLX" missing on display ":0.0".
        Xlib:  extension "GLX" missing on display ":0.0".
        ...
        (core dumped)


Finally on the login node client-server works fine and rendering (I guess)
is done on the remote side as I don't get any errors. We have made sure that
xorg.conf on login and X-enabled compute node are the same.


My connection procedure:

local% ssh -L 22226:localhost:22226 login_node
login% bsub -R "select[hname=pgc104]" -Is /bin/bash
pgc104% ssh -N -R 22226:localhost:22226 login &
pgc104% DISPLAY=:0.0 pvserver -sp=22226 --use-offscreen-rendering
local% paraview->connect to localhost:22226

Same thing works on pgc304 which doesn't run X. Please let us know if you have
any suggestions.

Best wishes,
Robert

Subject: [Paraview] Coprocessing with many time steps
Message-ID: <CAKx9aErznR0_uKgQPUs9a4tjdBRkqbO_XPDjazwhKnYsP_9qcw@mail.gmail.com>

I have doubt about using paraview catalyst from my simulation code. Suppose
I created a simple Paraview pipeline containing the TemporalStatistics
filter only.

Initially, it is not clear for which "dummy" source is adequate for the
script. I used a simple programmable source or even a unstructured cell
types source to create the python script. Then, I call the script from
catalyst in my code like this:

for each time step
    update grid;
    create data description;
    call coprocessing method;

The problem is that I expect the TemporalStatistics filter to create a
single file containing the statistics for all the time steps. However, this
approach creates a file for every time step. What I should do in the
catalyst (or during the script creation) to have a single output for this
filter.

Thanks in advance.

Hi,

The TemporalStatistics filter (or any other filter that iterates through
time steps) doesn't currently work with Catalyst. We hope to change this in
the future but because of the way that the ParaView pipeline works it makes
it a non-trivial change.

Ohh I see...

Just another quick question. Currently, I am creating a series of VTU and
VTI files whose names follow the pattern mysimulation-t%d. With %d being
replaced by an integer index identifying the time step. I am about to code
a simple PVD writer to consolidate the output and also to assign the real
time step value in seconds instead of maintaining this integer index.

It doesn't seem to be very hard to create this PVD file by hand, but I was
just wondering if there is something in the VTK library that could
automatically create these files for me. I still could not understand how I
can assign the real time step in seconds to a file, don't know if its even
possible with VT? files. If this is possible, some directions that could
help me implement that would be very nice!

Thanks once again!

Hi,

The XML readers and writers don't properly support time so currently the
best way would be to create a pvd file which would contain the time and
time step information. I don't know of anything in VTK or ParaView that
writes out pvd files (I only see a vtkPVDReader in ParaView) but the format
is meant to be simple. I would suggest doing it directly in the Catalyst
Python script through some Python library as the best workaround for now.

Dear ParaView developer,

This is my very 1st mail to this list (and thus a test), and a report about a
broken link here: https://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView#Developers_Corner

Clicking on https://public.kitware.com/mailman/subscribe/paraview-developers
results in 403 Permission Denied, maybe due to missing credentials. If so, a
hint about this would be helpful.

Have a nice day,

Paul

Subject: [Paraview] "Reload Files" Hotkey Acting on Individual Items ---
	Expected?
Message-ID: <CAAGOGw_EJLYN2S6EcSN8Z=9K_0CtSX8Qt0t7ffve=tGuc8bw4w@mail.gmail.com>

Colleagues:

In the File menu I would expect that the "Reload Files (F5)" command would
apply to all items in the pipeline browser rather than the one currently
selected or last acted on.  For individual reloading, I would expect to
need to use the right-click approach to "Reload Files."  However, this does
not seem to be the case.  If I open multiple, independent, data files that
I want to plot together, I must select each one in the pipeline browser and
reload it (either via F5 or right-clicking) to see changes.

Am I correct that the "reload files" hotkey only applies to the currently
selected or last used item (a file or collection of time-series files) in
the pipeline browser?  If so, is there a method to reload all items in the
pipeline browser (ideally avoiding the need to select all the files)?  If
not, can this be added as an enhancement request (e.g., menu item/hotkey
for Reload All Files)?

I'm using ParaView 5.4.1 in OS X 10.11.6.

Please contact me with any comments, questions, or concerns.

Thank you,
Joel

Subject: [Paraview] Windows MPI capable Paraview binary install package
	question
Message-ID: <1506721617.3407.3.camel@lanl.gov>

Hello gang,

  We're attempting to deploy the PV-5.4.1 Windows client via the SCCM
utility on our systems here at LANL. Our SCCM team deployed the MPI-
enabled version for user installation. Early testers are encountering
an error message regarding a missing "msmpi.dll" library.  I'm
suspecting that this particular build of PV is making use of
Microsoft's MPI library/SDK?

If so, I'll simply have our SCCM team deploy the non-MPI capable PV.
Given that the common use case will be to use the PV GUI for a client-
server connection to our HPC platforms, having a locally MPI-capable
ParaView is likely overkill.

Polite feedback is appreciated :-)

Thanks!

Yes, that is correct.

That will work. Otherwise they would need to deploy Microsoft's MPI
library as well.

Thanks,

Hey Giovanni,

We publish two windows binaries for ParaView. The one without mpi in the
name doesn't need anything special to run. The other one depends on
microsofts mpi, which do not provide, but is available from microsoft for
free and is easy to install if you have the need.

Your suggested path of deploying the non-mpi one sounds best to me.

cheers!
