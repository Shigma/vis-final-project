Hello,

can anyone tell me if the following wiki article is valid? -> http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView:Texture
It is about exactly what I need to do, but I can't find the files mentioned in the last section "Affected Classes". How do I implement this for paraview 3.14?

Thanks for your help!
Sonja

I think the wiki is out of date for 3.14:
to use a texture in 3.14.

you must load you data (Sources -> Sphere, for example), then apply a 
filter to generate texture coordinates. (filters->TexturemaptoSphere for 
example ), you can use cylinder of plane is you want.

Then you have to load the texture. in the display tab-> apply texture -> 
load.
and finally select solid color to show the texture

Merci for your answer, but it doesn't really solve my problem... 
I have a file series of textures (jpeg) and would like to map them on a sphere and use the animation feature of paraview. Any ideas how to do this?

Subject: [Paraview] Step interpolation in keyframes via Python?
Message-ID: <4F4F9866.8020402@mkasu.org>

Hello,

I am trying to write a python script for a project where I need to 
animate stuff. When doing it manually, I usually use the Step 
interpolation feature between keyframes. How do I get such a behaviour 
with a Python skript? I tried following code snipplet in Python shell:

keyframe = CompositeKeyFrame()
keyframe.Interpolation = 'Step' (This attribute is default 'Ramp' so I 
thought this would work)

But it says: "ValueError: Step is not a valid value.".

Thanks in advance.

  Hi all

  I'm trying to compile this plugin.

  I got the sources from paraview git and compiled without problem

  I followed the steps to compile the plugin here:


https://hpcforge.org/plugins/mediawiki/wiki/pv-meshless/index.php/Download



  And I am finding this error related to the paraview build:

  is this an error with the current sources of paraview?

the example in vtk works well but without textures.

if a put a simple texture over the sphere the texture is in blank and 
white!!!

Why is there a difference between the GUI label and script label. Shouldn't they be consistent?

Matthias,

The default array that's getting picked to label the points is the
scalar "temperature" and hence the values are shown as doubles. The
constant value seems to be due to the nature of the dataset and the
current selection. Try changing the label array to Point ID from the
selection inspector panel to see the ids.

Can you try reproducing with 3.14.0 and using a default reader e..g
opening disk_out_ref.ex2? I tried with 3.14.0 and doing something
similar with disl_out_ref.ex2 and had no issues loading the calculated

Subject: [Paraview] labeled image contouring
Message-ID: <CAHoiV3YvD0noHbWH_OD3o-ts7j_47_T2MwDs9LGMznUD9YK2DQ@mail.gmail.com>

I have a labeled image of a segmented tissue sample,
each nucleus with its unique label from 1 to N, saved
in mhd format. I've been using VTK to visualize my
tissue successfully using the following example
http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK/Examples/Cxx/Medical/GenerateCubesFromLabels

I want to do is to the same in paraview,
but I cannot seem to find how to do so. I've
seen some suggestions about using threshold
and calculator filters, but I did not understand
how to perform this step by step. Is there a
document that you can suggest ?

Thank you,
Cagatay

If you're using Python scripting exclusively, then you can indeed
directly use matplotlib or any other Pyhton modules for generating
plots. However if you want those plots to be rendered in the ParaView
GUI or on tile-displays, etc. then you want to use ParaView's plots.
For that can use the Calculator or Python Calculator to compute the
derived quantity then apply the "Plot Data" filter to plot the arrays
in plots.

Message-ID: <727687F5F3B9A04DBBDA3C77DF486B7E06DAF4@VCEXC01.victorchang.edu.au>

Hi all,

My group has just started using ParaView in an attempt to visualise the output of an open-source application we are using. The app outputs a single .vtu file which has multiple arrays, each representing the data at every time step of the simulation. I cannot animate this as it does not have any time information. I could not find the solution online and nor could I find any documentation for the python scripting. I tried that figuring that if I could seperate the vtu into multiple (ie. 0.vtu, 1.vtu, etc) then I could automatically produce animations.
Does anyone know how this can be achieved?

And, more generally, how can one go about learning ParaView scripting? I don't mind what language I have to use, I just want a comprehensive guide and documentation. I tried buying the book, but it is out of stock.

Thanks,
Stefano

Hope this could give you more insight... The trace can help you
convert UI interaction into script which can be manually tweaked for

Hi Sebastien,

Thank you for your recommendations.
I have already been through all those resources and I was not able to extract very much useful information from them. The the 'trace' suggestion seems promising. I can't quite get it to do what I want, but I'm sure it'll prove useful in the future.

This is what using the trace gave me:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
try: paraview.simple
except: from paraview.simple import *
paraview.simple._DisableFirstRenderCameraReset()

a3dResults_vtu = XMLUnstructuredGridReader( FileName=['/home/stefano/workspace/TestSimulations/3dpropagation/output/vtk_output/3dResults.vtu'] )
a3dResults_vtu.PointArrayStatus = ['V_000000', 'V_000001', 'V_000002', 'V_000003', 'V_000004', 'V_000005']

# From here, I don't even know how to do what I want to do manually
# At this point if I am in Paraview and I hit 'Animate' then it will animate V_00000 only. But, in fact, V_000000 is timestep 0 of V, V_000001 is timestep 1 of V, etc...
# So I essentially want it to either interpret the arrays as such or output a series of vtu files which I can then hopefully open 'together' (output*.vtu) and animate that...?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Also. I would still like to know where I can look up the functionality of, for example, paraview.simple, for the future.

Stefano

All,

I worked out the issue with ParaView and narrowed it down to the fact that
the ParaView client was launching the pvservers with it's own environment.
As ParaView was running through VirtualGL, all the servers used the same
rendering libraries (which were faked by VirtualGL). I solved the problem by
saving the needed variable when ParaView client starts...

LD_PRELOAD_SAVE=$LD_PRELOAD
LD_PRELOAD=
export LD_PRELOAD
vglrun paraview

Then I reload it before I start the servers...

echo "reloading non-virtualgl environment" $LD_PRELOAD_SAVE
LD_PRELOAD=$LD_PRELOAD_SAVE
export LD_PRELOAD
mpirun ... blah blah blah

This is now implemented in our 3.14.0  config and I am now see ~2 FPS with a
10G dataset on a single node :) e.g. below from timing log

Local Process
Interactive Render,  0.062107 seconds
Interactive Render,  0.05679 seconds
...
Still Render,  0.433776 seconds
Interactive Render,  0.08851 seconds
Interactive Render,  0.080116 seconds
...
Still Render,  0.435925 seconds

Cheers,

Paul

Hi,

Is any one out there using ParaView client through VirtualGL and using the
default_server config?

I notice that if I launch the command below from within ParaView I only see
1 or 2 GPU's getting used (looking at load). If I run it outside of ParaView
then both GPU's have load. I am running ParaView client through VirtualGL,
and "glxinfo -display :0" (called from ParaView) sees both GPUs on the node 

mpirun -v -hostfile $PBS_NODEFILE -bynode -np 6
/usr/local/$APPLICATION/$VERSION/bin/pvserver --server-port=11112 -display
:0.1 : -np 6 /usr/local/$APPLICATION/$VERSION/bin/pvserver -display :0.0

This is both a heads up and a question - obviously I see much faster
rendering when both GPUs are used ;)

Cheers,

Paul

Hi Stefano,

In addition to the good suggestions by Sebastien, you can get more information for each Python object using the following approaches:

Let's say your object is called 'obj'

1. Get help:

help(obj)

2. You can list all its attributes (properties & functions) using:

dir(obj)

or, better readable

for element in dir(obj):
    print element

3. Then, if your object is a SourceProxy (maybe even if it's a Proxy, I'm not sure), you can list its properties like so:

for p in obj.ListProperties():
    print p, obj.GetProperty(p)

4. Lastly, in the help on an object you can sometimes see that not all documentation is provided and you are referred to a vtk* object. Download the source code from ParaView and view the type header file to see the full information.

Good luck,

Menno

Matthias,

The default array that's getting picked to label the points is the scalar "temperature" and hence the values are shown as doubles. The constant value seems to be due to the nature of the dataset and the current selection. Try changing the label array to Point ID from the selection inspector panel to see the ids.

Hi Menno,

Thanks for that info!

Up to now I had looking at the C function headers and trying to guess the Python calls!

Hi Stefano,

In addition to the good suggestions by Sebastien, you can get more information for each Python object using the following approaches:

Let's say your object is called 'obj'

1. Get help:

help(obj)

2. You can list all its attributes (properties & functions) using:

dir(obj)

or, better readable

for element in dir(obj):
    print element

3. Then, if your object is a SourceProxy (maybe even if it's a Proxy, I'm not sure), you can list its properties like so:

for p in obj.ListProperties():
    print p, obj.GetProperty(p)

4. Lastly, in the help on an object you can sometimes see that not all documentation is provided and you are referred to a vtk* object. Download the source code from ParaView and view the type header file to see the full information.

Good luck,

Menno

Hi Sebastien,

Thank you for your recommendations.
I have already been through all those resources and I was not able to extract very much useful information from them. The the 'trace' suggestion seems promising. I can't quite get it to do what I want, but I'm sure it'll prove useful in the future.

This is what using the trace gave me:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
try: paraview.simple
except: from paraview.simple import *
paraview.simple._DisableFirstRenderCameraReset()

a3dResults_vtu = XMLUnstructuredGridReader( FileName=['/home/stefano/workspace/TestSimulations/3dpropagation/output/vtk_output/3dResults.vtu'] )
a3dResults_vtu.PointArrayStatus = ['V_000000', 'V_000001', 'V_000002', 'V_000003', 'V_000004', 'V_000005']

# From here, I don't even know how to do what I want to do manually
# At this point if I am in Paraview and I hit 'Animate' then it will animate V_00000 only. But, in fact, V_000000 is timestep 0 of V, V_000001 is timestep 1 of V, etc...
# So I essentially want it to either interpret the arrays as such or output a series of vtu files which I can then hopefully open 'together' (output*.vtu) and animate that...?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Also. I would still like to know where I can look up the functionality of, for example, paraview.simple, for the future.

Stefano

Hi Stefano,

you can give a look at http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView and more precisely on:

http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView#Python_Scripting
http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Python_Scripting
http://paraview.org/Wiki/Python_GUI_Tools

Hope this could give you more insight... The trace can help you
convert UI interaction into script which can be manually tweaked for
your custom purpose.

Hello,

I have a set of volumes named in a sequential way and loaded as a 
time-varying data. I also have simple text file with a set of numbers 
assigned to each of the volume (e.g. csv with just one column and number 
of rows corresponds to the number of volumes). During animation I want 
text with data from file be drawn over 3D view. Just like Annotate time, 
but instead of time there should be numbers taken from file.
Can someone point me to the right direction?
Thanks in advance.

Hi Stefano,

the mapping between the c++ and the proxies in python are not straight
forward, basically there is some XML file that explicitly define that
property/method mapping but if you have the code you could look at the
file ParaView/src/Utilities/VTKPythonWrapping/paraview/simple.py,
then the rest is Proxy specific.

One more thing, I still don't understand what you try to do in
python... D you want to switch from one data array to another ? Or ?

Thanks,

Seb

That's an interesting problem. Try looking at the implementation of
the vtkTimeToTextConvertor filter. You will need to write a new
vtkTableToTextConvertor as a plugin to achieve a similar effect.

When you write the XML definition for this filter., don't forget to
add the following hint so that ParaView knows it treat it as producing
text:

 <Hints>
       <OutputPort name="Output-0" index="0" type="text" />
 </Hints>

Look at the TimeToTextConvertorSource xml definition under
ParaViewCore/ServerImplementation/Resources/sources.xml

Utkarsh,

Thanks for response.
I'm afraid "You will need to write a new vtkTableToTextConvertor as a 
plugin"  sounds a bit desperate to me since I'm not well familiar with 
ParaView source code and plug-in system.
However I find this task pretty general and surprised there is no such 
functionality.

Can you or somebody else in the list guide me a bit concerning plugins?

Andrew,

I may have missed something in the discussion, but you typically do
not want to set colors via SetVectors as you mentioned (
p->GetPointData()->SetVectors(rgb); )

My understanding is that whatever is set with SetVectors will be
transformed when the data set is transformed. I.e. if you rotate the
data set, the colors will change (not typically what you'd want).

I think you should prefer
p->GetPointData()->SetScalars(rgb);

Hi David,
    Interesting, I just checked this out using ParaView and you are correct
if a transform filter is applied. However in the display tab of ParaView if
you transform there then the colouring is unaffected. Never noticed this
because we have been just transforming using the transform in the display
tab of ParaView.

I agree with you is will be safer to  prefer
p->GetPointData()->SetScalars(rgb);


Thanks

Andrew

Thanks Sebastien.

I compiled from source and so I'll look in simple.py. 

When I open the VTU I can see that it has N arrays in there. If I try to create an animation, it only uses the first array. But, each array corresponds to a different timestep, so it should loop through them to animate correctly.
And so I'm trying to write some sort of python script which will either fix the VTU (eg. Add timestep data to the xml) or do the necessary sequence of actions to produce an animation involving all the arrays. 

Stefano

Hi Stefano,

the mapping between the c++ and the proxies in python are not straight
forward, basically there is some XML file that explicitly define that
property/method mapping but if you have the code you could look at the
file ParaView/src/Utilities/VTKPythonWrapping/paraview/simple.py,
then the rest is Proxy specific.

One more thing, I still don't understand what you try to do in
python... D you want to switch from one data array to another ? Or ?

Thanks,

Seb

So the trace should tell you how to activate a new array name. Based
on that piece of code, you should be able to loop over your array
names  in a script...

Ricardo

pv-meshless has undergone a number of big changes recently and I need to update the wiki, the problem you're seeing is caused by some changes in the paraview API between 3.10, 3.12 and now 3.14 if you use the "testing" branch of pv-meshless, it should compile against paraview from git. 

The testing branch will become the pv3.14 branch and I'll update the wiki accordingly. The testing branch contains a whole bunch of stuff for doing parallel work with pv-meshless. It has now completed the "testing" phase and is stable so ready for release. (hopefully)

  Hi all

  I'm trying to compile this plugin.

  I got the sources from paraview git and compiled without problem

  I followed the steps to compile the plugin here:


https://hpcforge.org/plugins/mediawiki/wiki/pv-meshless/index.php/Download



  And I am finding this error related to the paraview build:

  is this an error with the current sources of paraview?

Hi.

I'm now using ParaView v3.12.0 on Mac OS X 10.7.3.
Input model is solved by Finite Volume Method (CFD) solver.

When we visualize flow vector, we can use Glyph command.
There are some options in "Scale Mode".
But I don't understand the meaning of "vector" and "vector_components".

If I choose these options, I can get different results.
The vectors' lengths are different, and besides some vectors generated
for opposite directions.
How do I understand those results?

Would someone kindly tell me how to compute the axis-aligned bounding 
box of an object with Python.

Thanks,

Hi,

Is it possible to control the speed of the camera? As far as I can
see, it always follows the defined path with a constant velocity.

Hi All,

I was wondering,
How I can flip a vtk (a simple surface which saved as a vtk file) with
Paraview's gui?

Thanks!

I have taken the testing branch of pv-meshless with (repeating all the

you have compiled paraview with hdf5 serial, you need to use hdf5 parallel. sorry. (rerun ccmake in paraview build dir and turn on hdf5 enable parallel). If you are using system hdf5, then you need it compiled with parallel support.

Don't wipe any build directories, it takes too long to rebuild everything from scratch.

I'll add this stuff to the wiki so the next person doesn't have the same trouble (though I thought it was already there for the hdf5 stuff)

Hello.

I think that the right scale mode for arrow glyph should be "vector": in 
this mode, the glyph (the arrow) would be scaled according to the vector 
magnitude while it remains aligned with the vector.

I am not sure but I think that the scale mode "vector components" means 
that each component of the glyph would be scaled according to the same 
component of the vector, so the arrow would be deformed and may not have 
the same orientation as the vector. But if you choose a sphere instead 
of an arrow, the sphere would become an ellipse with its greatest axis 
aligned with the vector.

  About the error I'm finding I got checked this report in the gcc-4.6 bug 
list.

  http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=47390

  So

  -Wl,--export-dynamic

  will disapear. I have tried, has recommended -rdynamic (says it doesn't 
exist) or -Wl,-export-dynamic but the version I have still hasn't the bug 
mentioned in the above link solved.

  I seems I have to revert to a previous compiler.

  Hope this helps someone.

  best,

Message-ID: <CAOVFbFjuQMDgjsUiCw_DuC4jijf-ULXLxEKeehmWOYkdOx1hew@mail.gmail.com>

I'm wondering if anybody has seen the following error (at runtime) with the
current master (3.14) on a 64 bit Ubuntu machine:

paraview: symbol lookup error: /paraview-3.14/libQVTK.so.pv3.14: undefined
symbol:
_ZN19QAbstractProxyModel11setItemDataERK11QModelIndexRK4QMapIi8QVariantE

It looks like a c++ symbox, but I can't tell from the name mangling whether
it's a VTK derived class from Qt or a Qt symbol.  I have installed the Qt
SDK (4.8). Maybe I need to be using just a system wide Qt library install?

Here's some more info on the machine:

I haven't seen that myself, nor do I know what might cause it, but I
do know that "c++filt" will demangle symbols for you.

vector_components uses 1 component of the vector to scale. Currently
it only uses 0th component (i.e. X component). I believe the panel is
missing a widget to pick other components.

By argument, you mean as an input dataset? You'll have to create a
vtk-dataset (vtkTable) using the array. I believe there are examples
on the Wiki how to do that. Let me know if you cannot find them, and I
can fish them out for you.

Thank you for this information, Utkarsh.
I did not make many tests with this "vector_components" option and I was 
not sure if it was scaling according to one or three components.
I was always using the default "Vector" option that is the good one to 
plot velocity fields with arrow glyph.

Subject: [Paraview] Multipiece Structured Dataset questions
Message-ID: <4F54E841.3070501@bu.edu>


Hello all,

I am attempting to develop a Paraview plugin to read in parallel a 
multipiece structured dataset through a custom I/O library. Since our 
data is already broken up into pieces it would be nice to use a grid 
type which has a DATA_EXTENT_TYPE of VTK_PIECES_EXTENT, otherwise when 
using VTK_3D_EXTENT extra code will need to be created to calculate and 
subtract sub-extents such as seen in vtkXMLPStructuredDataReader. There 
are three different options I am considering for developing this reader:

1) Use an Unstructured Grid

Simply translate our structured grid into a vtkUnstructuredGrid using 
Hexahedron cells. Will unstructured grids be as efficient as structured 
grids for operations such as cut planes and streamlines, or are there 
any efficiency disadvantages to using unstructured grids in general?

2) Subclass Structured Grid

Create a subclass of vtkStructuredGrid which uses has a DATA_EXTENT_TYPE 
of VTK_PIECES_EXTENT. Is this even feasible, or any other issues?

3) Use a Structured Grid

Just write the code to calculate and subtract 3d sub-extents, better 
than above options?


Any feedback or advice is greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
  -Erik

Burlen,

To give you an update, we have decided to put out a patch release
within the next week or so that should include the fix for this bug.

Utkarsh,

By the way, not a huge issue but I also had a problem with static builds 
when trying to enable the visit bridge. The visit bridge and the Point 
Sprite Pluign both had copies of some of the same code.

Yes, I believe we ran into that as well. Short of re-factoring the
PointSpritePlugin, the work around for now is to disable the
point-sprite plugin when using visit-bridge and static builds.

Sorry, misread your reply, sounds like you would prefer to keep 
visit-bridge on. But will you disabled point-sprite in the binary 
release? I noticed that when the client has it but server does not it 
causes a crash.

Erik,

I'd try 3, but instead of using sub extents (which I might have misunderstood what that implies), I'd use the TableExtentTranslator so that each piece is mapped to the already computed extents that you saved your data using.

Essentially, you already have a mapping between pieces and extents, you can set these up in the TableExtentTranslator and then when the downstream code requests extents, they'll be calculated based on the values you've setup. Even though the pipeline requests a structured VTK_3D_EXTENT from your reader, the values in that Extent are calculated based on the mpi rank (piece number), so by fooling it with a custom extent translator, all should work (note that I say should, because I've used my own custom extent translator, but not the table extent trans so I'm guessing - when Dave DeM reads this he'll either put us right, or possibly concur).

Subject: [Paraview] Multipiece Structured Dataset questions


Hello all,

I am attempting to develop a Paraview plugin to read in parallel a multipiece structured dataset through a custom I/O library. Since our data is already broken up into pieces it would be nice to use a grid type which has a DATA_EXTENT_TYPE of VTK_PIECES_EXTENT, otherwise when using VTK_3D_EXTENT extra code will need to be created to calculate and subtract sub-extents such as seen in vtkXMLPStructuredDataReader. There are three different options I am considering for developing this reader:

1) Use an Unstructured Grid

Simply translate our structured grid into a vtkUnstructuredGrid using Hexahedron cells. Will unstructured grids be as efficient as structured grids for operations such as cut planes and streamlines, or are there any efficiency disadvantages to using unstructured grids in general?

2) Subclass Structured Grid

Create a subclass of vtkStructuredGrid which uses has a DATA_EXTENT_TYPE of VTK_PIECES_EXTENT. Is this even feasible, or any other issues?

3) Use a Structured Grid

Just write the code to calculate and subtract 3d sub-extents, better than above options?


Any feedback or advice is greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
  -Erik

Hi,

I think we can fix this by modifying the PointSprite plugin to check to see
if the VisIt Bridge is enabled and to conditional building the conflicting
classes only when the Bridge is disabled or we can name mangle the VisIt
classes that the PointSprite plugin is building.

which stuff in the point sprite is causing trouble? I wanted to redo some of it because now that I know more of the internals of the pqXXX classes, there is some stuff that is a little obsolete in the PSPlugin.

Hi,

I think we can fix this by modifying the PointSprite plugin to check to see if the VisIt Bridge is enabled and to conditional building the conflicting classes only when the Bridge is disabled or we can name mangle the VisIt classes that the PointSprite plugin is building.

By the way, not a huge issue but I also had a problem with static builds
when trying to enable the visit bridge. The visit bridge and the Point
Sprite Pluign both had copies of some of the same code.

this and few other state file backwards compatibility related issues

Subject: [Paraview] 3.14 pvsc enumeration issues

Hi,

I've encountered bugs with pvsc enumerations in version 3.14.0. I
have
the attached pvsc that makes use of a couple of enumerations. After
connecting once w/ this pvsc, neither of the enums save the user's
choice in the GUI the next time the server is used. However they
seem
to
remember the user's last choice internally and always uses that
instead
of what the user has selected in the GUI. Neither setting save=false
or
removing the default attribute helps. I filed the bug report here.
http://paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=12969 If it's confirmed would
the
bug be fixed in another 3.14 release? or should I simply remove
enumerations from our pvsc's for 3.14?

Burlen

Sounds good to me. Or always mangle VisIt classes for PointSprite,
until we have time to fix the PointSprite plugin cleanly.

Since our data is already broken up into pieces it would be nice to use a grid type which has a DATA_EXTENT_TYPE of VTK_PIECES_EXTENT, otherwise when using VTK_3D_EXTENT extra code will need to be created to calculate and subtract sub-extents such as seen in vtkXMLPStructuredDataReader.

Thanks. These ones will be easy to fix. I'll have a crack at refactoring the PSplugin as soon as possible.

Hi,

I think we can fix this by modifying the PointSprite plugin to check to see if the VisIt Bridge is enabled and to conditional building the conflicting classes only when the Bridge is disabled or we can name mangle the VisIt classes that the PointSprite plugin is building.

Good, maybe it's something specific to my configuration although I
don't
have any idea what it could be off hand. Just to be sure: do you mean
that you haven't had noticed problems or that you've positively

that after using the enum once you could change the value?

Subject: [Paraview] 3.14 pvsc enumeration issues

Hi,

I've encountered bugs with pvsc enumerations in version 3.14.0. I
have
the attached pvsc that makes use of a couple of enumerations. After
connecting once w/ this pvsc, neither of the enums save the user's
choice in the GUI the next time the server is used. However they
seem
to
remember the user's last choice internally and always uses that
instead
of what the user has selected in the GUI. Neither setting save=false
or
removing the default attribute helps. I filed the bug report here.
http://paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=12969 If it's confirmed would
the
bug be fixed in another 3.14 release? or should I simply remove
enumerations from our pvsc's for 3.14?

Burlen

Message-ID: <4F55F26C.1020307@knmi.nl>

Hello Paraview users,

I'm using Paraview 3.10.1 and want to make movies. But it crashes after 
a while with error message as

"intel_bufmgr_gem.c:1054: Error mapping buffer 65077 (bufferobj): Cannot 
allocate memory ."

A few months ago I could make movies, don't know why suddenly not.

Who can give me a hint?

Thanks a lot!

Dear all,

I've been searching for a way to change the font size of the legend in an XY-chart. In the ParaView GUI you can't do this, but I was hoping that maybe from Python you can.

The XYChartView has the following properties:

AxisBehavior
AxisColor
AxisGridColor
AxisLabelColor
AxisLabelFont
AxisLabelNotation
AxisLabelPrecision
AxisLabelsBottom
AxisLabelsLeft
AxisLabelsRight
AxisLabelsTop
AxisLogScale
AxisRange
AxisTitle
AxisTitleColor
AxisTitleFont
CacheKey
ChartTitle
ChartTitleAlignment
ChartTitleColor
ChartTitleFont
ChartType
Representations
ShowAxis
ShowAxisGrid
ShowAxisLabels
ShowLegend  <--- use this to switch the legend on/off
UseCache
ViewPosition
ViewSize
ViewTime

I've looked at the properties of the XYChartRepresentation object in Python:

AttributeType
ChartType
CompositeDataSetIndex
ForceUseCache
ForcedCacheKey
Input
InternalInput1
SeriesNamesInfo
UseIndexForXAxis
Visibility
XArrayName
SeriesColor
SeriesColorInfo
SeriesLabel <--- this is the legend string
SeriesLabelInfo
SeriesLineStyle
SeriesLineStyleInfo
SeriesLineThickness
SeriesLineThicknessInfo
SeriesMarkerStyle
SeriesMarkerStyleInfo
SeriesPlotCorner
SeriesPlotCornerInfo
SeriesVisibility
SeriesVisibilityInfo

As you can see, there's no property on these two objects to change the SeriesLabelFont. Any clue how to change the font size of the legend of an XY chart?

Thanks and best wishes,

To Richard & Urkarsh


Thank you for your information.

I'm using other visualization tools (EnSight etc.) and those
'Vector Components' option may have additional [X, Y, Z] selector.
So I wondered why Paraview's vector_components option doesn't have
such an additional selector.

I expect to be added the function in the future release of ParaView.

But I think not so many users want to visualize vectors which scaled
by each component.
I also prefer to use vector magnitude... :P

Message-ID: <E47D2FE3-FD9E-4E92-8391-339F1C22754D@mac.com>

Hi.

I'm now using ParaView v3.12.0 and want to export
VTK transient data from my own postprocessors.
I'm familiar with EnSight Case format, so I'm trying
to study VTK format by importing EnSight-formatted data
and exporting in VTK format on ParaView.

EnSight Case format data has transient time values
in .case file.
My transient data has variable time steps, so I want to
remain original time values.

If I read the .case data on ParaView, I can find
these values at Information tab too.
But next I save this data in VTK Multi Block Files (.vtm) format
and reload it, the original time values seems to be removed.

Which is the best way to add the time values in VTK format?

Message-ID: <96B544848E12DC47B04606DAFF712749018D9FCAAD5D@exchange1.pc.mayahtt.ca>

Hello,

I have a series of particle data  files that I have written using the VTK XML PolyData file format (.vtp, I guess). I can use those to display the actual particles just fine with glyphs, but I'd like to also see a pathline being displayed for particles. I am therefore trying to use the 'Particle Pathline' filter.

The particles are simulated in a flow field, where new particles come in and older particles leave the system at every timestep. I therefore also have a 'point data' array called "ParticleID" which tags a unique ID to each particle (starting with a zero index). It is defined as such:

<PointData>
  <DataArray type="Int32" Name="ParticleID" NumberOfComponents="1" format="ascii">
    ...
  </DataArray>
... other arrays...
</PointData>

When I try to use this array as the "Id Channel Array" in the filter, however, I get no output whatsoever from the filter. I think the rest of the file is correct because the filter DOES generate pathlines when I leave the "Id Channel Filter" to "Global or Local IDs", but the paths get messed up as soon as some particles start leaving the domain (as they should, I guess).

What am I doing wrong? Do I need to define this 'ParticleID' array differently?

Thank you for your help,

Charles Boivin

You can use a pvd file to associate a time value with each vtm file like so:

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<VTKFile type="Collection" version="0.1">
  <Collection>
    <DataSet timestep="0" group="" part="0" file="foo_0.vtm"/>
    <DataSet timestep="0.5" group="" part="0" file="foo_1.vtm"/>
  </Collection>
</VTKFile>

It;s indeed just an oversight, with no real reason for it being
missing. As you noted, the use-case is so uncommon that no one has
noticed it since 3.0!

I just tested it on one of my particle datasets and it worked fine. Can you verify that your particle Ids are actually sensible? Use the spreadsheet view to manually inspect them.

Also check the max step distance isn't set very small (but I guess if other settings produce pathlines then it must be ok).

Even though the pipeline requests a structured VTK_3D_EXTENT from your reader, the values in that Extent are calculated based on the mpi rank (piece number), so by fooling it with a custom extent translator, all should work (note that I say should, because I've used my own custom extent translator, but not the table extent trans so I'm guessing - when Dave DeM reads this he'll either put us right, or possibly concur).

Hello,

Here's some feedback on the recent changes to the Download ParaView web
page at http://paraview.org/paraview/resources/software.php:  The links to
"latest stable" and "previous" are now broken.  Also, the drop-down combo
box is a bit of a hassle.  Typically, I navigate to the ParaView download
page, copy the download URL for the binaries I want to my clipboard.  Then,
I ssh into my computing resource & use wget to pull the binary to the
remote machine.  Now with the drop-down boxes, I can't do this.  Also,
these dropdowns don't seem to work in Lynx, so I have to first download the
binary locally & then SCP it via gateways to my remote host.

Definitely not the end of the world and I know that I'm being an
old curmudgeon, but figured you might want this feedback.

Cheers,
Pete

Thanks for the feedback.

The new form helps us get more accurate download counts. We will
definitely fix the bugs you pointed out, and will try to see what can
be done about the usability issues while maintaining the more accurate
accounting we now have.

Thanks for the suggestion.

It seems to be OK; however, I must correct what I was said before: the ParticleID variable start with a 1 index (not zero). Does that matter?

Should ParticleID be PointData or CellData? Does the way the polys are defined in the file matter here?

Thank you for your help!

I just tested it on one of my particle datasets and it worked fine. Can you verify that your particle Ids are actually sensible? Use the spreadsheet view to manually inspect them.

Also check the max step distance isn't set very small (but I guess if other settings produce pathlines then it must be ok).

Subject: [Paraview] Help with Particle Pathline filter...

Hello,

I have a series of particle data  files that I have written using the VTK XML PolyData file format (.vtp, I guess). I can use those to display the actual particles just fine with glyphs, but I'd like to also see a pathline being displayed for particles. I am therefore trying to use the 'Particle Pathline' filter.

The particles are simulated in a flow field, where new particles come in and older particles leave the system at every timestep. I therefore also have a 'point data' array called "ParticleID" which tags a unique ID to each particle (starting with a zero index). It is defined as such:

<PointData>
  <DataArray type="Int32" Name="ParticleID" NumberOfComponents="1" format="ascii">
    ...
  </DataArray>
... other arrays...
</PointData>

When I try to use this array as the "Id Channel Array" in the filter, however, I get no output whatsoever from the filter. I think the rest of the file is correct because the filter DOES generate pathlines when I leave the "Id Channel Filter" to "Global or Local IDs", but the paths get messed up as soon as some particles start leaving the domain (as they should, I guess).

What am I doing wrong? Do I need to define this 'ParticleID' array differently?

Thank you for your help,

Charles Boivin

Being 1 based shouldn't matter, it must be point data and not cell data.
If the particles are a single polyvertex of X points and not 1 point per cell then it might not work.
Try passing the particles through a maskpoints filter if they are a polyvertex and enable single point per vertex or whatever it's called..

Haaaa, got it. Thank you for your help; the spreadsheet view in particular was useful. It turns out the issue was with the 'Mask' setting in the filter... reading carefully what it expects, I realized I was totally wrong on what it was expecting and was therefore filtering pretty much everything.

Oops. Sorry for the inconvenience.

Thank you for that filter, it works really well for me here.

Subject: [Paraview] issue with python/qt wrapping on ubuntu: Cannot create
	GLX context. Aborting.
Message-ID: <CAOVFbFhTMfjOkfT=3A0A4ybyGZDo4=QCofnxqtQYEYrFUEtBjQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I've got an issue running a python/QT/VTK app built from the paraview-3.14
master branch and using qt-4.8 on ubuntu 11.04.  This has been working on
darwin as recently as a month ago and used to work on linux. The code
crashes with error:

ERROR: In
/home/cekees/proteus/externalPackages/ParaView/VTK/Rendering/vtkXOpenGLRenderWindow.cxx,
line 629
vtkXOpenGLRenderWindow (0x4ff4460): Cannot create GLX context.  Aborting.

When I insert the python debugger before the main bunch of Qt setup code
and single step through it, the code runs fine without error. If I let it
continue and/or remove the debugging statement entirely, it gives me the
crash. I've include the python code below. Any ideas on what is causing
this?

Thanks,
Chris

Message-ID: <CAPeaKqjgweuCTYSceTqJNeSyV+fL65hJS-xuo=deC+rbAAS2AQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hey,

I've been testing a render cluster with 4 nodes running 2x nVidia
Tesla C2050 cards. I run an x server on each of these machines, and
have pvserver rendering against each card. I've modified the basic
benchmark paraview comes with to actually stress them (the basic
benchmark tops out at 10M polys/sec at ~30% gpu usage). Everything
runs fine, except...

When I get about 30 max resolution Superquadrics on a scene rendering,
each machine, one by one, locks up hard with just an underscore on the
local terminals. I'm told by people who've done GPU programming before
that this is a GPU hang. That's odd, because Paraview should run
fine...but it's not.

How do I start debugging this?

Cagatay,

You're obviously affected by http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=11923

Xueli,

You may want to check whether any of the suggested solutions ("immediate
mode rendering") work that were made in an earlier thread dealing with
seemingly the same problem: http://markmail.org/message/czk47lrohdhcnr25

Dear David,


Thank you for your advice.
I tried to make .pvd file and succeeded to add time values
to my transient data.

Subject: [Paraview] plugin signature mismatch
Message-ID: <CAETCaPpBZKWr-cugLw4QpOPP9SMruAgC8Gi=neN8AL5rxY_XLQ@mail.gmail.com>

I compiled a plugin with MS Visual Studio 2008, using the 3.14 release
Paraview code. When I try to load the plugin in the distribution 3.14
(the one installed with the installer), I get this signature error:

"ERROR: In ..\..\..\..\src\ParaViewCore\ClientServerCore\vtkPVPluginLoader.cxx,
line 342
vtkPVPluginLoader (0A393048): Mismatch in versions:
ParaView Signature: paraviewplugin|MSVC|3.14
Plugin Signature: paraviewplugin||3.14"

I do not understand why the plugin signature does not have "MSVC" in
its string. I use the latest CMake executable.

Thanks for help,
Matei

This means that installed version of Paraview 3.14(from installer) was not
compiled with  MS Visual Studio 2008.
Will be good if you build Paraview 3.14 from source and use that..

Thank you, Jagjeet.

The message is confusing:

"ParaView Signature: paraviewplugin|MSVC|3.14
Plugin Signature: paraviewplugin||3.14""

This would tell me that ParaView is built with MSVC and the signature
of my plugin is missing the compiler information.

But thanks for clarifying this.

Yes, it works with my own built Paraview, but I would like to be able
to share this plugin with other people that use the same version but
installed with the official installer.

The ParaView 3.14 release was built with MS Visual Studio 2008 SP1.

Hy ! 

Hy I'm using ParaView 3.14  in a Cave environment using VRPN   when i
try to start ./pvserver --vrpn  .    It says cannot open file --vrpn)  (
which should mean the swtich --vrpn is not know) but on the Homepage of
ParaView is mentioned.   ANY IDEA ??

Hi,

I would like to watch a running transient simulation producing one binary vtu file per timestep. Is there a way to reload the current data set so that newly written timesteps are included (e.g. in the "Plot selection over time" filter), without closing and reopening the whole dataset?

Thank you,

Matthias

Hi,

I'm still trying to get texture on a sphere animated over time. My new approach is to start a trace and see what happens when I change the texture in the Display dialog (with the intention to generate a python script which does this automatically for all of my timesteps). Unfortunately, the texture is not specified in the trace...

try: paraview.simple
except: from paraview.simple import *
paraview.simple._DisableFirstRenderCameraReset()

TextureMaptoSphere3 = GetActiveSource()
DataRepresentation8 = GetDisplayProperties(TextureMaptoSphere3)
DataRepresentation8.Texture = []

Render()




Any ideas how I can specify a texture out of a jpeg in a python script?

Thanks for your help!
Sonja

I recently (just a few days ago), checked some code into the stage branch which adds support for "Command Buttons" which you can add using XML like this

    <CommandProperty
      name="Reload"
      label="Reload Data"
      command="Insert member function here">
    </CommandProperty>

and this is generated in the GUI panel for the filter as a button which triggers the command when the next Accept is clicked (or immediately if auto-accept is on). It just like all the Set/Get stuff with variables, but has no arguments, just a DoSomething trigger - just what you need.

If you tell me exactly which reader you are using, I will add this XML and test the reload feature you want.

If we're lucky, we can get it accepted in the next pv1.14 patch release

Hi John,

I am using the legacy vtk reader, at least I think so. Since I do not have to select a reader at file open, I don't know for 100% sure what ParaView does under the hood when opening my files. But they are in binary vtu format (vtk unstructured grid). I hope this is enough information. If not, how can I find out?

Thank you,

Matthias

Hi,

I have many tvu files, each one representing a timestep, and want to display the right time in Paraview instead of the timestep number. Looking for information, I have found a presentation "Working with time in Paraview" here: http://www.vgtc.org/PDF/slides/2008/visweek/tutorial6_biddiscombe_working.pdf. One possibility sems to be to create a file with extension pvd, containing a list of all vtu files with their associated time, like this:

<VTKFile type="Collection" version="0.1" byte_order="LittleEndian">
  <Collection>
    <DataSet timestep="0" group="" part="0" file="case_var0001.vtu"/>
    <DataSet timestep="10" group="" part="0" file="case_var0002.vtu"/>
    <DataSet timestep="20" group="" part="0" file="case_var0003.vtu"/>
    <DataSet timestep="30" group="" part="0" file="case_var0004.vtu"/>
    <DataSet timestep="40" group="" part="0" file="case_var0005.vtu"/>
    <DataSet timestep="50" group="" part="0" file="case_var0006.vtu"/>
    <DataSet timestep="60" group="" part="0" file="case_var0007.vtu"/>
    <DataSet timestep="70" group="" part="0" file="case_var0008.vtu"/>
    <DataSet timestep="80" group="" part="0" file="case_var0009.vtu"/>
    <DataSet timestep="90" group="" part="0" file="case_var0010.vtu"/>
    <DataSet timestep="100" group="" part="0" file="case_var0011.vtu"/>
    <DataSet timestep="110" group="" part="0" file="case_var0012.vtu"/>
    <DataSet timestep="120" group="" part="0" file="case_var0013.vtu"/>
    <DataSet timestep="130" group="" part="0" file="case_var0014.vtu"/>
    <DataSet timestep="140" group="" part="0" file="case_var0015.vtu"/>
    <DataSet timestep="150" group="" part="0" file="case_var0015.vtu"/>
  </Collection>
</VTKFile>

I have tried that, but it apparently does not work like that. I get the error message attached below (ParaVoew 3.14.0, WIN XP).
What have I done wrong?

Thank you for a hint,

Matthias

Hi Sonja,

If you save the state as a python file, you will be able to see the
objects created and their settings. That could help you for that one.

Hi Sonja,
I struggled to get a texture applied through python for quite a while and I finally got it working with a plane source in 3.12. I never tried it with a TextureMapToSphere object but I don't see why it wouldn't work the same way. This is how I did it, I hope it's helpful. 
 
from paraview import servermanager
Plane1 = Plane()
Plane1.Origin = Org
Plane1.Point1 = PlaneX
Plane1.Point2 = PlaneY
Plane1.UpdatePipeline()
Render()
SetActiveSource(Plane1)
PlaneRep= GetDisplayProperties(Plane1)
PlaneRep.Representation = 'Surface'
texProxy = servermanager.CreateProxy("textures","ImageTexture")
texProxy .GetProperty("FileName").SetElement(0, pathToTextureImage)
texProxy .UpdateVTKObjects()
PlaneRep.Texture=texProxy 
Plane1.UpdateVTKObjects()
Render()

Hi Christian,

Here is the latest documentation for Paraview in CAVE

http://www.itk.org/Wiki/ParaView/Users_Guide/CAVE_Display

The --vrpn option was replaced with a different mechanism (see document).
Can you send me a reference to the page where you found the info so that
can be updated.

Means that 22 characters in on the 4'th line of your xml file, or in other
words the 178'th character from the start there is a syntax error.
Looking there I see ?10" and noticed that the open and close quote marks
are different.

What happens if you replace all of the ?'s with "'s.

It's likely that turning on VTK_USE_BOOST brings in code (like the Enzo and
Flash readers) that need features from hdf5 that we don't compile.

This is likely a bug. Can you help us resolve it by:

1) Were there any hdf5 related compilation errors or warnings for you?
2) What is your setting of VTK_USE_SYSTEM_HDF5?
3) Try recompiling with VTK_USE_BOOST off.
4) Try turning VTK_USE_SYSTEM_HDF5 on and point it to a recent HDF5.

5) File a bug report.

Can you give us more details so that we can investigate?
Which OS, what file type, and what the error message was for starters.

Subject: [Paraview] New to .vtk files and paraview
Message-ID: <CAOe5_9xo-0yF1rY-JWhPHNoQ3oVFj_DgpzggAvzZv85sK_HOaw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all, i am a graduate student in mathematicst and im doing a thesis to
solve PDE for u:R^3--->R (the total space is 4-D).

Later my programs i want to plot my solution.... i have a uniform grid on
[0,1]^3 and the approximated value of u on (x_i,y_j,z_k).

I have 2 way to plot a 4-D functions:
1) curve of level u(x,y,z)=cost(t)... with t ? R
2) u(x0,y,z) or u(x,y0,z) or u(x,y,z0) with different x0, y0, z0.

However... i want try to use Paraview, that i read need .vtk files.
Can i have a .vtk file plotting a function u:R^2--->R, to see the structure
of that file?
(i read something... but the file explain better)

Someone have suggestions to do the plotting 4-d?

Hi,  

1. libvtkhdf5.dylib compiles without errors nor warnings.

2. VTK_USE_SYSTEM_HDF5 is Off in my config.

3. Same result: linking error of libvtkPVVTKExtensions.dylib

4. I already had HDF5 installed via Macports (version 1.8.8). Turning
VTK_USE_SYSTEM_HDF5 On with the Macports HDF5 library
configures ok (cmake finds the include dirs and the libs) but it fails
to compile with the following error:

Subject: [Paraview] command for block movement along the fault plane
Message-ID: <loom.20120309T002634-780@post.gmane.org>

Suppose the diagonal is a fault plane in square. Now how do I make movement the 
half block up or down along the fault plane in paraview? I have already 
dislocation.vtk file, which I can open in paraview.

Hello Matei,

Using the new version of CMake should fix your problem. See discussion
here: http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2012-January/023713.html
Delete cache before generating with the new CMake.

Thank you Nikhil ! 

Sorry this --vrpn thing was not in your homepage it comes on  


http://wiki.iq-station.com/index.php?title=ImmersiveParaView 

I shouldnt trust eh even it has a WIKI in its name. 

In the new vrpn thing there are some new issues i dont know: 

this is part of a .pvsm file which should be loaded before usage:

Hi Christian, 



Here is the latest documentation for Paraview in CAVE

http://www.itk.org/Wiki/ParaView/Users_Guide/CAVE_Display 



The --vrpn option was replaced with a different mechanism (see
document). Can you send me a reference to the page where you found the
info so that can be updated.

Hy I'm using ParaView 3.14 in a Cave environment using VRPN when i try

Means that 22 characters in on the 4'th line of your xml file, or in other words the 178'th character from the start there is a syntax error.
Looking there I see "10" and noticed that the open and close quote marks are different.

What happens if you replace all of the "'s with "'s.

Subject: [Paraview] Visualization of principle stresses
Message-ID: <CAMJ+d+58OHr34YTRj4W-jh9P0J+FNOy0ZMaE1-e+BLhpPVGL3w@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

i want to visualize the directions of principle stresses computed by a
finite element solver in paraview. I got the directions of these stresses
as vectors. I used the legacy vtk file format. I choosed the unstructured
grid dataset with triangle elements for the grid(as they are in the FE
solver). For the vectors i choosed CELL_DATA and every cell got an vector.
I used the glyph filter to visualize these vectors ( CELL CENTERS-> GLYPH),
but is there an other possibility to do that? Not as arrows or so, but to
get a result like streamtracers? Interpolated lines? Streamtracers doesnt
work here, because i think they have a direction and the principle stresses
have no direction. I tried the Surface LIC representation, but i got no
other result as with the surface representation.
To cut a long story short: I have vectors as CELL_DATA and a unstructured
grid and i want to visualize them as closed lines over the grid. And not
with the glyph filter, that works but I would prefer this other
representation.
I'm new in paraview so i hope you can help me with this topic and I'm
looking forward for your answers.

Greetings,
Eric

Matthias,

Using the topic_CommandProperty branch on the stage git repo

I added the following to readers.xml under the
   <SourceProxy name="XMLUnstructuredGridReaderCore"
     ...
     <CommandProperty
       name="Reload"
       label="Reload Data"
       command="Modified"
       si_class="vtkSIProperty">
     </CommandProperty>

and a button is created inside the panel for the reader (the file series reader also needs to expose the property because the reader is actually inside the file series reader).
When you click the button the client side proxy is marked as modified, and when you hit accept the Modified function is called on the server side object (the reader) - this then triggers a re-execution and the reader rereads from disk.

All works as expected. I shall see if I can get this accepted into the next patch release as I believe it is a very handy capability to have in a number of places. I'll add the xml changes and push them too, but perhaps other readers (of the list) might suggest which other readers (of files) need this feature added.

JB

Subject: [Paraview] reload data

Hi,

I would like to watch a running transient simulation producing one binary vtu file per timestep. Is there a way to reload the current data set so that newly written timesteps are included (e.g. in the "Plot selection over time" filter), without closing and reopening the whole dataset?

Thank you,

Matthias

typically the interactor styles help you choose what  type of interaction
you want to do. If you want head tracking use the vtkVRStyleTracking which
uses tracking data 'cspad.head' and changes the property
RenderView1.HeadPose (in the state file)

If your scene has a  slice and you want to manipulate the slice then you
can use  vtkVRStyleGrabNTranslateSliceOrigin style. It basically takes
tracker inputs and a button to change the slice origin
(CutFunction.Origin). So you can press button and move the wand to move the
slice plane.

I will be updating the document with more info about the interactor styles.

John,

(I haven't read the full thread so I may be missing something here, so
bear with me)

I am wondering what's the difference between a vtkSMCommandProperty
and vtkSMProperty? ParaView ServerManager does support using
vtkSMProperty directly for the purpose you mentioned. Maybe all we
need to add is suppose for create the "push button" when such a
property is found in the XML, isn't it?

Well functionally speaking it has a couple of differences.



a) when you create a panel, a button is made, non checkable (stateless effectively) -  (code changes to)

Qt/Components/pqNamedWidgets.cxx



b) when the button is clicked,

Qt/Core/pqPropertyLinks.cxx

Qt/Core/pqSMAdaptor.cxx

Qt/Core/pqSMAdaptor.h

Have been tweaked to actually trigger a modified on the proxy, and when the push to the server is made, the vtkObject has a modified triggered. I don't think the SMProperty on its own would do that. No doubt you would know how to manage it, but I found that having a CommandProperty allowed me to encapsulate what I wanted without affecting anything else.

In the new vrpn thing there are some new issues i dont know:

the thing is i dont know what i should fill in for

RenderView1.HeadPose 
or 
<Style class="vtkVRStyleGrabNTranslateSliceOrigin"
origin="CutFunction.Origin"> 
CutFunktion.Origin 


 

I understand your concern. The wiki page does document this very well.
But typically the interactor styles help you choose what type of
interaction you want to do. If you want head tracking use the
vtkVRStyleTracking which uses tracking data 'cspad.head' and changes the
property RenderView1.HeadPose (in the state file) 



If your scene has a slice and you want to manipulate the slice then you
can use vtkVRStyleGrabNTranslateSliceOrigin style. It basically takes
tracker inputs and a button to change the slice origin
(CutFunction.Origin). So you can press button and move the wand to move
the slice plane. 



I will be updating the document with more info about the interactor
styles.

Hi Christian, 



Here is the latest documentation for Paraview in CAVE

http://www.itk.org/Wiki/ParaView/Users_Guide/CAVE_Display 



The --vrpn option was replaced with a different mechanism (see
document). Can you send me a reference to the page where you found the
info so that can be updated.

Hi Christian,

Yes this will be a little annoying till a GUI is developed to handle this.
But right now we have need to manually figure this out.

You need to construct your pipeline and have pv Proxy Objects in place
before you can apply VR interactor styles to them.

So things like 'RenderView1.HeadPose' implies 'Proxy.Property'. The state
file stores this information about what Proxies and properties are
available so you could infer this info from the state file. An easier way
to figure out the objects available is to use the Property Linking Tool in
the GUI

Tools->Manage Links->Add->Mode:PropertyLinks

I am attaching a sample state file which may be useful.

Message-ID: <4F5E2091.4070903@knmi.nl>

Dear Paraview users,

I have problem with data that origin of grads. We have a program to 
convert grads data into NetCDF format. But this data can not be shown in 
Paraview. I don't have any problem to show normal nc data.

Have you ever experience the same problem?

Thanks!

I don't know what you mean by a "grad" or what problem it is causing, so
I'm going to make a total guess.  I am guessing that you mean gradian (a
unit equal to 9/10 of a degree).  Furthermore, because I can't think of
any other way such units would mess you up, I am guessing that you are
trying to write spherical coordinates in terms of gradians, but ParaView
is interpreting them either as degrees or as Cartesian coordinates.


Assuming that this is the problem, it is caused by the fact that the
default netCDF reader for ParaView honors the CF convention
(http://cf-pcmdi.llnl.gov), and the CF convention specifies spherical
coordinates in terms of degrees.  To specify angles in any other units is
to break the convention.

Your best solution is to convert your gradians to degrees (it's OK to have
floating-point degrees) and write a netCDF file that properly follows the
CF convention.

If I have completely missed the point of your question, you'll have to
better explain what are grads and what problem you are having with them.

Since your data consists of locally 2D elements (triangles, not gets)
you might have better luck with both LIC and streamlines if you first
apply the "Surface Vectors" filter. This constrains the vector
data such that it is always tangential to the local surface.

Also, another option for vector visualization you might try is the
Warp be Vector filter, which bends the geometry according to the local
vector field.

Message-ID: <CAOVFbFg848+_oiLvrufpAA+B=T-9hLq+Ype3OEaAPL97U8aPHw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

My simple pyqt gui using vtk is crashing with a seg fault during
parallel runs since updating to 3.14 (master from git repo). The
system is Ubuntu 11.10 (GNU/Linux 3.0.0-11-generic x86_64). I noticed
that right before it crashes it prints "ComputeVisiblePropBounds" and
found that a simple print statement has (presumably) been left in the
code (see below). 1) Have there been changes to the parallel API that
you would expect would break code which was working under 3.12 and 2)
Should I check out something besides master for now and if so which
tag or branch?

Thanks,
Chris

void vtkParallelRenderManager::ComputeVisiblePropBounds(vtkRenderer *ren,
                                                        double bounds[6])
{
  cout << "ComputeVisiblePropBounds" << endl;

Thanks for your reply.

Grads is a software package that widely used by meteorological societies
  worldwide. http://www.iges.org/grads/.
The nc file I get can  be shown by ferret (which is also a software package
used by earth science communities) and Grads (Grads can read binary and
data).

The problem may occurred by conversion...

Subject: [Paraview] Unexpected lines in "Surface with Edges" mode with PV
 3.14
Message-ID: <4F5F1D3C.2040004@onera.fr>

Hello, all.

I have found a strange behavior of PV 3.14 in "Surface with Edges" mode 
for some surfaces: when reading some Tecplot files that contained a 
structured mesh, I get some unexpected lines that don't exist in the 
file and that don't appear when I select the "Wireframe" mode. The 
"Wireframe" view is correct, the "Surface with Edges" view is not.

PV 3.12 does not show such unexpected lines: both "Surface with Edges" 
and "Wireframe" views are correct and show the same exact structured mesh.

I attach to this mail two screen shots of the same surface viewed in 
"Surface with Edges" mode: the file wakepv312.png is obtained with PV 
3.12 and the file wakepv314.png is obtained with PV 3.14.

I must say that this problem comes only with some surfaces that have 
more or less "strange" curvature like my test file that contains the 
surface representation of the wake behind a wing. If you cannot 
reproduce this problem, I will send you my tecplot file.

Best regards.

Hello.

In addition to my previous mail, I discovered that this problem of 
unexpected lines in "Surface with Edges" mode with PV 3.14 concerns only 
the Linux version ! I am using the 64 bits version on Linux CentOS 5.7.

The "Surface with Edges" view is correct with PV 3.14 Windows 32 bits on 
Vista Home Premium SP2 !

If it may help you, the problem on the Linux version does not come from 
the Tecplot file format: I have also problems with surfaces given in VTM 
format.

I add the gzip of my Tecplot test file that contains the surface 
representation of a wake behind a wing.

Best regards.

Richard.

** Reply Requested When Convenient **


Hy Nikhil ! 

Yes it worked at least for the head sensor, for the wandpos i need the
cutfunktion  i didnt managed to put this in the pvsm file (if i did it
crashes sometimes or even didnt start at all)  
it seems to me that using the VRPlugin the system is slower than
before, is there something i can do to make it a little bit faster ( i
have enough cpus) it looks to me that even the crosshair cursor is
slower than before, so this looks like it done allways slow using this
VRPlugin . 
But anyway thanks for your help on this issue before i managed with you
help to make it run.

Hi Christian, 



Yes this will be a little annoying till a GUI is developed to handle
this. But right now we have need to manually figure this out. 



You need to construct your pipeline and have pv Proxy Objects in place
before you can apply VR interactor styles to them. 



So things like 'RenderView1.HeadPose' implies 'Proxy.Property'. The
state file stores this information about what Proxies and properties are
available so you could infer this info from the state file. An easier
way to figure out the objects available is to use the Property Linking
Tool in the GUI 



Tools->Manage Links->Add->Mode:PropertyLinks



I am attaching a sample state file which may be useful.

the thing is i dont know what i should fill in for

RenderView1.HeadPose 
or 
<Style class="vtkVRStyleGrabNTranslateSliceOrigin"
origin="CutFunction.Origin"> 
CutFunktion.Origin 


 

I understand your concern. The wiki page does document this very well.
But typically the interactor styles help you choose what type of
interaction you want to do. If you want head tracking use the
vtkVRStyleTracking which uses tracking data 'cspad.head' and changes the
property RenderView1.HeadPose (in the state file) 



If your scene has a slice and you want to manipulate the slice then you
can use vtkVRStyleGrabNTranslateSliceOrigin style. It basically takes
tracker inputs and a button to change the slice origin
(CutFunction.Origin). So you can press button and move the wand to move
the slice plane. 



I will be updating the document with more info about the interactor
styles.

Hi Christian, 




Here is the latest documentation for Paraview in CAVE

http://www.itk.org/Wiki/ParaView/Users_Guide/CAVE_Display 



The --vrpn option was replaced with a different mechanism (see
document). Can you send me a reference to the page where you found the
info so that can be updated.

Hy I'm using ParaView 3.14 in a Cave environment using VRPN when i try

ParaView is mentioned. ANY IDEA ??

The cutfunction typically comes with a slice or clip filter. Can you send
me a few more details as to the process you followed and what errors you
see.

HeadPos and WandPos are both set on the vtkCamera (or RenderView in case of
PV). There was a bug which didnt update the WandPos on the server side and
I pushed a fix for that and in VTK and am waiting for it to get into
ParaView master (it may come in by Friday).

Yes we identified this performance issue as well last week and have a fix
for it in next branch and am awaiting for it to get into ParaView master
(hopefully by Friday). You can pull pv next and compile it in the time
being.

Subject: [Paraview] [EXTERNAL]  Paraview can't show grads origin data

Message-ID: <CB84C725.8A6F%kmorel@sandia.gov>

OK.  I see now.  Clearly I'm not familiar with the GrADS software or its
data formats.  If someone else on the ParaView mailing list is familiar
with GrADS it would be great if they speak up, but according to the mail
archives GrADS has not yet been discussed.


I suspect the problem is that ParaView simply does not know how to read
the type of netCDF files written by GrADS.  NetCDF is not a completely
specified file format.  Rather, it is a collection of arrays that are
"self describing."  That is, the arrays and dimensions are named and can
have properties, but to read them properly you really have to understand
what these metadata mean.

There are actually several readers in ParaView that use netCDF as the
underlying technology, but only one that makes an attempt to generally
read unknown "conventions."  It will assume that arrays are regular grids
with up to three physical dimensions (x/y/z or lat/lon/z) and optionally a
time dimension.  Based on about 5 minutes looking at the GrADS web pages,
I'm guessing that the netCDF file GrADS is outputting contains 5
dimensional arrays.  In this case, the ParaView reader won't know what to
do with 5 dimensions and will therefore issue an error if you try to read
one.  (You never actually said what went wrong, but perhaps that is it.)

I'm sorry that probably none of this is helping.  Ultimately, it sounds
like a new reader would have to be created for ParaView.

Dear Paraview users and developers,

I would like to use the *vtkReconstructionFilter* inside of the python
shell in order to generate a surface from a vtkPointsSet.
But I do not find this class.

Is it not available within the vtk version embeeded with the paraview 3.14
binary release ?

Thanks,

A.Marsan

If you mean the vtkSurfaceReconstructionFilter, you have to import the
imaging module:

from paraview.vtk.imaging import vtkSurfaceReconstructionFilter

I see that if you make a second selection in the same 2d plot, the old points are unselected and the new points are selected.  But if you try to select nothing, nothing changes.  I would think that the current selection would be cleared out, so this sounds like a bug.

I also notice that if I go to a different view and select a different object, the old selection in the 2d plot remains.  I believe all the selections are supposed to be linked together, so this sounds like a different bug.

We have been working on iterative selections, it looks like we were
concentrating so hard on iteratively building them up / removing parts
of selections that the behavior of unselecting when in an empty space
has stopped working as expected.

It shouldn't be too difficult to fix this, I will look into it.

Hi,

The stuff (paraview.app etc.)  in my build tree works but 'make
install' fails in part because it's trying to install the vtk python
module in

$PREFIX/bin/Python

which is a link to
$PREFIX/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/python
(mac OS is partially blind to case)

If I manually change the install location to something else like
$PREFIX/paraview-vtk-stuff, then things get further but verify_app
still fails. Does this look familiar to anybody?

Hello

I can't change the color of the cube axes. The version is 3.14 on a linux 32bit os, which is downloaded from the official site. I do not have this problem for 3.12.

Dear Nikihil ! 

YEESS very good  thank you for your support i tell you next ParaView
master how it s going on 

the secound thing with the cutfunvtion: 

I try to visualsize a skill made from a mr in the cave. 
With a PAD ( incuding a tracking device and some buittons ) a try to
move the skul and a secound button where i try to make a kind of hole in
the skull and i can see thru. 
therefor i need a Headtracker ok  
a wand ( not ok) 
a button ( should be ok) 
and a secound button which simulates the tracking coordinate and a hole
or cut there. 

  

thank again

Hy Nikhil ! 


Yes it worked at least for the head sensor, for the wandpos i need the
cutfunktion i didnt managed to put this in the pvsm file (if i did it
crashes sometimes or even didnt start at all) 
 



The cutfunction typically comes with a slice or clip filter. Can you
send me a few more details as to the process you followed and what
errors you see. 



HeadPos and WandPos are both set on the vtkCamera (or RenderView in
case of PV). There was a bug which didnt update the WandPos on the
server side and I pushed a fix for that and in VTK and am waiting for it
to get into ParaView master (it may come in by Friday). 





it seems to me that using the VRPlugin the system is slower than
before, is there something i can do to make it a little bit faster ( i
have enough cpus) it looks to me that even the crosshair cursor is
slower than before, so this looks like it done allways slow using this
VRPlugin . 
But anyway thanks for your help on this issue before i managed with you
help to make it run. 

 



Yes we identified this performance issue as well last week and have a
fix for it in next branch and am awaiting for it to get into ParaView
master (hopefully by Friday). You can pull pv next and compile it in the
time being.

Hi Christian, 



Yes this will be a little annoying till a GUI is developed to handle
this. But right now we have need to manually figure this out. 



You need to construct your pipeline and have pv Proxy Objects in place
before you can apply VR interactor styles to them. 



So things like 'RenderView1.HeadPose' implies 'Proxy.Property'. The
state file stores this information about what Proxies and properties are
available so you could infer this info from the state file. An easier
way to figure out the objects available is to use the Property Linking
Tool in the GUI 



Tools->Manage Links->Add->Mode:PropertyLinks



I am attaching a sample state file which may be useful.

http://wiki.iq-station.com/index.php?title=ImmersiveParaView 


I shouldnt trust eh even it has a WIKI in its name. 


In the new vrpn thing there are some new issues i dont know: 


this is part of a .pvsm file which should be loaded before usage:

the thing is i dont know what i should fill in for 


<Style class="vtkVRStyleTracking" set_property="RenderView1.HeadPose">



RenderView1.HeadPose 
or 
<Style class="vtkVRStyleGrabNTranslateSliceOrigin"
origin="CutFunction.Origin"> 
CutFunktion.Origin 


 

I understand your concern. The wiki page does document this very well.
But typically the interactor styles help you choose what type of
interaction you want to do. If you want head tracking use the
vtkVRStyleTracking which uses tracking data 'cspad.head' and changes the
property RenderView1.HeadPose (in the state file) 



If your scene has a slice and you want to manipulate the slice then you
can use vtkVRStyleGrabNTranslateSliceOrigin style. It basically takes
tracker inputs and a button to change the slice origin
(CutFunction.Origin). So you can press button and move the wand to move
the slice plane. 



I will be updating the document with more info about the interactor
styles. 





thank you for your help

Hi Christian, 




Here is the latest documentation for Paraview in CAVE

http://www.itk.org/Wiki/ParaView/Users_Guide/CAVE_Display 



The --vrpn option was replaced with a different mechanism (see
document). Can you send me a reference to the page where you found the
info so that can be updated.

Hi,

We are looking at buying a 3D monitor to take advantage of the Paraview --stereo options. Does anyone have any experience with this? We'd be very grateful to hear from anyone who's set up this kind of thing before.

Thanks in advance,
Owen.

I've used a Zalmon 3D screen where alternate lines are left/right. The main drawback being half the resolution in 3D mode and GUI looks awful. Passive glasses are a plus. (same as the cheap ones you get at the cinema). The pixel scan lines are polarized on the screen.

Also an Acer 3D monitor which uses left right alternate frames (need high refresh rate). Much better, but make sure you have the sync stuff to trigger the eye glasses to switch left/right. I prefer the active ones for quality, but if you don't use it often the interlaced is not so bad.

After some work i achieved to get my data to the Points, so I got
POINT_DATA now. And Surface LIC does it work now. So my first problems are
solved. But one still remains. The vectors have directions, of course. Out
of the algorithm  I used to create them there is no chance that all vectors
point into the same direction and physically that isnt needed. (principal
stresses) Because of that Surface LIC got me vortexes into the lines where
they shouldnt be. Is there any possibility to say paraview that the
direction of the vector field should be ignored?

If no does somebody know a visualization tool that supports that? Maybe
with a file format as simple as legacy vtk?

Thanks for your help.

An image (of enough resolution to see the glyphs and LIC texture)
would help clarify what you mean.

But, if you don't care about the direction of the vector field, take
its magnitude and use scalar visualization techniques on that. One way
to do that is to use the expression mag(vectorarrayname) in the
calculator filter.

Owen,

We have two Windows 7-based systems and a linux-based system running
ParaView in stereo. Someone in our lab posted detailed instructions
for getting a Windows 7-based system set up for stereo can be found
here:

http://cismm.cs.unc.edu/core-projects/visualization-and-analysis/setting-up-a-simple-stereo-system/

The instructions are for getting another program to run in stereo, but
they apply equally as well to ParaView (we have used ParaView in
stereo mode).

Hope that helps,
Cory

Hi,

The "--use-offscreen-rendering" option doesn't seem to exist in pvpython
anymore?  Is this deliberate?

Thanks,
Paul

Subject: [Paraview] List of several probe location
Message-ID: <1331735297.79524.YahooMailNeo@web113212.mail.gq1.yahoo.com>

Hello,
I'm new with ParaView, and I would like to get a list with interactively chosen points.
For this:
1. read the case
2. extract block
3. probelocation
4. spread sheet
5. activate "apply changes automatically"

Now, I can pick a point with the mouse+key "p" and see the coordinates in the spread sheet.
The problem is that I would like to pick a whole bunch of points (29) and also save the spread sheet list.
How can I do this?
I use ParaView 3.12.0 64-bit on Windows.

Thanks!

/Dragos

Great, thanks. I've pushed the fix (http://paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=12997)

It'll be included in 3.14.1.

Subject: [Paraview] Ply visualization
Message-ID: <DUB105-W55C70515F1D19281E881DBDD590@phx.gbl>


Dear all,
I'd like visualize fields associated to my mesh nodes, stored in a .PLY file. Each field is a float property of vertices, but, as far as I can see, ParaView doesn't see them.
For example, in this ply I added a fourth 'temperature' field, but I can't find it in the User Interface. Is there a way to see this field (and additional ones) without dropping the ply format?
Thank you,
Fabrizio

Hi Owen,

I have seen Mitsubishi WD-73838 73" 1080p to work with ParaView's VR setup.
I think it uses checkerboard stereo.

Please can you also apply the patch here?:

	http://paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=12991

This also stops me compiling using nmake without manual intervention.

Thanks,
Paul

Great, thanks. I've pushed the fix (http://paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=12997)

It'll be included in 3.14.1.

   - head tracking is not a problem
   - A button where you can move the world with the tracked pad . This is
   available as the update matrix interactor style which updates wandpos. Wand
   is simply a name we use for any tracked device other than head. Basically
   you want to manipulate the world based on some tracked input and updating
   wand pos does that.
   - For making a hole in the skull part you can put a cutting plane  and
   use the existing interactor styles to manipulate its cut function. However
   the cut plane may have to be turned on and off from Paraview's GUI cause we
   do not have any interactor style yet to handle this.

Note: The entire scene has to be constructed in Paraview with the data the
filters and the cutting plane before the interactor styles are placed
inside the state file.

Message-ID: <3d6ee4a013a73106dc7c0c2422b6490c.squirrel@webmail.pitt.edu>

Hi,

I didn't see a paraview plugin for the  vtkImageGaussianSmooth.cxx filter
in the paraview Filters menus or the filters.xml file.
Is there some equivalent ?

If not:  am I right that I will need to write a little paraview plugin
wrapper in
order to be able to use vtkImageGaussianSmooth in a pvpython script ?
Any reason other than somewhat ugly parameter specification or lack
of interest/time that there isn't a plugin ?

thanks
kate

I'm solving a problem that can be simplified into a bidimensional problem.
The problem is the estimation of the wear line of a blast furnace hearth.
I want to "rotate" my bidimensional solution around the axis to generate a
3d figure. The figures will help you guys to understand.

The following figure shows the temperature map of a radial section of the
hearth.


[image: Inline image 1]


The next figure shows an idea of what I want to do:

[image: Inline image 1]

This figure was generated with the rotation filter. I used the filter 4
times and have changed the orientation of each one, just to show the idea
of the final result that I want. The 3d figure should be something like a
cylinder. It's like an interpolation of the rotation of the bidimensional
figure around the center axis.

Anyone knows how can I do that?

Does the Rotational Extrusion filter do what you want?  (You'll have to convert your data to polydata if necessary first.  You'll also have to transform the data as the rotational extrusion only rotates around the Z axis.)

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [Paraview] Rotate 2d plane into 3d

I'm solving a problem that can be simplified into a bidimensional problem. The problem is the estimation of the wear line of a blast furnace hearth.
I want to "rotate" my bidimensional solution around the axis to generate a 3d figure. The figures will help you guys to understand.

The following figure shows the temperature map of a radial section of the hearth.


[Inline image 1]


The next figure shows an idea of what I want to do:

[Inline image 1]

This figure was generated with the rotation filter. I used the filter 4 times and have changed the orientation of each one, just to show the idea
of the final result that I want. The 3d figure should be something like a cylinder. It's like an interpolation of the rotation of the bidimensional
figure around the center axis.

Anyone knows how can I do that?

Kate,

ParaView doesn't include most of the imaging filters by default due to
2 reasons,
1. not commonly used by users
2. may not necessary work in parallel (esp. for filters that change extents)

You are correct, you'd need to write a little plugin to use it in
pvpython or the GUI. You can simply write an XML plugin. It should be
fairly simple for vtkImageGaussianSmooth, it doesn't seem to have any
complex properties.

Hi Kate,

It shouldn't be too hard for you to expose the vtkImageGaussianSmooth in 
PV.  I have one caveat for you re: using vtkImageGaussianSmooth in 
parallel: when it runs it will trigger a complete re-execution of your 
entire pipeline including the reader.This happens because 
vtkImageGaussianSmooth increases the update extents which, unless 
something has changed in the recent version of PV, would be satisfied by 
the reader re-executing. this could cause you some performance related 
issues especially for large data where I/O becomes a significant 
bottleneck. On the other hand, this re-execution would happen only when 
running in parallel and if you have small data it might not be too bad.

I encountered this issue a while back. with our data size the additional 
I/O was unacceptable. i wrote a parallel ghost cell generator for image 
data to prevent the pipeline re-execution for operations like kernel 
convolution that require ghost cells. The plugin includes a kernel 
convolution filter as well. To use it you'd have to build and load our 
plugin and add the "image ghosts" filter right before the "kernel 
convolution" filter. Our kernel convolution filter also has a CUDA 
implementation that's about 20x faster than the cpu version (note: CUDA 
stuff is still being developed, still some issue when update extent is 
too large to fit on the gpu). I'm attaching a link to the latest release 
of the plugin in case you could use it. It requires a parallel build of 
PV. http://www.hpcvis.com/SciVisToolKit/SciVisToolKit-12.02.tar.gz

I just saw Burlen's response and yes, I missed the fact that
vtkImageGaussianSmooth changes extents in which case things do get
complicated, as Burlen suggests.

Hi Burlen,  Utkarsh,

Thanks much for your detailed answers, and the caveat.
A developer here just told me that vtkImageGaussianSmooth
might not be what I need.  I am trying to achive a non-pixellated
look in a rendering of a slice from a volume.

Right now I read in the volume and choose a slice representation to
look at a selected plane.  The datatype remains uniform grid.
As per the image intensities in the voume, it looks a bit pixellated.
Changing shading between flat/Gouraud makes no difference, I think
because its not a surface.

If I read in the volume and then use the slice filter to extract a slice.
The output slice is polygonal mesh datatype.
I choose a surface representation to look at that slice and there is
a nice smoother look across the pixels.  (Changing shading between
flat/Gouraud
doesn't seem to make a  difference here either.)

The developer here thinks that even if I pre-smooth my volume with
vtkImageGaussianSmooth the uniform grid slice representation will
look a little pixellated.  Is there a way to get the nice smoothness of
the polygonal mesh surface look on my uniform grid slice representation ?
My script will just be a little more complicated if I need to call the
slice filter,
so I'd rather not if this can be handled at the representation level.

thanks
kate

Hi Kate,

Does changing from Slice representation to Surface representation make a 
difference? does your dataset have cell or point data?

i guess it has to do with the way slice representation works? I'm sure 
Utkarsh knows, and may know a way to make it do what you want.

I hadn't noticed this as our data has such a high resolution that the 
differences between slice and surface representations aren't showing up. 
but zooming in I can see what you mean.

Does the niftivolume reader let you subset the data? you could 
effectively select a slice that way, which has the added benefit of 
reducing your I/O, and use the surface representation to get the look 
you desire.

We have been working on iterative selections, it looks like we were concentrating so hard on iteratively building them up / removing parts of selections that the behavior of unselecting when in an empty space has stopped working as expected.

It shouldn't be too difficult to fix this, I will look into it.

I didn't see an email - did you assign it to me? I will keep an eye
out, and thanks for reporting the issue - I hadn't spotted this. I
will see if I can come up with a decent test case too.

Message-ID: <AE32B4F6-5A85-4947-8A12-13CC312F50D4@llnl.gov>

Hello, wizards and keepers of deep Paraview wisdom:

For some reason, on our RHEL 6 clusters, during a normal build, I see this: 
-- Looking for shl_load in dld;dl
-- Looking for shl_load in dld;dl - not found

However, trying to package our paraview install process in a dpkg, I see this during the cmake process: 
-- Looking for shl_load in dld;dl
-- Looking for shl_load in dld;dl - found

Because of that, later in the log, the following happens about 3% into the build:
 
cd /tmp/dpkg-mkdeb.HqY7g9wWL0/src/ParaView-3.14.0-Build/VTK/Utilities/vtklibxml2 && /usr/local/tools/cmake-2.8.7/bin/cmake -E cmake_link_script CMakeFiles/vtklibxml2.dir/link.txt --verbose=1

collect2: ld returned 1 exit status

Curiously, it does not stop there but waits until 26% of the way through before erroring out. 
And it all comes back to this line in the ParaView-3.14.0-Source/VTK/Utilities/vtklibxml2/CMakeLists.txt file: 

CHECK_LIBRARY_EXISTS_CONCAT("dld"      shl_load       HAVE_SHLLOAD)

I have commented out that line and hope to come back in the morning learning that I succeeded.  So far, so good, the offending library compiled this time.  :-)  What I'm wondering is, how can I figure out what's different in my mkdeb world, and how can I make the build successful without hacking into low level source files like this?  

Thanks!

This crash is apparently due to my attempt at off screen rendering.
Not sure if it's and os mesa problem on ubuntu or just a problem with
the way I was trying to do off screen rendering.

Dear Kenneth,

Thanks a lot for you effort to reply my mail.

The problem is solve now. It was simpler than it looks. It only because
the data produced in this way is 4-D (x,y,z,t). When I convert it into 
3-D(x,y,t)
everything is fine.

But I have some other problems: the Paraview *crashes* when I'm making 
movie
or just make many png files series. I was forced to cut the time steps 
into many
small pieces in order to keep Paraview running. It makes no difference 
whether
use 1fps or 2**n fps.

A few months ago I could make avi formatted movie without any problem. And
in the time nothing has  changed with my computer. By the way I'm using 
version 3.10.

Cheers!
Xueli

Message-ID: <CAOPoeZOk4k1HPMwsymzkjA2aqs4cFkL6ayyek0Ue20QfmUN5kg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,
I am trying to plot some molecular quantities using Paraview. I have two
cube files one containing the density and one containing the electrostatic
potential.
What I would like to do is to plot an isodensity surface (this I was able
to do) and then color map the values of the electrostatic potential on this
surface.
Is there a way to do this?
By the way, I was able to plot also the atomic centers using the Glyph
filter, is there a way to also display the bonds?
Thank you.

Subject: [Paraview] Visibility in Comparative View Inspector
Message-ID: <4F61B898.5020100@grs-sim.de>

Hi all,

I am using a Comparative View to visualize data at different time points 
side by side.
Say I have some annotation as a text object (created from 
Sources->Text), which I want to show up only in one view of the 
Comparative View array.
How can this be done?

What I did is the following:
In the Comparative View Inspector, chose "Text1" from the first 
drop-down menu right to the "+"-button. Then chose "Visibility" from the 
second menu, and added this to the parameter list by clicking the "+" 
button.
In the parameter list I then get a new entry named 
"Text1:<unrecognized-property>", which already seems strange to me. And 
finally the values for the different views are all 0, and if I change 
any of them nothing happens. I still see the text in all of the views.

Did I do it the right way?
Any help appreciated!

Cheers
Andreas

Message-ID: <CAK6Z60cjzMx+juFksXBuAt7S4L6m2qCiJ-F9+wfSctC8acmceQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

the ParaView GUI has this nifty little button action "Zoom To Data"
which displays the current object such that it somehow fits its
window.

Is there a similar thing for the Python paraview.simple module? I'm
trying to get a hang on it with certain view options such as

 view = pv.GetRenderView()
 view.CameraFocalPoint = [0, 0, 0]
 view.CameraViewAngle = 90
 view.CameraPosition = [0, 0, 10]
 view.ViewSize = [600, 600]

but what I would really like to have is to set the camera at a
distance such that the object(s) just fit into the window they're
displayed in.

Any hints?

Cheers,
Nico

Does the "Gridded Data" output port of the filter have both arrays? If
so you simply contour by one and color by the other. If not you have
to get the electrostatic potential into paraview somehow and then use
the probe filter to ascribe the potentials onto the isodentity
surface. Then you can color by it.

Similar to the above, it depends if the Gauss cube reader read in the
bond information from the file. If it did it would show up as cells in
the data produced on the "Output" output port. If not either our
reader needs work or you will have to convert into some other file
format that we can read well.

Message-ID: <C1142B0660A0384C9B52008C63E3685A0101B7@exchange2.pc.mayahtt.ca>

Hello all,

I have a time series of Unstructured XML files that I display in Paraview. It works fine. Each .vtu file contains geometry and data.

During my time series, the geometry (i.e. the mesh) does not change at all. It is possible to somehow only specify the changing data in subsequent files rather than also including the geometry? I realize that such files would not be readable on their own, so maybe it's a reason not to do it. But still, it would save a lot of I/O time and disk space as well if it were possible. Any suggestions?

Thanks,

Charles Boivin

	2010.
Message-ID: <CAGHqh5Jyx8xiqGLibeGdMcE2M_9uZGSt_oYtqwvxRDBR58ZUCA@mail.gmail.com>

I get the following error when compiling Paraview 3.12 on Visual
Studio Express 2010.
<< fatal error C1083: Cannot open include file: 'vtkPVMessage.pb.h':
No such file or directory >>

Following other messages on this mailing-list I gathered that this has
something to do with Protobuf (whatever that is). So I checked the
messages related to protobuf and found this message:
4>------ Build started: Project: protobuf_code_generation,
Configuration: Release Win32 ------
4>  Generating vtkPVMessage.pb.h, vtkPVMessage.pb.cc

So in theory the file should exist, but it doesnt.

Can anyone help me out with this? Is this a Paraview problem, or a
Cmake problem, or a VS Express 2010 problem?
I'm compiling without MPI support (because that generates a whole
other bunch of problems) could that have something to do with my
problem?

Saludos/greetings,

Francisco Caraballo

ResetCamera() will position the camera so that all visible objects fit in
the view.  You can control the view direction by setting the
view.CameraPosition and view.CameraFocalPoint properties.  You don't have
to set the properties to any useful values, I usually set position to 0,0,0
and CameraFocalPoint to the view direction, say [1,0,0] to look along the X
axis, then ResetCamera() will figure out where to put the camera while
keeping the view direction intact.

Please keep the discussion on the mailing list so everyone can
contribute and benefit.

The AppendAttributes filter will take in two data sets with the same
topology and produce one that has the union of their arrays.

And I mislead you about the name of the filter for a probe technique.
What you want is the ResampleWithDataset filter, which takes in a
field on the "Input" input port and some geometry on the "Source"
input port and produces a copy of the source's geometry with data
values coming from the input field.

The vtk XML file formats can not do that. Search the mailing list for
previous discussions on that feature request.

One file format I know of that will allow you to do it is XDMF, there
are probably others.

Subject: [Paraview] streaming data to Paraview
Message-ID: <EDE4418F-7C4C-4EF9-B8AF-673AE017067B@gmail.com>

Hi,
Is there a recommended way to stream data to Paraview and while in a loop, consume the data and render it? It seems that I can create new Readers, but the examples seem to imply that the Reader opens a file, reads data and renders it. I am transmitting data from a supercomputer and I want to receive data in Paraview and render it.

Thanks for any pointers.

Bruce

I think Pat Marion's live data extensions to coprocessing and John
Biddiscombe's computational steering work are the most recent
contenders to doing this.

Sorry for taking the discussion out of the mailing list! I hadn't noticed.
I tried with the Resample filter and it worked.
For future use, I summarize what I did:
1. open first cube file (containing the density);
2. plot the isodensity surface;
3. open second cube file (containing the electrostatic potential);
4. use Resample With Dataset filter. Select Gridded Data of the second cube
file as Input and Contour of the first cube file as Source.
This should do it.
Thank you again for your answers

Andreas,

What you are doing is indeed the right way, alas there seems to be a
bug in the controlling the "Visibility". I've reported a bug:

Just to add that we have added more chemistry to VTK, in the form of
Blue Obelisk Data Repository for atom colors, radii, symbols, names,
etc along with things like a vtkMolecule data structure and a simple
bond perceiver. This should hopefully gain some exposure in future
ParaView releases so that it is easier to view molecular structure and
related data.

That crash sounds like it could be a bug.  I vaguely recall recent similar
reports about crashes and animations, but I have not been following them.
Perhaps someone else on the list can report.


Is there any chance you can update to the latest version of ParaView
(3.14)?  I wouldn't want anyone chasing a bug that has already been fixed.

Any reason you're not using 3.14? I'm not sure if this is a known
issue with 3.12, but we haven't seen this with 3.14 unless using
cmake.

Dear all,
I have been using the precompiled version downlodable from the website. I
wanted to compile it from scratch for my system, everything went well both
in the configuration step and build step. Unfortunately, when I run
ParaView I get the following messages:

I could try with 3.14, but I am using cmake.
What do you mean with "unless using cmake".That if I am using cmake
3.14 wont work either?

Saludos greetings,

I see.
Well, ResetCamera() seems to deliver okay results only after Show()
has been called -- OpenDataFile() doesn't suffice.
Another misconception of mine was that CameraPosition and
CameraFocalPoint could be set to anything. My data files contain flat
surfaces in the x-y-plane, and ResetCamera() won't show anything if
CameraPosition==[0,0,0] and CameraFocalPoint=[0,0,1]. This, again,
makes sense. Setting CameraPosition to [0,0,1], for example, fixes
this.

ResetCamera() still leaves a wide border around the object. Is it
possible to rid of those, too?

Cheers,
Nico

Hey Nico,

I've had to fine tune the rendering in python scripts in the past and a 
strategy that has worked passably for me where my data lies in an axis 
aligned plane is to get the bounds of the object I want to focus on then 
set the camera position, focal point , up, and view based on that. here 
are some excerpts. I'm sure this could be improved, note I use a 
variable called camFac to make adjustments. hope it helps.

rep = Show(bovr)
rep.Representation = 'Outline'

# run the pipeline here to get the bounds
Render()

bounds = bovr.GetDataInformation().GetBounds()
bounds_dx = bounds[1] - bounds[0]
bounds_dy = bounds[3] - bounds[2]
bounds_dz = bounds[5] - bounds[4]
bounds_cx = (bounds[0] + bounds[1])/2.0
bounds_cy = (bounds[2] + bounds[3])/2.0
bounds_cz = (bounds[4] + bounds[5])/2.0

if (bounds_dx == 0):
   # yz
   dimMode = 2
   aspect = bounds_dz/bounds_dy

elif (bounds_dy == 0):
   # xz
   dimMode = 1
   aspect = bounds_dz/bounds_dx

elif (bounds_dz == 0):
   #xy
   dimMode = 0
   aspect = bounds_dy/bounds_dx

else:
   #3d
   dimMode = 3
   aspect = 1.0 # TODO

lastObj = bovr

view = GetRenderView()
view.ViewTime = steps[step]
view.UseOffscreenRenderingForScreenshots = 0

rep = Show(lastObj)
rep.Representation = 'Outline'
Render()

# position the camera
far  = config.camFac
near = 0

if (dimMode == 0):
   # xy
   pos = max(bounds_dx, bounds_dy)
   camUp = [0.0, 1.0, 0.0]
   camPos = [bounds_cx, bounds_cy,  pos*far]
   camFoc = [bounds_cx, bounds_cy, -pos*near]

elif (dimMode == 1):
   # xz
   pos = max(bounds_dx, bounds_dz)
   camUp = [0.0, 0.0, 1.0]
   camPos = [bounds_cx, -pos*far,  bounds_cz]
   camFoc = [bounds_cx,  pos*near, bounds_cz]

elif (dimMode == 2):
   # yz
   pos = max(bounds_dy, bounds_dz)
   camUp = [0.0, 0.0, 1.0]
   camPos = [ pos*far, bounds_cy, bounds_cz]
   camFoc = [-pos*near, bounds_cy, bounds_cz]

else:
   # 3d
   print '3d cam position is yet TODO'

view = GetRenderView()
view.CameraViewUp = camUp
view.CameraPosition = camPos
view.CameraFocalPoint = camFoc
view.UseOffscreenRenderingForScreenshots = 0
view.CenterAxesVisibility = 0

ren = Render()

width = int(config.outputWidth)
height = int(config.outputWidth*aspect)

ren.ViewSize = [width, height]

outputFileName = '%s%06d.png'%(config.outputBaseFileName, step)
WriteImage(outputFileName)

Looks like a weird driver bug or something. I could not reproduce the
issue on my Linux box (Debian). Does the same happen with 3.12?

Hi Utkarsh.

No, the behavior of PV 3.12 Linux 64 bits or Windows 32 bits is correct 
(see my first mail about this subject).

The behavior of PV 3.14 is also correct in the Windows 32 bits version.

The strange unexpected lines appear only in the "Surface with Edges" 
mode of PV 3.14 Linux 64 bits while its "Wireframe" mode remains 
correct. But I must say that this problem occurs only for certain 
surfaces such as the one I have sent in my second mail in a gzipped 
file. I had tried to build another test surface with "strange" double 
curvature and the view was OK !!!

The Nvidia graphic card driver on my Linux x86-64 workstation may have 
been automatically updated recently. The actual driver is 190.42 but it 
seems OK for all view modes of PV 3.12 and also for all view modes other 
than "Surfaces with Edges" of PV 3.14 (the LIC plugin works well, and I 
remember that it was the most sensitive to driver versions).

Best regards.

Richard.

Is there some sort of guide about this part of the VTK code? I mean, I am
working with an electronic structure package and it would be great if there
was a way to "interface" it with ParaView.

The problem is that a tool (namely, protoc.exe) isn't being run
correctly to generate the needed files. Can you to apply the attached
patch to see if that helps solve the problem? You'll have to apply it
to the 3.14.0 source code.

Subject: [Paraview] Superimposing two raw (binary) file variables
Message-ID: <CAD3BAHtX-Ehu0M47AuwCAqe+yHbaW2tehOs+iDf3JUDgfUS9qw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am fairly novice to paraview post-processing.
I read raw binary files to post-process different variables separately -
e.g. plot  variable 'u' and its space derivative 'du/dx' saperately.

I need to read both the variables simultaneously.
I would like to to plot the space derivative 'du/dx' superimposed with
variable 'u' to obtain a deformed behaviour.

Is it possible to superimpose two variables? Please share your expertise.

Thanks,
Rakesh

This work was only recently merged into VTK, and is not exposed in
ParaView at all right now. We are working on additional chemical
structure visualization and analysis in dedicated applications, and
adding features to VTK where appropriate. Right now there is not much
more than a small set of chemistry classes.

What package are you using? I am interested in the type of work you
are doing, and how you are currently using ParaView.

I applied it, ran cmake again from the beggining and tried building
again, but it didnt work, same error.
Is there any way I can validate the patch was applied correctly? I did
it using <<git apply file.patch>> but it didnt print any success
message.

Thanks a lot for all the help!

Saludos/greetings,

Francisco Caraballo

Hello Ken,

I downloaded version3.14, because I had problems. But the with 
version3.14 I couldn't properly
adjust the color map. I need to make a distinction between ocean and 
land. With version3.10 this
is not a problem. The new version seems can't make a sharp border which 
is important to make
a proper map of the world. I don't know anybody has the same problem or not.

Thanks a lot!

Cheers,
Xueli

The package is DIRAC and is dedicated to relativistic calculations. For our
purposes we produce cube files, that is we simply calculate the properties
to be visualized on a grid of points and then print to file. As I said,
this is ok if you want to plot one thing at a time but for more elaborate
things it's too cumbersome (in my opinion).
For example, Molekel can't do that. Molden can in principle, but I didn't
manage to do it. So I thought about ParaView.
Since we are free to choose whatever format for the visualization output, I
was really interested in this vtkMolecule facility. If we could provide to
ParaView some kind of "native" format things would be much easier. In my
case, I would like to visualize:
1. atoms and bonds;
2. isodensity surfaces;
3. isodensity surfaces color mapped with the electrostatic potential;
4. isosurfaces for the electrostatic potential.

However, in general, we would be interested in plotting molecular orbitals,
magnetic current densities and so on.

Hi,

I have some Problems compiling ParaView under cygwin with mingw compilers. It stucks with the following message:

Can you be more specific about that?  I can still make sharp transitions
in the color map.  It looks like the new version might have added a
feature to merge coincident control points, but you can still make them
some delta apart and have a sharp transition.

Paul,

I verified that the option was never available (at least since 3.10,
didn't test before that). The rationale is that pvpython would be used
as a "client" similar to the Qt GUI, in which case offscreen option is
never presented. With pvbatch, you are going to be using it as a batch
processor, and hence the option can be useful and hence provided.

Ok. Next, can you try to locate protoc.exe under the ParaView build
tree and manually run it? You may get some missing dlls errors and
those are the ones we need to identify. In the mean time I'm going to
try to see if we can build protoc.exe statically without any
dependencies to ensure that it runs cleanly always.

Better yet, can you try the attached patches please? What I've done is
removed the dependency of protoc.exe on these unnecessary extra
libraries making it possible to avoid such traps.

Patch the files as follows (from ParaView Source Tree):

# discard any changes from previous patches
> git checkout -f

> git apply paraview.patch

> cd Utilities/protobuf
> git apply protobuf.patch

Hopefully, this should solve the issue. If all works, I'll push this
to git and we can have these changes in the next release of ParaView.
Thanks a lot for helping track this one down.

I didn't originally get the code via git, so git checkout -f is not
working. Should I restore the whole Paraview 3.14 tree to what I
originally downloaded and then apply the new patches?

Saludos/greetings,

In that case, just put the two attached files in the source tree as
follows (ensure that you replace the exisiting files):

PV.CMakeLists.txt ==>
<ParaViewSource>/ParaViewCore/ServerImplementation/CMakeLists.txt
PROTOBUF.CMakeLists.txt ==>
<ParaViewSource>/Utilities/protobuf/src/CMakeLists.txt

Francisco,

Hopefully this should do it. I tested on my Windows build as well and
seems to work as expected.

Attached as the new set of files to be placed as follows:
PV.CMakeLists.txt ==>
  <ParaViewSource>/ParaViewCore/ServerImplementation/CMakeLists.txt
PROTOBUF.CMakeLists.txt ==>
 <ParaViewSource>/Utilities/protobuf/CMakeLists.txt
PROTOBUF.src.CMakeLists.txt ==>
 <ParaViewSource>/Utilities/protobuf/src/CMakeLists.txt

Any more details to reproduce the issue? Can you reproduce it with
Wavelet source? I tried with Wavelet and seems to work fine.

Subject: [Paraview] transient chombo data files
Message-ID: <CAOcpu7BNP5pJuMW=aUr7v=TBesJSauLnktcBcJoqmFQV9FMAXg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all. I've been using paraview to read sets of transient chombo data
files that were written for VisIt. I manage to read all the .hdf5 files,
but I can't make paraview understand the files as a time series. VisIt has
an additional file which just lists the names of the files in time-order.
How can I do something like that in paraview?

Thanks in advance

Hi Dominik,

Just curious, but does your output resemble the pics in this bug report?

Ok, I hadn't realized. I'm still not totally sure what the difference
between pvpython and pvbatch is (or why both are needed...)

Thanks,

Pvpython has an interactive shell, is a single process, and can connect to
any server. It's the client in other words just without the GUI.

Pvbatch exists as a means to give the parallel server a predefined script
to process. It is part of the server and thus can not be interacted with,
nor can it establish connections to other servers. It is the only option on
big hpc machines without sockets for the client and server to connect
through.

Hi Bruce,

What type of data are you sending?  How are you currently transmitting it?
Are to collecting the data to a single node and transmitting it, or do send
pieces from many nodes?  Are you familiar with using pvserver with mpi, or
do you use paraview gui standalone?  If you're prepared to compile and link
ParaView (basically VTK plus python, no GUI components) with your code that
runs on the supercomputer, then the ParaView coprocessor with the
live-visualization configuration might be a good fit.  Here's a demo
video-  http://patmarion.com/pv/live-vis.mp4

Message-ID: <4F670049.603@gfz-potsdam.de>

Hello,

I have a set of points and polylines. Each has its own name or label. 
The question is how to represent this data such that I could visualize 
them with names shown next to the object on the screen?
Thanks.

Hello Alexander,

If your names or labels are points of cells properties, try using the
"selection inspector" to display the labels. You just select
everything and turn on labeling in the selection inspector gui.
You can also select only the parts where you want to see the labels.
If you don't want your labels to show up on all the points or cells,
you replace the labels with an empty string ("") at the locations
where you want nothing to be displayed.

There might be newer and easier ways of achieving the same that I am
not aware of.

Hi.

Now I'm trying to control ParaView's camera angle
with Python.
I could get Active Camera object by GetActiveCamera()
and try SetPosition() etc.
But I Couldn't find function as "Center of Rotation"
on Adjust Camera panel.
How can I control it with Python?

And also I want to get a ParaView's Python reference.
We can find scripting tutorials on Users' Guide or Wiki,
but it's very difficult to find unpopular functions.
Is there a document on which all Python functions
are introduced?

Nehme,

Thank you, but this is a bit like a hack. Moreover, if I have 1000 of points in this way you can label them by index, but they have more meaningful names actually. It would be nice if there exists another way to do that.

The labels don't have to be indexes, you can choose any of the
attribute arrays on the cells or points to show. If one of the arrays
contains string names, those will show up just fine.

Like Nehme indicates, there are ways to choose what to show exactly, but you
have to be creative with your filters and selections to do so. And
yes, the interface to labeling in ParaView is hackish.

It comes up on the mailing list frequently, but unfortunately no one
has yet had the time to make a good text label representation and
GUI for it in ParaView.

David,

Unfortunately I don't quite follow your idea.
Let's say I have this csv file:

2268.113314,5643.431169,200.05,r1c
2458.113314,5529.431169,200.05,r2s
2639.113314,5430.431169,200.05,r3c
2880.113314,5306.431169,200.05,r4s
3280.113314,5175.431169,200.05,r5c
3463.113314,5182.431169,200.05,r6s
3621.113314,5092.431169,200.05,r7c
4050.113314,5363.431169,200.05,r8s
4229.113314,5427.431169,200.05,r9c
4596.113314,5316.431169,200.05,r10s

So last column contains labels of points.
I load this to paraview and using TableToPoints filter display points.
What to do to show labels?

Nothing exhaustive, but that maybe a good idea. In general you can
always do help(object) to discover properties, or use tracing
mechanism to determine how to change a particular entity.

Hello Dragos,

I think you may create manually your point set, and then use the "Resample
with Dataset" Filter.

Hi Ann,

You said you were importing a serie of CSV Files.
So the data type were a MultiBlockDataSet ?

Then you should iterate over all the blocks :


> id = self.GetInput()

 od = self.GetOutput()
> od.ShallowCopy(id)
>
> iter = od.NewIterator()
> iter.UnRegister(None)
> iter.InitTraversal()
> while not iter.IsDoneWithTraversal():
>    bloc = iter.GetCurrentDataObject()
>    bloc.GetPointData().RemoveArray('Name')
>    iter.GoToNextItem()
>

Regards,

A.Marsan

Subject: [Paraview] Excluding elements from plot
Message-ID: <4F676561.3060305@grs-sim.de>

Hi everyone,

I am visualizing finite element data with Paraview.
Is there a possibility to exclude mesh points (or probably rather 
elements) from being plotted when they have a certain value?

More specifically: In my data I have a very large amount of zero values. 
Can I force somehow that these are not plotted at all (e.g. in a 2D 
slice with surface representation)? What would be a suitable filter?

Thanks in advance!
Andreas

On Ubuntu 11.10, With Paraview 3.12 and 3.14 downloaded as a binary
(tar.gz), I dont see this feature. Does it need to be enabled somehow?
Its supposed to be added since last year.

Strange. It worked for me just fine with 3.14.0 binaries on debian. I
wonder if it's some OpenGL related issue. Are your drivers up-to-date?

Subject: [Paraview] Problem building in windows with MPI support
Message-ID: <CAGHqh5JTCfNvooOESJFAuCnfJHyhp9yLPn0nP9sPhMyUvmktzw@mail.gmail.com>

There's  a problem with the solution generated by CMAKE to build
paraview 3.14 in windows if you enable the flag PARAVIEW_USE_MPI. I'm
building with VS Express 2010.

It adds the following library as a dependency for the VS projects
'C:\Program Files (x86)\MPICH2\lib\mpi.lib C:\Program Files
(x86)\MPICH2\lib\cxx.lib' but this should be two entries separated by
a semi-colon. The linker then fails because obviously it cannot find
that file.
Any ideas?

Saludos/greetings,

Francisco Caraballo

Subject: [Paraview] Problem with python_calculator - global_max()
Message-ID: <4F678F0F.2050805@gmail.com>

Dear Paraview users,

I am visualizing 3-d scalar data(like pressure field). I visualizing 
iso-surface of this data with contour filter and want the maximum value 
of the scalar field to be displayed on screen. This is further animated.

Steps I follow:

pressure_data -> celldata_to_pointdata -> python_calculator 
max_pres=global_max(pressure_data), copy arrays selected.

"max_pres" shows the right data. But when I use contour filter on 
"python_calculator", values of "max_pres" become corrupted(i.e, show 
different value in information window of contour filter). Can anyone 
tell me why this happens?

And I am not understanding how to display "max_pres" value on my screen. 
Maybe its easy to do it but I am just stuck :(

Can anyone help me with this?

Thanks a lot in advance!!


Regards
Manu

Subject: [Paraview] Ply visualization







Dear all,
I'd like visualize fields associated to my mesh nodes, stored in a .PLY file. Each field is a float property of vertices, but, as far as I can see, ParaView doesn't see them.
For example, in this ply I added a fourth 'temperature' field, but I can't find it in the User Interface. Is there a way to see this field (and additional ones) without dropping the ply format?
Thank you,
Fabrizio

Dear Utkarsh,


Thanks for your advice.
I could surely get view object and set center of rotation.

...And I found input assistant by hitting tab key
on Python editor.
It's very useful to find unknown properties!

I'm not familiar with the details of the format, but looking at the
implementation (vtkPLYReader), it's only reading in a fixed set of
face attributes viz. intensity, r,g,b.

Hi,

Is the correct citation for Paraview still:

Henderson, A. ParaView Guide, A Parallel Visualization Application.
Kitware Inc., 2007.

and is it still the book at:

http://www.amazon.com/ParaView-Guide-Parallel-Visualization-Application/dp/1930934149

(it says it was published 2004).

Apologies if this information has been posted somewhere recently, I can't
seem to find it.

Thanks,
Tristan

Message-ID: <4F697579.9090309@in.tum.de>

Hello ,
i am currently running paraview in tile-screen mode. Currently i 
implemented a N:M redistribution application which streams data to all 
vis nodes. The N side is located on a Bluegene machine and M is 8 i want 
to scale the number of processors on the M Side . What is the best way 
to do this and keep the tiles mode? Can i use the dataserver mode , too? 
When I start the dataserver everything looks fine but after dropping an 
object the application crashes. Another issuer what i have is the Volume 
Renderer in Tiled-Screen mode.

Hi

I have a crash both in ParaView 3.12 and 3.14 when trying to view large
file.
When I try similar file but of smaller size data are visible.

In ParaView 3.12 I select "Edit" -> "Find Data" -> "Find: Point" ->
"volume_scalars is >= 1"
I attached screenshot in file ParaView3_12_0_crash.png which I obtain when
executing query.

In ParaView 3.14 i select "Edit" -> "Find Data" -> "Find: Point" -> Query
is "volume_scalars >= 1"
It does not crash, but data are not selected and I obtain error connected
with memory, I attached details in file "ParaView3_14_0_MemoryError.txt"

I suppose that this is because of memory limitation.
Can I increase ParaView memory limit? Or are there other ways to resolve
the issue?

Test file is following:

# vtk DataFile Version 2.1
Test Output
ASCII
DATASET STRUCTURED_POINTS
DIMENSIONS 76 131 46
SPACING 1 1 1
ORIGIN 185 185 -40
POINT_DATA 457976

LOOKUP_TABLE default
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 .... (a lot of 0
and 127 values follows)

(Overall file size is 342 Mb)

Best wishes,
Sergiy

To get rid of those points you can use the Threshold filter and then view
that.  Some grid types support blanking (soon all of them should) that
could be put into your writer to specify that but I think the Threshold
filter is the easiest way to go.

On small grid I obtained expected result.
But on large one ParaView crashes because it is unable to allocate memory.
I attached screenshot.

There is no filter to my knowledge that does what you ask.  However, assuming that your two curves have the same number of points in the same order, I think you achieve what you want by passing both to the Python Calculator and using the following expression:

mag(inputs[0].Points - inputs[1].Points)

I hope that's clear.

Subject: [Paraview] Assistance/Suggestion With Animating Relatively Small
 Datasets Over Many Timesteps
Message-ID: <OF79F2D57B.39FB0997-ON852579C9.00570D9B-852579C9.005918D7@faa.gov>

     This is my first experience posting to the ParaView Mailing List; as 
well as my first project I am exploring with ParaView.  I hope I am 
posting this question to the correct audience.

     I am attempting to create an animation of our Solar System - at an 
extremely high update interval - perhaps plotting the position and 
velocity of significant solar system bodies over 165 Earth years at
a one day interval.  Initially I thought I would be able to work with CSV 
files to define a dataset which includes time, positional coordinates, and 
velocity vectors.  While testing this approach I managed to use the 
TableToPoints filter to create a visualization of a sample dataset; but I 
was not able to sequence over the individual timesteps.  So in effect you 
see all the positions a particular planet was at for the entire duration 
of the dataset.

I created a video of this test and made it available online:
     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPxx-2Zc9Q 

     Next I thought perhaps the CSV format was a little too general for 
what I needed, so I read the VTK file format document and migrated over to 
the XML VTK format.  It seems like there is no way to define time 
sequenced data natively within the file format itself?  ParaView expects 
the user to break the timesteps into individual files - with a numeric 
indicator in the filename to define the sequence.  If I were to take this 
approach, I could be looking at creating nearly 500,000 individual files 
to represent the entire duration of time I'm interested in plotting.  I 
feel like there must be a better way to do this.

     As a small improvement I thought I could at least combine all of the 
unique solar system bodies (Earth, Sun, etc.), into a single timestep file 
such as this:
          (filename: timeseries_2455562.vtu)

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<VTKFile type="UnstructuredGrid" version="0.1" byte_order="LittleEndian"

        <DataArray Name="types" type="UInt8" format="ascii">1 
1</DataArray>
      </Cells>
    </Piece>
  </UnstructuredGrid>
</VTKFile>

The idea of this approach was to list all of the scalars and vectors for 
each corresponding body in a single file.  In this example the first 
listed scalar, vector, or coordinate point, is the Earth while the second 
set of values indicates the Sun's data.  By combining the bodies into a 
single file I could reduce the 500,000 files required down to some 60,000 
files....still undesirable but better.

However I would also like to segment the Points once inside the ParaView 
environment; so I can create a distinct pipeline for each body in the 
dataset.  One application for this would be to allow different Glyph 
rendering rules for the Sun and the Earth so I can make the Sun...have a 
Sun texture - and the Earth an Earth texture. 

After experimenting with this for awhile I found myself trying to 
implement a Programmable Filter.  The filter would take the Unstructured 
Grid for the given timestep, and given an index, extract the Point, 
Scalar, and Vector data from its input - then set only those values to the 
Output Unstructured Grid.  I currently have a script that looks something 
like this:

# CELLID 0 = EARTH
cellId = 0

# Obtain References To Input/Output Data
gridI = self.GetUnstructuredGridInput()
gridO = self.GetUnstructuredGridOutput()
dataI = self.GetInput()
dataO = self.GetOutput()
scalarI = dataI.GetPointData().GetScalars()
vectorI = dataI.GetPointData().GetVectors()

# Initialize Local Storage Arrays
newVector = vtk.vtkFloatArray()
newVector.SetName(vectorI.GetName())
newVector.SetNumberOfComponents(3)
newScalar = vtk.vtkFloatArray()
newScalar.SetName(scalarI.GetName())
newPoint = vtk.vtkPoints()
newPoint.SetNumberOfPoints(1)
newCell = vtk.vtkCellArray()

# Lookup CellId References
idCell = gridI.GetCell(cellId)
idCellType = gridI.GetCellType(cellId)
idPoint = gridI.GetPoints().GetPoint(cellId)
idScalar = scalarI.GetTuple(cellId)
idVector = vectorI.GetTuple(cellId)

# Populate New Local Cell Array with CellId Cell
newCell.InsertNextCell(idCell)

# Populate New Local Point Array With CellId Point
newPoint.SetPoint(0, idPoint)

# Populate New Local Scalars with CellId Scalar Tuples
newScalar.InsertNextTuple(idScalar)

# Populate New Local Vectors with CellID Vector Tuples
newVector.InsertNextTuple(idVector)

# Copy Local Cells, Scalars, Vectors, and Points Into Output Pipeline Data
gridO.SetPoints(newPoint)
gridO.SetCells(idCellType, newCell)
dataO.GetPointData().SetScalars(newScalar)
dataO.GetPointData().SetVectors(newVector)

The filter does achieve the desired effect for the cellID 0 - but when I 
switch the value of cellID to 1 (which should refer to the Sun's index) 
ParaView crashes hard - where I assume I am missing something, possibly 
requesting something out of bounds in memory.

I've been struggling with this problem for a little while now and thought 
to share my progress here; hopefully there is somebody out there with a 
little more insight that could help guide me towards either a conclusion 
with this implementation or a suggestion for a better approach.

Essentially - How can one give ParaView Point and Velocity vectors over a 
vast sequence of time without creating potentially hundreds of thousands 
of files on disc?  Does this Programmable Filter seem like a reasonable 
approach?  Is there a native feature I am missing that does this already? 
Is there some other file format other than VTK I could use to have 
ParaView understand this format of data?

Any thoughts, comments, or questions will be greatly appreciated.  :)

Thanks,
     John

How about using a Transform Filter, possibly using scripting? Not sure if that works with timesteps, but I suppose it can be done.

I made the following example for someone on the list recently, that shows animation of a transformfilter:

gridO.SetCells(idCellType, newCell)
dataO.GetPointData().SetScalars(newScalar)

The filter does achieve the desired effect for the cellID 0 - but when I switch the value of cellID to 1 (which should refer to the Sun's index) ParaView crashes hard - where I assume I am missing something, possibly requesting something out of bounds in memory.

I've been struggling with this problem for a little while now and thought to share my progress here; hopefully there is somebody out there with a little more insight that could help guide me towards either a conclusion with this implementation or a suggestion for a better approach.

Essentially - How can one give ParaView Point and Velocity vectors over a vast sequence of time without creating potentially hundreds of thousands of files on disc?  Does this Programmable Filter seem like a reasonable approach?  Is there a native feature I am missing that does this already?  Is there some other file format other than VTK I could use to have ParaView understand this format of data?

Any thoughts, comments, or questions will be greatly appreciated.  :)

Thanks,

Subject: [Paraview] pvbatch and paraview to extract images and data.
Message-ID: <CAA-3NMeNBfSrJOhTPZpNzR0BG8gbcHLryioKizdAAGPcUyEiZA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,

I have been recently experimenting with OpenFOAM and paraview, in
particular pvbatch. In particular, I am interested in exporting images and
data from paraview, using pvbatch.

To this end, I do the following:

[1] Run OpenFOAM and generate the required "state file" in paraview (say
pressure.pvsm)
[2] Run "pvbatch extract.py", where my extract.py looks as follows:

from paraview.simple import *
servermanager.LoadState("/home/jameswh/OpenFOAM/ram-2.1.0/run/tutorials/incompressible/icoFoam/cavity/pressure.pvsm")
GetActiveSource()
SetActiveView(GetRenderView())
Render()
WriteImage("/home/ram/image1.png")

and it works fine. However, I have two fundamental problems:

[1] If I change my input to OpenFOAM, and run the above (extract.py), the
images are not scaled to the correct units (pressure). How can I
automatically rescale the results value? So, say for case 1 run, my min and
max are 5 and 10, for case 2 run, my min and max and 10 and 20. However,
since Iam using the pvsm from case 1, my images in case 2 also show 5 and
10, rather than 10 and 20. I found the "properties" tag in the *.pvsm file,
and I notice that the values are "hard coded" How can I say "scale values
automatically"? I hope my question is clear.

[2] Secondly, I would like to write out values using "Save Data", and I am
looking for an equivalent of "save data" in pvbatch. I tried doing a python
trace, but, when I do a Save Data, it does not seem to track/trace anything.

If anyone has encountered the above problems, and possibly have a solution,
Id be glad if you could point me in the right direction.

Thank you for your time.

First, thank you for the quick response I appreciate the input.

I took at look at the state file you provided, and my first thoughts are 
suggesting that the Transform Filter may not provide exactly what I need. 

In your example you are using the Animation Control to interpolate 
parameters of the Transform Filter over time.  However I don't believe 
that any of the functions exposed 
by the Transform filter will help me actually remove Points along with the 
data in their associated Data Arrays. 

In terms of viewing the "Information" tab in the Object Inspector - I have 
a Dataset which has 2 Points, Several Arrays of Length 2 - and I would 
like to create multiple filters; each 
which would contain only 1 Point with Data Arrays of size 1. 

Would it be helpful if I provided a state file with my test datasets?

How about using a Transform Filter, possibly using scripting? Not sure if 
that works with timesteps, but I suppose it can be done.
 
I made the following example for someone on the list recently, that shows 
animation of a transformfilter:

Subject: [Paraview] Assistance/Suggestion With Animating Relatively Small 
Datasets Over Many Timesteps
 

     This is my first experience posting to the ParaView Mailing List; as 
well as my first project I am exploring with ParaView.  I hope I am 
posting this question to the correct audience. 

     I am attempting to create an animation of our Solar System - at an 
extremely high update interval - perhaps plotting the position and 
velocity of significant solar system bodies over 165 Earth years at 
a one day interval.  Initially I thought I would be able to work with CSV 
files to define a dataset which includes time, positional coordinates, and 
velocity vectors.  While testing this approach I managed to use the 
TableToPoints filter to create a visualization of a sample dataset; but I 
was not able to sequence over the individual timesteps.  So in effect you 
see all the positions a particular planet was at for the entire duration 
of the dataset. 

I created a video of this test and made it available online: 
     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPxx-2Zc9Q 

     Next I thought perhaps the CSV format was a little too general for 
what I needed, so I read the VTK file format document and migrated over to 
the XML VTK format.  It seems like there is no way to define time 
sequenced data natively within the file format itself?  ParaView expects 
the user to break the timesteps into individual files - with a numeric 
indicator in the filename to define the sequence.  If I were to take this 
approach, I could be looking at creating nearly 500,000 individual files 
to represent the entire duration of time I'm interested in plotting.  I 
feel like there must be a better way to do this. 

     As a small improvement I thought I could at least combine all of the 
unique solar system bodies (Earth, Sun, etc.), into a single timestep file 
such as this: 
          (filename: timeseries_2455562.vtu) 

<?xml version="1.0"?> 
<VTKFile type="UnstructuredGrid" version="0.1" byte_order="LittleEndian" 
compressor="vtkZLibDataCompressor"> 
  <UnstructuredGrid> 
    <Piece NumberOfPoints="2" NumberOfCells="2"> 
      <PointData Vectors="Velocity" Scalars="Radius"> 
        <DataArray Name="Time" type="Float32" format="ascii">2455562 
2455562</DataArray> 
        <DataArray Name="Radius" type="Float32" format="ascii">6371 
696000</DataArray> 
        <DataArray Name="Velocity" type="Float32" NumberOfComponents="3" 
format="ascii"> 
          -2.982651603443954E+01 -5.304542013817379E+00 
-7.226846229160870E-04 
          0 0 0 
        </DataArray> 
      </PointData> 
      <Points> 
        <DataArray type="Float32" NumberOfComponents="3" format="ascii"> 
          -2.567030301930377E+07 1.448508985971261E+08 
-3.607762965630511E+03 
          0 0 0 
        </DataArray> 
      </Points> 
      <Cells> 
        <DataArray Name="connectivity" type="Int32" format="ascii">0 
1</DataArray> 
        <DataArray Name="offsets" type="Int32" format="ascii">1 
2</DataArray> 
        <DataArray Name="types" type="UInt8" format="ascii">1 
1</DataArray> 
      </Cells> 
    </Piece> 
  </UnstructuredGrid> 
</VTKFile> 

The idea of this approach was to list all of the scalars and vectors for 
each corresponding body in a single file.  In this example the first 
listed scalar, vector, or coordinate point, is the Earth while the second 
set of values indicates the Sun's data.  By combining the bodies into a 
single file I could reduce the 500,000 files required down to some 60,000 
files....still undesirable but better. 

However I would also like to segment the Points once inside the ParaView 
environment; so I can create a distinct pipeline for each body in the 
dataset.  One application for this would be to allow different Glyph 
rendering rules for the Sun and the Earth so I can make the Sun...have a 
Sun texture - and the Earth an Earth texture. 

After experimenting with this for awhile I found myself trying to 
implement a Programmable Filter.  The filter would take the Unstructured 
Grid for the given timestep, and given an index, extract the Point, 
Scalar, and Vector data from its input - then set only those values to the 
Output Unstructured Grid.  I currently have a script that looks something 
like this: 

# CELLID 0 = EARTH 
cellId = 0 

# Obtain References To Input/Output Data 
gridI = self.GetUnstructuredGridInput() 
gridO = self.GetUnstructuredGridOutput() 
dataI = self.GetInput() 
dataO = self.GetOutput() 
scalarI = dataI.GetPointData().GetScalars() 
vectorI = dataI.GetPointData().GetVectors() 

# Initialize Local Storage Arrays 
newVector = vtk.vtkFloatArray() 
newVector.SetName(vectorI.GetName()) 
newVector.SetNumberOfComponents(3) 
newScalar = vtk.vtkFloatArray() 
newScalar.SetName(scalarI.GetName()) 
newPoint = vtk.vtkPoints() 
newPoint.SetNumberOfPoints(1) 
newCell = vtk.vtkCellArray() 

# Lookup CellId References 
idCell = gridI.GetCell(cellId) 
idCellType = gridI.GetCellType(cellId) 
idPoint = gridI.GetPoints().GetPoint(cellId) 
idScalar = scalarI.GetTuple(cellId) 
idVector = vectorI.GetTuple(cellId) 

# Populate New Local Cell Array with CellId Cell 
newCell.InsertNextCell(idCell) 

# Populate New Local Point Array With CellId Point 
newPoint.SetPoint(0, idPoint) 

# Populate New Local Scalars with CellId Scalar Tuples 
newScalar.InsertNextTuple(idScalar) 

# Populate New Local Vectors with CellID Vector Tuples 
newVector.InsertNextTuple(idVector) 

# Copy Local Cells, Scalars, Vectors, and Points Into Output Pipeline Data 

gridO.SetPoints(newPoint) 
gridO.SetCells(idCellType, newCell) 
dataO.GetPointData().SetScalars(newScalar) 
dataO.GetPointData().SetVectors(newVector) 

The filter does achieve the desired effect for the cellID 0 - but when I 
switch the value of cellID to 1 (which should refer to the Sun's index) 
ParaView crashes hard - where I assume I am missing something, possibly 
requesting something out of bounds in memory. 

I've been struggling with this problem for a little while now and thought 
to share my progress here; hopefully there is somebody out there with a 
little more insight that could help guide me towards either a conclusion 
with this implementation or a suggestion for a better approach. 

Essentially - How can one give ParaView Point and Velocity vectors over a 
vast sequence of time without creating potentially hundreds of thousands 
of files on disc?  Does this Programmable Filter seem like a reasonable 
approach?  Is there a native feature I am missing that does this already? 
Is there some other file format other than VTK I could use to have 
ParaView understand this format of data? 

Any thoughts, comments, or questions will be greatly appreciated.  :)

                            lut.RGBPoints.SetData(newrgbpoints)
=============
You'll have to modify it some but hopefully that gives you an idea.

To save your data you'll have to specify a writer.  The most general is the
DataSetWriter with vtk file extension.  Something like XMLPolyDataWriter,
XMLUnstructuredGridWriter, etc. could also be used, depending on the output
grid type.  Then for the writer, do "<writer>.FileName = "myfilename.<ext>"
and then <writer>.UpdatePipeline().  The writer information seems like it
should be captured by the python trace but I'm not sure why it isn't.  You
may want to submit this as a bug or feature request.

=============
You'll have to modify it some but hopefully that gives you an idea.

To save your data you'll have to specify a writer.  Something like
XMLPolyDataWriter, XMLUnstructuredGridWriter, etc., depending on the output
grid type.  Then for the writer, do "<writer>.FileName = "myfilename.<ext>"
and then <writer>.UpdatePipeline().  I'm not aware of  The writer
information seems like it should be captured by the python trace but I'm
not sure why it isn't.  You may want to submit a bug report for it.

Subject: [Paraview] Load many VTK from different folders at once
Message-ID: <loom.20120322T201449-30@post.gmane.org>

Hi all,
I am using openFoam and when I run foamToVTK I get many vtk files every each 
one of which is contained in a different folder. If my geometry is made up by 
many .stl different files then I get the same number of folders. This is quite 
annoying when I need to load up the whole geometry because I need to enter 
the first folder and load the first .vtk, then go to file-->open-->enter the 
second folder and load the second .vtk and so on until I loaded all the files I 
need. As you may understand this is quite time consuming? Any way to do the
whole process at once? 

I think the best way would be to link together all of these vtk files into one 
single file (even of a different format) using a script (sh, python, bash???).

This is something you may do with the .stl files, if they are in binary format 
you may concatenate the content of each one of them into a single different 
file and then load just that one to have everything at once?

What do you think?

Thank you!

Samuel,
     Ah yes - I was hoping that another file format could make this 
process much easier.  I started looking a little at the file you provided 
me - though I don't have much time at the moment to dig too deeply into 
this - I wanted to send a quick thank-you for your response.  The storage 
schema presented by EnSight seems like it will dramatically reduce the 
number of files, and storage requirements. 

     In your reply you mentioned attaching a "copy of the EnSight format 
document".  I did not see this in the e-mail, though I did find this:
          
http://www-vis.lbl.gov/NERSC/Software/ensight/doc/OnlineHelp/UM-C11.pdf 
Is this the correct format document I should be referring to?  If so - do 
you recommend a particular casefile format to examine?  This document 
appears to cover several: EnSight Gold, EnSight6, and EnSight5. 

     My next step will be to decipher this format enough to create a 
dataset that represents an unstructured grid of coordinate X,Y,Z points 
with each point having a distinct velocity vector over my time span.  If 
you happen to have a concise example of one of referenced 'VARIABLE' files 
- such as 'fmaego.data.nvel' - I believe that would help me greatly in 
decoding the format quicker.  Otherwise no worries, I already feel like 
this is a much more tangible approach and appreciate the help you have 
already offered! 

Thank You Again,
     John

Re: [Paraview] Assistance/Suggestion With Animating Relatively Small

John,

You might try the EnSight reader in ParaView. (I have used this format for 
many multiple-part models with a common time history.) It takes a little 
time to decipher the EnSight format but once you get it to work, it is 
very easy after that. The primary concept to keep in mind is that each 
part is an independently displayable graphics object. Each datum item 
(scalar or vector values assigned to cells and points) is kept in a 
separate file that contains all time steps. This storage scheme really 
cuts down on the number of files.

Using the EnSight-format's part construct, you can use the Extract Block 
filter to create a pipeline for each object, that is, do different 
graphics operations on each part independently. 

I have attached a typical EnSight 'case' file and a copy of the EnSight 
format document. Using EnSight-formatted input gives in my opinion, easy 
access to a wide selection of very useful filters.

Enjoy

First, thank you for the quick response I appreciate the input. 

I took at look at the state file you provided, and my first thoughts are

In your example you are using the Animation Control to interpolate 
parameters of the Transform Filter over time.  However I don't believe 
that any of the functions exposed 
by the Transform filter will help me actually remove Points along with the 
data in their associated Data Arrays.   

In terms of viewing the "Information" tab in the Object Inspector - I have 
a Dataset which has 2 Points, Several Arrays of Length 2 - and I would 
like to create multiple filters; each 
which would contain only 1 Point with Data Arrays of size 1.   

Would it be helpful if I provided a state file with my test datasets?

How about using a Transform Filter, possibly using scripting? Not sure if 
that works with timesteps, but I suppose it can be done. 
  
I made the following example for someone on the list recently, that shows 
animation of a transformfilter:

Subject: [Paraview] Assistance/Suggestion With Animating Relatively Small 
Datasets Over Many Timesteps 
 

    This is my first experience posting to the ParaView Mailing List; as 
well as my first project I am exploring with ParaView.  I hope I am 
posting this question to the correct audience. 

    I am attempting to create an animation of our Solar System - at an 
extremely high update interval - perhaps plotting the position and 
velocity of significant solar system bodies over 165 Earth years at 
a one day interval.  Initially I thought I would be able to work with CSV 
files to define a dataset which includes time, positional coordinates, and 
velocity vectors.  While testing this approach I managed to use the 
TableToPoints filter to create a visualization of a sample dataset; but I 
was not able to sequence over the individual timesteps.  So in effect you 
see all the positions a particular planet was at for the entire duration 
of the dataset. 

I created a video of this test and made it available online: 
    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPxx-2Zc9Q 

    Next I thought perhaps the CSV format was a little too general for 
what I needed, so I read the VTK file format document and migrated over to 
the XML VTK format.  It seems like there is no way to define time 
sequenced data natively within the file format itself?  ParaView expects 
the user to break the timesteps into individual files - with a numeric 
indicator in the filename to define the sequence.  If I were to take this 
approach, I could be looking at creating nearly 500,000 individual files 
to represent the entire duration of time I'm interested in plotting.  I 
feel like there must be a better way to do this. 

    As a small improvement I thought I could at least combine all of the 
unique solar system bodies (Earth, Sun, etc.), into a single timestep file 
such as this: 
         (filename: timeseries_2455562.vtu) 

<?xml version="1.0"?>

       <DataArray Name="types" type="UInt8" format="ascii">1 1</DataArray> 

     </Cells> 
   </Piece> 
 </UnstructuredGrid> 
</VTKFile> 

The idea of this approach was to list all of the scalars and vectors for 
each corresponding body in a single file.  In this example the first 
listed scalar, vector, or coordinate point, is the Earth while the second 
set of values indicates the Sun's data.  By combining the bodies into a 
single file I could reduce the 500,000 files required down to some 60,000 
files....still undesirable but better. 

However I would also like to segment the Points once inside the ParaView 
environment; so I can create a distinct pipeline for each body in the 
dataset.  One application for this would be to allow different Glyph 
rendering rules for the Sun and the Earth so I can make the Sun...have a 
Sun texture - and the Earth an Earth texture. 

After experimenting with this for awhile I found myself trying to 
implement a Programmable Filter.  The filter would take the Unstructured 
Grid for the given timestep, and given an index, extract the Point, 
Scalar, and Vector data from its input - then set only those values to the 
Output Unstructured Grid.  I currently have a script that looks something 
like this: 

# CELLID 0 = EARTH 
cellId = 0 

# Obtain References To Input/Output Data 
gridI = self.GetUnstructuredGridInput() 
gridO = self.GetUnstructuredGridOutput() 
dataI = self.GetInput() 
dataO = self.GetOutput() 
scalarI = dataI.GetPointData().GetScalars() 
vectorI = dataI.GetPointData().GetVectors() 

# Initialize Local Storage Arrays 
newVector = vtk.vtkFloatArray() 
newVector.SetName(vectorI.GetName()) 
newVector.SetNumberOfComponents(3) 
newScalar = vtk.vtkFloatArray() 
newScalar.SetName(scalarI.GetName()) 
newPoint = vtk.vtkPoints() 
newPoint.SetNumberOfPoints(1) 
newCell = vtk.vtkCellArray() 

# Lookup CellId References 
idCell = gridI.GetCell(cellId) 
idCellType = gridI.GetCellType(cellId) 
idPoint = gridI.GetPoints().GetPoint(cellId) 
idScalar = scalarI.GetTuple(cellId) 
idVector = vectorI.GetTuple(cellId) 

# Populate New Local Cell Array with CellId Cell 
newCell.InsertNextCell(idCell) 

# Populate New Local Point Array With CellId Point 
newPoint.SetPoint(0, idPoint) 

# Populate New Local Scalars with CellId Scalar Tuples 
newScalar.InsertNextTuple(idScalar) 

# Populate New Local Vectors with CellID Vector Tuples 
newVector.InsertNextTuple(idVector) 

# Copy Local Cells, Scalars, Vectors, and Points Into Output Pipeline Data 

gridO.SetPoints(newPoint) 
gridO.SetCells(idCellType, newCell) 
dataO.GetPointData().SetScalars(newScalar) 
dataO.GetPointData().SetVectors(newVector) 

The filter does achieve the desired effect for the cellID 0 - but when I 
switch the value of cellID to 1 (which should refer to the Sun's index) 
ParaView crashes hard - where I assume I am missing something, possibly 
requesting something out of bounds in memory. 

I've been struggling with this problem for a little while now and thought 
to share my progress here; hopefully there is somebody out there with a 
little more insight that could help guide me towards either a conclusion 
with this implementation or a suggestion for a better approach. 

Essentially - How can one give ParaView Point and Velocity vectors over a 
vast sequence of time without creating potentially hundreds of thousands 
of files on disc?  Does this Programmable Filter seem like a reasonable 
approach?  Is there a native feature I am missing that does this already? 
Is there some other file format other than VTK I could use to have 
ParaView understand this format of data? 

Any thoughts, comments, or questions will be greatly appreciated.  :) 

Thanks, 
    John

Hi Abdul,
  I am currently doing some work comparing distributions using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test. This technique is probably not directly applicable but the basic approach may be? My understanding is the basic metric used is the vertical deviation between the two cumulative distribution curves. Perhaps this methodology can be applied to create a similarity metric for arbitrary curves? As with the KS test you may want to normalise or standardise the two curves first.

Subject: [Paraview] Comparing two curves

Hi All,
Given two curves A and B with point set A={p1,q1,r1} and B={p2,q2,r2}. I want to determine if the two curves are the same (similar) and compute the similarity score. Your kind advice will be well appreciated.
Cheer,
Abdul.

Subject: [Paraview] 3d glyphs representation
Message-ID: <CABWOrb8TujtSs--gV1x4iQuEJSU9--+bTNezLTmHHknGyo1BwQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Does anyone actually use the 3d glyph representation?  I would rather it
were to be removed and I actually remove it from my version.  Here are the
problems I have:

   - My datasets contain more than one vector and I cannot select which one
   to use
   - The scaling is never right and not configurable
   - Accidentally selecting it on very large datasets will take ages to
   render (or crash from memory usage)
   - My datasets are multiblock and if I extract just one unstructured grid
   in a multiblock structure it will be the default representation (and will
   take ages to actually render if it doesn't crash from memory usage)

Also, it is hardly any difference in effort to just click the glyph button
to apply the filter (where you can configure what to see)

If people do actually want this - how about releasing it as a plugin
instead?

Regards,
Paul

+1 for move to plugin

My understanding is that that is an unfinished feature that has
languished for several releases now. It can be much faster than the
standard cpu level vtk glyphs, because it is implemented in the GPU
space and uses instancing instead of replicated geometry memory, but
without the GUI hooks in paraview to control what is glyphed and how,
it is less than useful in my opinion.

I would stick to the CSV file if you've got all the information you need inside it

... but instead of using a table to points filter, create your own custom filter which takes the CSV table as input, and outputs just a small polydata object which has the current positions (+scalars) encoded for the given time.

All you need to do is create a RequestData function which looks at UPDATE_TIME, and fetches the corresponding rows/columns for each planet/point for that time and adds them to the output.

For added fun, you can export a multi-block dataset, and/or have a treeview which allows you to enable/disable certain planets/points. This way you can

Reader -> ExtractPlanetFilter1 ->Render (use textureA)
                    ExtractPlanetFilter2->Render (use tectureB)

[Or other combinations with ExtractBlockFilter if you use multiblock ].

The Reader would simply subclass polydataalgorithm, but take a vtkTable as input. Couple of hours work is all you'd need and you can leave the data in its current form.

Subject: [Paraview] Assistance/Suggestion With Animating Relatively Small Datasets Over Many Timesteps


     This is my first experience posting to the ParaView Mailing List; as well as my first project I am exploring with ParaView.  I hope I am posting this question to the correct audience.

     I am attempting to create an animation of our Solar System - at an extremely high update interval - perhaps plotting the position and velocity of significant solar system bodies over 165 Earth years at
a one day interval.  Initially I thought I would be able to work with CSV files to define a dataset which includes time, positional coordinates, and velocity vectors.  While testing this approach I managed to use the TableToPoints filter to create a visualization of a sample dataset; but I was not able to sequence over the individual timesteps.  So in effect you see all the positions a particular planet was at for the entire duration of the dataset.

I created a video of this test and made it available online:
     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPxx-2Zc9Q

     Next I thought perhaps the CSV format was a little too general for what I needed, so I read the VTK file format document and migrated over to the XML VTK format.  It seems like there is no way to define time sequenced data natively within the file format itself?  ParaView expects the user to break the timesteps into individual files - with a numeric indicator in the filename to define the sequence.  If I were to take this approach, I could be looking at creating nearly 500,000 individual files to represent the entire duration of time I'm interested in plotting.  I feel like there must be a better way to do this.

     As a small improvement I thought I could at least combine all of the unique solar system bodies (Earth, Sun, etc.), into a single timestep file such as this:
          (filename: timeseries_2455562.vtu)

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<VTKFile type="UnstructuredGrid" version="0.1" byte_order="LittleEndian" compressor="vtkZLibDataCompressor">
  <UnstructuredGrid>
    <Piece NumberOfPoints="2" NumberOfCells="2">

        <DataArray Name="Radius" type="Float32" format="ascii">6371 696000</DataArray>
        <DataArray Name="Velocity" type="Float32" NumberOfComponents="3" format="ascii">

          0 0 0
        </DataArray>
      </PointData>
      <Points>
        <DataArray type="Float32" NumberOfComponents="3" format="ascii">
          -2.567030301930377E+07 1.448508985971261E+08 -3.607762965630511E+03
          0 0 0
        </DataArray>
      </Points>
      <Cells>
        <DataArray Name="connectivity" type="Int32" format="ascii">0 1</DataArray>
        <DataArray Name="offsets" type="Int32" format="ascii">1 2</DataArray>
        <DataArray Name="types" type="UInt8" format="ascii">1 1</DataArray>
      </Cells>
    </Piece>
  </UnstructuredGrid>
</VTKFile>

The idea of this approach was to list all of the scalars and vectors for each corresponding body in a single file.  In this example the first listed scalar, vector, or coordinate point, is the Earth while the second set of values indicates the Sun's data.  By combining the bodies into a single file I could reduce the 500,000 files required down to some 60,000 files....still undesirable but better.

However I would also like to segment the Points once inside the ParaView environment; so I can create a distinct pipeline for each body in the dataset.  One application for this would be to allow different Glyph rendering rules for the Sun and the Earth so I can make the Sun...have a Sun texture - and the Earth an Earth texture.

After experimenting with this for awhile I found myself trying to implement a Programmable Filter.  The filter would take the Unstructured Grid for the given timestep, and given an index, extract the Point, Scalar, and Vector data from its input - then set only those values to the Output Unstructured Grid.  I currently have a script that looks something like this:

# CELLID 0 = EARTH
cellId = 0

# Obtain References To Input/Output Data
gridI = self.GetUnstructuredGridInput()
gridO = self.GetUnstructuredGridOutput()
dataI = self.GetInput()
dataO = self.GetOutput()
scalarI = dataI.GetPointData().GetScalars()
vectorI = dataI.GetPointData().GetVectors()

# Initialize Local Storage Arrays
newVector = vtk.vtkFloatArray()
newVector.SetName(vectorI.GetName())
newVector.SetNumberOfComponents(3)
newScalar = vtk.vtkFloatArray()
newScalar.SetName(scalarI.GetName())
newPoint = vtk.vtkPoints()
newPoint.SetNumberOfPoints(1)
newCell = vtk.vtkCellArray()

# Lookup CellId References
idCell = gridI.GetCell(cellId)
idCellType = gridI.GetCellType(cellId)
idPoint = gridI.GetPoints().GetPoint(cellId)
idScalar = scalarI.GetTuple(cellId)
idVector = vectorI.GetTuple(cellId)

# Populate New Local Cell Array with CellId Cell
newCell.InsertNextCell(idCell)

# Populate New Local Point Array With CellId Point
newPoint.SetPoint(0, idPoint)

# Populate New Local Scalars with CellId Scalar Tuples
newScalar.InsertNextTuple(idScalar)

# Populate New Local Vectors with CellID Vector Tuples
newVector.InsertNextTuple(idVector)

# Copy Local Cells, Scalars, Vectors, and Points Into Output Pipeline Data
gridO.SetPoints(newPoint)
gridO.SetCells(idCellType, newCell)
dataO.GetPointData().SetScalars(newScalar)
dataO.GetPointData().SetVectors(newVector)

The filter does achieve the desired effect for the cellID 0 - but when I switch the value of cellID to 1 (which should refer to the Sun's index) ParaView crashes hard - where I assume I am missing something, possibly requesting something out of bounds in memory.

I've been struggling with this problem for a little while now and thought to share my progress here; hopefully there is somebody out there with a little more insight that could help guide me towards either a conclusion with this implementation or a suggestion for a better approach.

Essentially - How can one give ParaView Point and Velocity vectors over a vast sequence of time without creating potentially hundreds of thousands of files on disc?  Does this Programmable Filter seem like a reasonable approach?  Is there a native feature I am missing that does this already?  Is there some other file format other than VTK I could use to have ParaView understand this format of data?

Any thoughts, comments, or questions will be greatly appreciated.  :)

Thanks,
     John

Ah yes,
    This is the sort of approach I was initially hoping to get 
implemented.  However I am still really stuck on how to implement some of 
those details.

A couple questions I am still trying to hammer out specifically:
  - You say "create a RequestData function"; by this do you mean the 
'RequestInformation Script' field inside of a ParaView ProgrammableFilter?
  - I have searched for longer than probably is justified for this 
already....where does Python have access to an UPDATE_TIME field?
  - How do I place the Python script in a way that it is evaluated every 
single time the ParaView UI updates it's own timestep - otherwise the 
filter won't update during an animation tick

I appreciate the response - if you have any additional thoughts on this 
I'd love to hear about them in further detail.

Best wishes!
     -Another John

Subject: [Paraview] Question on Information Objects
Message-ID: <CB91061F.1027%joshua.murphy@lasp.colorado.edu>

Hello,

I am trying to get meta-data information from a file into ParaView.  I have successfully built the information key-value pairs in the information object in my reader, but I am uncertain how to get the data out on the ParaView side of things.

Example:

I want to get the Calendar date meta-data from my model file.  I added Key to the information object to the results info object.

I set keys as follows:


  request->AppendUnique(vtkExecutive::KEYS_TO_COPY(), vtkENLILMetaDataKeys::REFDATE_CAL());


I have a function to add the value to the key like such:


void vtkENLILMetaDataKeys::populate_meta_data(vtkInformation* request, vtkInformationStringKey *key, char* value)

{

  request->Set(key, value);

}


I then add the values to the keys as follows:


  vtkENLILMetaDataKeys::populate_meta_data(outInfo, vtkENLILMetaDataKeys::REFDATE_CAL(), temp);

After I do this, I can successfully pull the placed data from the information object from within the reader.

What I cannot figure out is how to access this object from within Paraview.

My goal is to be able to include the calendar date (as text) in the render view.

Can someone guide me in the correct direction on how to do this?  I am looking for possibly a python way of getting at this data.

Thanks,

Josh

hi, information keys are more for passing info between filters through 
the pipeline. if all you want is to display a string, you could make a 
second output port to your reader that produces a vtkTable and populate 
it with the string. This could be displayed in the pv ui. here's a quick 
example of what you'd do in your request data:


315   vtkInformation *outInfo;
316   vtkTable *output;
317   vtkStringArray *data;
318
319   // output port 1 -> bw data
320   outInfo=outputVector->GetInformationObject(0);
321   output
322     = 
dynamic_cast<vtkTable*>(outInfo->Get(vtkDataObject::DATA_OBJECT()));
323   data=vtkStringArray::New();
324   data->SetName("BW Data");
325   data->SetNumberOfComponents(1);
326   data->InsertNextValue(bwData.c_str());
327   output->AddColumn(data);
328   data->Delete();

This is not something I'd use Python for. If you are not familiar with creating C++ filters then my approach will  be a bit of a stretch for you.

To get an idea - you'd grep UPDATE_TIME_STEPS in the source tree of paraview and see how it is used to fetch the current time request.

Ah yes,
    This is the sort of approach I was initially hoping to get implemented.  However I am still really stuck on how to implement some of those details.

A couple questions I am still trying to hammer out specifically:
  - You say "create a RequestData function"; by this do you mean the 'RequestInformation Script' field inside of a ParaView ProgrammableFilter?
  - I have searched for longer than probably is justified for this already....where does Python have access to an UPDATE_TIME field?
  - How do I place the Python script in a way that it is evaluated every single time the ParaView UI updates it's own timestep - otherwise the filter won't update during an animation tick

I appreciate the response - if you have any additional thoughts on this I'd love to hear about them in further detail.

Best wishes!
     -Another John

I would stick to the CSV file if you've got all the information you need inside it

... but instead of using a table to points filter, create your own custom filter which takes the CSV table as input, and outputs just a small polydata object which has the current positions (+scalars) encoded for the given time.

All you need to do is create a RequestData function which looks at UPDATE_TIME, and fetches the corresponding rows/columns for each planet/point for that time and adds them to the output.

For added fun, you can export a multi-block dataset, and/or have a treeview which allows you to enable/disable certain planets/points. This way you can

Reader -> ExtractPlanetFilter1 ->Render (use textureA)
                    ExtractPlanetFilter2->Render (use tectureB)

[Or other combinations with ExtractBlockFilter if you use multiblock ].

The Reader would simply subclass polydataalgorithm, but take a vtkTable as input. Couple of hours work is all you'd need and you can leave the data in its current form.

Subject: [Paraview] Assistance/Suggestion With Animating Relatively Small Datasets Over Many Timesteps


    This is my first experience posting to the ParaView Mailing List; as well as my first project I am exploring with ParaView.  I hope I am posting this question to the correct audience.

    I am attempting to create an animation of our Solar System - at an extremely high update interval - perhaps plotting the position and velocity of significant solar system bodies over 165 Earth years at
a one day interval.  Initially I thought I would be able to work with CSV files to define a dataset which includes time, positional coordinates, and velocity vectors.  While testing this approach I managed to use the TableToPoints filter to create a visualization of a sample dataset; but I was not able to sequence over the individual timesteps.  So in effect you see all the positions a particular planet was at for the entire duration of the dataset.

I created a video of this test and made it available online:
    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPxx-2Zc9Q

    Next I thought perhaps the CSV format was a little too general for what I needed, so I read the VTK file format document and migrated over to the XML VTK format.  It seems like there is no way to define time sequenced data natively within the file format itself?  ParaView expects the user to break the timesteps into individual files - with a numeric indicator in the filename to define the sequence.  If I were to take this approach, I could be looking at creating nearly 500,000 individual files to represent the entire duration of time I'm interested in plotting.  I feel like there must be a better way to do this.

    As a small improvement I thought I could at least combine all of the unique solar system bodies (Earth, Sun, etc.), into a single timestep file such as this:
         (filename: timeseries_2455562.vtu)

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<VTKFile type="UnstructuredGrid" version="0.1" byte_order="LittleEndian" compressor="vtkZLibDataCompressor">
 <UnstructuredGrid>
   <Piece NumberOfPoints="2" NumberOfCells="2">
     <PointData Vectors="Velocity" Scalars="Radius">
       <DataArray Name="Time" type="Float32" format="ascii">2455562 2455562</DataArray>
       <DataArray Name="Radius" type="Float32" format="ascii">6371 696000</DataArray>
       <DataArray Name="Velocity" type="Float32" NumberOfComponents="3" format="ascii">
         -2.982651603443954E+01 -5.304542013817379E+00 -7.226846229160870E-04
         0 0 0
       </DataArray>
     </PointData>
     <Points>
       <DataArray type="Float32" NumberOfComponents="3" format="ascii">
         -2.567030301930377E+07 1.448508985971261E+08 -3.607762965630511E+03
         0 0 0
       </DataArray>
     </Points>
     <Cells>
       <DataArray Name="connectivity" type="Int32" format="ascii">0 1</DataArray>
       <DataArray Name="offsets" type="Int32" format="ascii">1 2</DataArray>
       <DataArray Name="types" type="UInt8" format="ascii">1 1</DataArray>
     </Cells>
   </Piece>
 </UnstructuredGrid>
</VTKFile>

The idea of this approach was to list all of the scalars and vectors for each corresponding body in a single file.  In this example the first listed scalar, vector, or coordinate point, is the Earth while the second set of values indicates the Sun's data.  By combining the bodies into a single file I could reduce the 500,000 files required down to some 60,000 files....still undesirable but better.

However I would also like to segment the Points once inside the ParaView environment; so I can create a distinct pipeline for each body in the dataset.  One application for this would be to allow different Glyph rendering rules for the Sun and the Earth so I can make the Sun...have a Sun texture - and the Earth an Earth texture.

After experimenting with this for awhile I found myself trying to implement a Programmable Filter.  The filter would take the Unstructured Grid for the given timestep, and given an index, extract the Point, Scalar, and Vector data from its input - then set only those values to the Output Unstructured Grid.  I currently have a script that looks something like this:

# CELLID 0 = EARTH
cellId = 0

# Obtain References To Input/Output Data
gridI = self.GetUnstructuredGridInput()
gridO = self.GetUnstructuredGridOutput()
dataI = self.GetInput()
dataO = self.GetOutput()
scalarI = dataI.GetPointData().GetScalars()
vectorI = dataI.GetPointData().GetVectors()

# Initialize Local Storage Arrays
newVector = vtk.vtkFloatArray()
newVector.SetName(vectorI.GetName())
newVector.SetNumberOfComponents(3)
newScalar = vtk.vtkFloatArray()
newScalar.SetName(scalarI.GetName())
newPoint = vtk.vtkPoints()
newPoint.SetNumberOfPoints(1)
newCell = vtk.vtkCellArray()

# Lookup CellId References
idCell = gridI.GetCell(cellId)
idCellType = gridI.GetCellType(cellId)
idPoint = gridI.GetPoints().GetPoint(cellId)
idScalar = scalarI.GetTuple(cellId)
idVector = vectorI.GetTuple(cellId)

# Populate New Local Cell Array with CellId Cell
newCell.InsertNextCell(idCell)

# Populate New Local Point Array With CellId Point
newPoint.SetPoint(0, idPoint)

# Populate New Local Scalars with CellId Scalar Tuples
newScalar.InsertNextTuple(idScalar)

# Populate New Local Vectors with CellID Vector Tuples
newVector.InsertNextTuple(idVector)

# Copy Local Cells, Scalars, Vectors, and Points Into Output Pipeline Data
gridO.SetPoints(newPoint)
gridO.SetCells(idCellType, newCell)
dataO.GetPointData().SetScalars(newScalar)
dataO.GetPointData().SetVectors(newVector)

The filter does achieve the desired effect for the cellID 0 - but when I switch the value of cellID to 1 (which should refer to the Sun's index) ParaView crashes hard - where I assume I am missing something, possibly requesting something out of bounds in memory.

I've been struggling with this problem for a little while now and thought to share my progress here; hopefully there is somebody out there with a little more insight that could help guide me towards either a conclusion with this implementation or a suggestion for a better approach.

Essentially - How can one give ParaView Point and Velocity vectors over a vast sequence of time without creating potentially hundreds of thousands of files on disc?  Does this Programmable Filter seem like a reasonable approach?  Is there a native feature I am missing that does this already?  Is there some other file format other than VTK I could use to have ParaView understand this format of data?

Any thoughts, comments, or questions will be greatly appreciated.  :)

Thanks,
    John

Hi,

What formatting should be used when adding documentation in the server

it is working in the latest version as it all appears in one paragraph (see
calculator documentation).  Is this a bug or has it always been like that?

Dear Paraview Users,

I am plotting contour and finding the maximum value of a variable. I am

When I animate it, contour animation works but the maximum value of the

Can anyone please shed some light over this? Or how to show the maximum

Dear Paraview users,

I want to use Paraview to make nice movies. One thing I want to do is to 
use "interpolate camera location" to zoom my object in and out. But it 
seems don't do what it should do. I tried to define camera position in 
x,y,z coordinates but these have no effect.  No matter what values or 
combination of values of x,y,z the object remains the same. It does not 
go away or come near.

Does any one know about this or has a script to do this? Any hint is 
more than welcome!

Thanks!

Hi Lorenzo!

Maybe you'd better off with reading the OpenFOAM solution with the built-in OpenFOAM reader. Just create in your case directory an empty OF.foam file and you can start reading the solution by opening this file from the GUI.

Hope this helps.

Frank.

You can also record either a trace or a state file in paraview where
you load a couple of files, then edit that recorded file in a text
editor and add in the additional files. Of the two, the trace file,
being a python script, is easier to edit and programmatically extend.

Subject: [Paraview] build error with boost and additional questions
Message-ID: <C8D9CB1A-E3F8-4FCF-9735-7B1FCA4BFB50@sdsc.edu>

Hello,

I have tried building Paraview3.14 with boost_1_49_0 and boost_1_47_0 versions.
I get the following error, is there a fix or workaround besides disabling boost altogether.
Please see ERROR below

Since I am doing this build for general purpose use on one of the big cluster what are canonical 
plugins which should be built? I am using the options as listed at the end of the message

Burlen mentioned sometime back that in the new version of Paraview the client and server will not require same plugins on both ends. Is this now possible?

Please also point me to documentation on how to create a Paraview profile for end users to easily use it remotely with client-server interface

Thanks
--Amit

There is already a bug report for this:

http://www.vtk.org/Bug/bug_relationship_graph.php?bug_id=12988&graph=dependency

I believe that boost_1_49_0 won't work, Can you try earlier versions?

Yes, I found the bug report by a web search as well.
I tried boost_1_47_0 with same error
Since the build take quite some time, I would like to know if there is a known version of boost which works Paraview3.14

Hi,

The ParaView Binary page ( http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView_Binaries )

Hi,

paraview 3.14 in Debian builds fine on all supported architectures
against boost 1.48

In 3.8 I think it was buried under tools->python shell.

I've tied that, thank you.

Now, my questions are:
1. once I've saved a trace, how I run it in paraview?
2. I see the trace keeps the files path. There's no way to include these file paths within a dot_something file in the same sintax in such a way that I'll load that file in paraview and it'll automatically load all the referenced files?

For example this file would contain something like:

geometry_1_vtk = LegacyVTKReader( FileNames=['path/to/my/file/geometry_1.vtk'] )
geometry_2_vtk = LegacyVTKReader( FileNames=['path/to/my/file/geometry_2.vtk'] )
geometry_3_vtk = LegacyVTKReader( FileNames=['path/to/my/file/geometry_3.vtk'] )
geometry_4_vtk = LegacyVTKReader( FileNames=['path/to/my/file/geometry_4.vtk'] )
?
geometry_N_vtk = LegacyVTKReader( FileNames=['path/to/my/file/geometry_5.vtk'] )

Thank you!

What format data are you using? If there isn't a parallel reader it could
be loading a separate copy on each process.

Also, how different are the results?

Subject: [Paraview] Oilflow - Surface flow
Message-ID: <16DEBCC7-8BE6-48BA-849C-A5E7893AACB7@gmail.com>

Hello all;
any way to have an oilflow visualization in paraview? Something like this:

http://www.cradle-cfd.com/product/post_image/oilflow_car.jpg

I have already read this one:
http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Custom_Filters

But this is a little bit  different problem since I do not have any velocity on the body surface?


Thank you!

Just a comment: if you do not know what reader type to create, you can
also use OpenDataFile(<filename>) function provided by the
paraview.simple module.

It has always been like that. We need to add support for formatting. I
remember thinking about it some, but I can't remember if I implemented
it or it still remains to be implemented -- the latter is more likely.

Subject: [Paraview] Writer plugin C++ code example
Message-ID: <4F6ECCAA.9050406@gmail.com>

Hi,

     I checked out from the git repository of paraview and build with 
PARAVIEW_INSTALL_DEVELOPMENT=ON

     While looking at the plugins directory

<some-path>/Paraview_git/Examples/Plugins/Writer

     I can see the directory contains the XML files for writer plugin 
but no C++ code to illustrate how one should write the plugins in C++

     On closer examination, the CMakeLists talks about building "reader"

     My interest is to write geometry information out for rendering 
using and external software e.g. RenderMan.

     Any pointers or URL I can start looking at ?

Regards

Message-ID: <83FB51056FB3664CB2A09728F5E9187701A65D85@email.ktk.uni-leipzig.de>

I try to compile one of the example plugins (GUIView) and get the
following error when executing CMake (2.8.6)

 

CMake Error at C:/ParaView-3.14.0/bin/VTK/ParaViewTargets.cmake:16

add_executable cannot create imported target "vtkEncodeString" because

another target with the same name already exists.

I build Paraview (3.14.0) and QT with VS2005 successfully. I have
another Paraview binary (3.14.0) installed on the same machine but no
separate VTK sources.

 

Any idea what is going on?

I've had this problem too. Seems that if you forget to turn on shared libs when you build paraview, then the find_package stuff for paraview causes these odd errors when you try to build plugins. Try turning on shared libs if you didn't already have it enabled. If it was already, then disregard this email.

Turning on shared libs solved the problem for CMake. However, when I compile ParaView I get an error related to xdmf.dll which is not built because of external  linker problem:

I've had this problem too. Seems that if you forget to turn on shared libs when you build paraview, then the find_package stuff for paraview causes these odd errors when you try to build plugins. Try turning on shared libs if you didn't already have it enabled. If it was already, then disregard this email.

Any idea what is going on?

might just be that libxml+xdmf didn't rebuild themselves when you turned on shared libs. Try wiping the build parts of those projects and rerunning cmake then build again.

Hi.

I'm considering to generate developed surface view on ParaView.
My VTK data contains cylindrical surfaces (defined on theta-z spaces),
and I want to convert them to flat planes (defined on x-y planes).
One idea is re-writing VTK file, but it's pretty troublesome.
Are there any ideas to do it easily?

Hi,

is there an easy way to customize the filter toolbar? For example, the "Plot selection over time" I filter is the one I use all the time. I would like to have a button on the toolbar, like there are buttons for the calculator, contour plot, clip, ...

How do I do it?

Thanks,

Matthias

Tools->Python Shell->Run Script

Better still, if you choose to save the trace as a macro (or just put
it into ~/.config/ParaVIew/Macros), it shows up in the macros toolbar
and you can just click to run it again.

> 2. I see the trace keeps the files path. There's no way to include these file paths within a dot_something file in the same sintax in such a way that I'll load that file in paraview and it'll automatically load all the referenced files?

The trace is just a python script. def a function that will read the
filename string, strip out the leading directory information, and
produce and loop over a list of the rest of the filenames from that.

Unfortunately python isn't tightly integrated enough yet to
automatically call your macro from the File->Open dialog.

You can record a trace in which you just apply that filter, and then
save the trace as a macro.  It won't be in the common filters toolbar,
but it will be in the macros toolbar which is by default right next to
it.

If you are building from source you can add the filter to the Common
group in Applications/ParaView/ParaViewFilters.xml.

You could also write a plugin that does it.

Hi David,

thank you for the hints. Unfortunately it doesn't work for me that way. The macro I get is

---------------------------------
try: paraview.simple
except: from paraview.simple import *
paraview.simple._DisableFirstRenderCameraReset()

my_file_pvd = GetActiveSource()
PlotSelectionOverTime8 = PlotSelectionOverTime()

Render()
----------------------------

I must admit that I don't know Python at all. It's not the same language as in "Life of Brian"...  ;-))
I have had a look in the ParaView Manual which did not enlighten me for this specific problem.
When I execute the macro above, ParaView creates a Plot SelectionOverTime object, but when I hit "Apply", nothing happens. Also it seems to me that the Macro expects a specific name for the dataset. How can I generalize it, once it works?

Thanks for some more hints...

Matthias

The 2004 edition described ParaView 2.x. The 2007 edition described
ParaView 3.x.

Either would be fine to cite.

Thank you David;

I think I also found something:
http://www.cfd-online.com/Forums/openfoam-post-processing/94538-separate-vtk-files-openfoam-fields-synchronous-time.html#post332912
http://www.cacr.caltech.edu/~slombey/asci/vtk/

I think in the latter it says that you may link many vtp files within an amr or pvd file. Would that work as I would? I mean: I would create this file with the paths in it using a simple script and then I could load this file in paraview to have everything at once? I only need to know whether that may work with .vtp only files or with vtk files as well. In case it would only work with vtk files, is there any way to convert them from vtk to vtp?

Thank you all again for your time!

Lorenzo

pvd files can not point to the older style vtk files, they can only
point to the newer xml based vt? (vtu/vtp/vti etc) files.

A script to convert between them build a two element pipeline
consisting of a vtkDataSetReader connected to a vtkXMLPolyDataWriter.
Set the FileNames on both and call Write() on the writer to make the
converted
file.

Subject: [Paraview] camera animation Paraview doesn't work
Message-ID: <4F709066.3030809@knmi.nl>

Dear Paraview users,

I'm using Paraview.3.14. What I tried is to use "camera path" or 
Interpolate camera locations" to zoom in or out of the object. But so 
far it is only possible to rotate the object. No matter what values the 
"camera position" gets the object doesn't goes away or near from the view.

I saw some people had the same problem before, but haven't seen any 
answer to this. Has anyone a solution to this?

Thanks in advance!
Xueli

I missed that you were using a selection related filter.

You could record the action of making the selection too in that case.
But that is problematic because you don't have as much control over
what to plot.

Otherwise, for when you make the selection manually and then apply the
macro you've already got, it seems that ParaView isn't creating the
plot view for you like it normally does for some reason. To work
around, open up a line chart view and then replay your trace. Select
the plot view and then click the eye icon in the pipeline browser next
to the plot filter to show the result.

Hi David,

thank you for your answer.
The procedure you proposed did not work for me - clicking on the eye has no effect. What does work is the following:

1. Create selection manually
2. Play trace
3. Click on "Apply"
4. Open a new view
5. Check "Display"-> "Visible"

However, selecting the PlotSelectionOverTime filter from the menu and clicking "Apply" makes the plot appear in two steps. I was thinking that a PlotSelectionOverTime button could save me two clicks, as I often have to process many datasets in a row.  But it seems that the two clicks saved here have to be done elsewhere for making the plot appear...

I should perhaps think about learning how to program a  macro in order to automate the whole thing - the procedure I do all  the time is:

1. Open the dataset
2. Change the displayed variable, edit the color map
3. Select a point (always the same)
4. Plot selection over time
5. Save data in a csv file

Steps 2 and 3 are optional - I think steps 1,4,5 must be easy to do automatically if I know how... ;)
Is there a good starting point, a tutorial or something for macro programming apart from the ParaView Manual?

Thank you for your help,

Matthias

Message-ID: <F9562F3B302F29479A203FC5AF9E3E0506FB43@SERBE4I1.intra.erbe-med.de>

Hi,

since ParaView 3.14, the plot window seems to be split horizontally by default when a new plot is generated, e.g. by the PlotSelectionOverTime filter. In ParaView 3.12, it was split vertically, which I prefer. Can this be set somewhere in the preferences or in the initialization file?

Thank you,

Matthias

Hi again,

I have succeeded making a trace which essentially does what I want, i.e. automatically performing steps from my message 1,4,5 below.

Thanks,

Matthias

But it has changed from 3.12 to 3.14 - was this on purpose, or is it a "feature"? ;)

The purpose was that random swicthing of which direction to split
causes failures in the testing framework which led to unreliable test
playback.

In ParaView 3.12 an earlier, the split was determined by the aspect ratio
of the view.  If the view was taller than wide, it split vertically by
default.  If the view was wider than tall, it split horizontally by
default.  It now seems to always split horizontally.  Why the change?

Thank you, Ken.

I tried Calculation filter and got a good result!
I used acos() function, so I couldn't extract whole cylindrical surface.
But fortunately, my source data is quarter or half one.
So it wasn't a problem for me.

At first, I thought the Calculator just as a calculating tool
with Scalar or Vector values.
But on your advice, I believed that is one of the typical
post-processing tool of ParaView.

Rob and Aashish: Ok so boost 1.45.0 worked fine with Paraview 3.14

Can someone confirm that Paraview client and server (remote) do not require same sets of plugin on either end.
Is there a required minimal plugin set?

Thanks

The ParaView Binary page ( http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView_Binaries ) which version of each library ParaView is built against. ParaView 3.14 used Boost 1.45.0.

Hello,

I have tried building Paraview3.14 with boost_1_49_0 and boost_1_47_0 versions.
I get the following error, is there a fix or workaround besides disabling boost altogether.
Please see ERROR below

Since I am doing this build for general purpose use on one of the big cluster what are canonical
plugins which should be built? I am using the options as listed at the end of the message

Burlen mentioned sometime back that in the new version of Paraview the client and server will not require same plugins on both ends. Is this now possible?

Please also point me to documentation on how to create a Paraview profile for end users to easily use it remotely with client-server interface

Thanks

All plugins are indeed optional. If you build your server statically,
it will include all plugins that were enabled at build time so you may
get a warning message when a client connects to the server to load the
missing plugins on the client as well, at which point they can be
loaded on cleint.

Mostly testing. As panels size started changing on different
platforms, it was not uncommon to end up with the views being split
differently during different runs.

Hey, Amit,

FWIW, I know that in the past (pv3.10 and pv3.12) I have run into issues when client/server plugins don't match.  This was a problem when using a binary distribution of the client, which included many (all?) of the reader plugins, against a pvserver that I built which did not include the same reader plugins.  
Specifically, it failed if I tried to open a file for which there was not a default choice of reader.  If I understand correctly, the client would go down the list of readers that it knew about, and tell the server to try it.  But if the server did not know about that reader, it would case ParaView to fail.

I believe this has been addressed in PV3.14, but I have not had a chance to confirm.

joe.

Subject: [Paraview]  Ask to save state changes before quiting?
Message-ID: <CA+8Z1Whe5S2N=paUuTaDLNkspdbFOpyX7qCD5ynM2r-VKEP6sg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,
is it possible to configure Paraview to ask to save changes, when, for
example, I accidentally close it?
Let's say I am using it, then I saved a state, I closed it, then I oppened
it, reloaded the state, did something new, and accidentally close it again.
I want to save the new state, but paraview just closes. Is there any
configuration option I am missing?
INFO:
paraview 3.14
SNow Leopard 10.6.8
Thanks in advance

Best regards / Cordialmente,

Message-ID: <83FB51056FB3664CB2A09728F5E9187701A65E6E@email.ktk.uni-leipzig.de>

Dear All

 

I would like to make the vtkImageMarchingCubes filter visible in
ParaView. However I struggle when writing the GUI XML-File implementing
the SetValue() parameter. I didn't find an example of an XML-File
showing the syntax of a composed command: SetValue(int i, double value).

 

  <DoubleVectorProperty

         name="Value"

         label="Value for Isosurface"

         command="SetValue"

         number_of_elements="1"

         animateable="1"

         default_values="1500.5" >

  </DoubleVectorProperty>

 

 

Any help would be highly appreciated. 

 

Peter.

Hi Utkarsh,

If we don't explicitly enable the bridge on the server side, and user is 
making use of client from the KW binaries, will it crash if a file type 
associated to the bridge is opened?

do you think that the PV binaries c/should be built with the default 
build options, to reduce incompatibilities? but also maybe to improve 
the cmake coverage?

No it won't, starting 3.14. With 3.14 the client fetches the list of
available proxies from the server, so if the server doesn't have the
VisIt bridge enabled, the readers simply won't be available for the
client.

Not sure what you mean exactly. Are you saying the default cmake
values should be the ones that we use to build PV binaries? I think
the superbuild proposal will address this issue. Using the superbuild
it would be easier to build binaries using similar settings.

You need something list this:

 <DoubleVectorProperty
	name="ContourValues"
	command="SetValue"
	repeat_command="1"
	set_number_command="SetNumberOfContours"
	number_of_elements_per_command="1"
	use_index="1"
	label="Slice Offset Values">

The key attributes you're missing are repeat_command,
set_number_command,  and use_index.

Unfortunately that doesn't work for me. I do not get a window where I could enter my contour value. Is there a documentation available regarding the XML syntax used for ParaView plugins? So I could look it up.

Thanks - Peter

You need something list this:

 <DoubleVectorProperty
	name="ContourValues"
	command="SetValue"
	repeat_command="1"
	set_number_command="SetNumberOfContours"
	number_of_elements_per_command="1"
	use_index="1"
	label="Slice Offset Values">

The key attributes you're missing are repeat_command, set_number_command,  and use_index.

My server side Paraview build was built without visit bridge. 
On client side I used binaries for OS X 64 bit
I established a cs session and when I tired to open a .bov file both client and server crashed.
Utkarsh this behaviour seems buggy as per your explanation.

Doh! That sounds like a bug to me. Let me track that down. Maybe we
can fix it in time for 3.14.1.

Amit, you may want to enable the visit bridge as it dramatically expands 
the number of file formats pv can open, and would very likely work 
around the bug you found.

I agree having visit bridge will be useful. I just finished building silo and cgns to go along with it. I am about to fire a fresh build right now.

I try to implement setvalue(int i, double value) in xml for GUI interacting in a pv plugin were the user can set value with i set to 0. Is there any example available on the net?

Thank you - Peter

Hi Utkarsh.

It seems that you were right: the problem is on my side, due to the 
settings of my graphic card NVIDIA Quadro FX 1800 on Linux CentOS.

As Paraview does not allow to set Antialiasing on, I had set 
Antialiasing through the control panel of my NVIDIA graphic card and I 
had selected the "Override Application Settings" option.

But these settings are not taken into account each time I start the PC: 
starting Paraview without opening the NVIDIA control panel before always 
gives images without antialiasing (PV 312 or PV 314), and PV 314 shows 
these unexpected lines in "Surface with edges" view mode.

But if I open the NVIDIA control panel before starting Paraview, look at 
the Antialiasing setting that is always "Override Application Settings" 
and quit the control panel without changing anything, Paraview 312 or 
314 gives now clean images with antialiasing... and PV 314 does not show 
the unexpected lines in "Surface with edges" view mode ! Very strange !

Best regards.

Richard.

That sounds like a great feature request. Would you please add it to
the bug tracker?
http://paraview.org/Bug/login_page.php

Note: this is similar to the crash recovery preference/setting, which
is not quite what you are looking for and is heavier weight than what
is needed in this case.

Subject: [Paraview] Oilflow - Surface flow
Message-ID: <4F730AEA.4040202@onera.fr>

Hello.

For an oilflow visualisation you should use the "Surface LIC" view mode.

First, you have to load this plugin at first start of Paraview: menu 
"Tools -> Manage plugins", select the "SurfaceLIC" plugin, and press the 
"Load selected" button as on image 1. You may also want to select the + 
sign before the "SurfaceLIC" line to show its sub-options and select 
"Auto load". Then you will not have to load the plugin again each time 
you start Paraview.

Then you need to build a surface object having a vector variable. If you 
have only scalar components vx, vy, vz of the vector, use the Calculator 
Filter to build the vector from its components writing a formula such as 
vx*iHat+vy*jHat+vz*kHat.

Then select the SurfaceLIC representation as on image 2

You also may want to set some LIC parameters in the Display tab of the 
selected object such as the vector variable to be used or other parameters.

Richard.

Thank you Richard.

Maybe I'm missing something but I don't get anything?
Once I've built the vector as U_X*iHat+U_Y*jHat+U_Z*kHat with the calculator, what should I do? Also, as my velocity is 0 on the surface, I think this vector I built equals (0,0,0) everywhere? Isn't it?

Hi Lorenzo,

I assume you are using OpenFOAM based on your previous questions. The command 'wallGradU -latestTime' will give you the gradient of the velocity at the wall. This vector can then be used as input for the surfaceLIC representation to create oilflow like images. I am not sure if surfaceLIC works on all type of cells. In older versions of paraview I needed to convert my structured surface mesh to triangles first using the filter tetrahedralize.

Hello Lorenzo.

First, you should check that the "Result" vector that you built in the 
Calculator filter is the vector used by LIC: check it at the bottom of 
the Display tab of your Calculator object.

Second, your vector should not be the (0,0,0) vector ! Of course, if 
your scalars U_X, U_Y and U_Z are 0 everywhere, the "Result" Vector will 
be (0,0,0) everywhere and LIC will not work! LIC absolutely needs a 
vector that is not (0,0,0) ant that is different from the Normal vector !

Making an "oilflow" visualization if you don't have a non zero surface 
velocity vector or a non zero skin friction vector makes no sense. But 
you may get something that looks like an oilflow provided you use any 
vector that has a non zero projection on the surface. For instance, 
using several instances of the Calculator filter, you may construct each 
scalar component vx, vy, vz of the vector from formulas using the x,y,z 
coordinate, then build a "Result" vector from these non zero scalar 
components. But it will be better if you can provide data with some kind 
of surface velocity or friction vector.

Richard.

This is odd. I just tried the same with a server built without VisIt
bridge and a client with VisitBridge and tried to load a bov file and
ParaView nicely told me to pick the reader to use since it could not
decide which one to use.

Looks like I was using git-master and things are fine and peachy
there. I do get the error with 3.14.0 tag. We may just have to bite
the bullet and wait for the next major release for this fix. In
anycase, the next major release is just months away :).

 3.14 Linux 32 bits
Message-ID: <CA+8Z1Wgd_nFca5sQA8MkEO46q_KpUCCrEx2DDYGA4S02o6726Q@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,
a friend of mine is starting to use Paraview, but she is having the
following problem:
Everything works normally after she applies some  opacity : in that case,
she has some rendering problems. The sample file can be downloaded in
http://goo.gl/v0YD2 , is a techplot file (please read with the plain
techplot reader, not the ensight one), and an screenshot of the problem can
also be downloaded at http://goo.gl/U0pL1 (you can see there the stranges
diagonal "surfaces" at the corners)
The systems specs:
Linux Ubuntu 2.6.35-32-generic Version 10.10 32 bits
Paraview 3.14 bits
*The problem does not appear in the mac version of paraview 3.14.*
We though the problem could be related with the graphic card. She has a
nVidia Corporation G86 [GeForce 8500 GT] (rev a1), but she is using the
nouveau driver. She cannot install the nvidia propietary driver.
Any suggestion and advice is greatly welcome. Thanks in advance.

Thanks both of you, your help is really appreciated!

@ Richard: as I'm using the non slip condition for my walls geometry, the velocity on the surface is 0 everywhere? Just checked and the vector I get with the calculator is made by zeroes only? so, what is not clear to me, is how do I give the LIC a vector which is not zero?

@ Koen: that worked. Any way to reduce the number of oilflow paths?

Again, I would like to thank you two and everybody else in this mailing list for your help.

But you may get something that looks like an oilflow provided you use any vector that has a non zero projection on the surface. For instance, using several instances of the Calculator filter, you may construct each scalar component vx, vy, vz of the vector from formulas using the x,y,z coordinate, then build a "Result" vector from these non zero scalar components. But it will be better if you can provide data with some kind of surface velocity or friction vector.

Hi Lorenzo.

If your data are the results of a CFD computation, the surface velocity 
should be non zero when solving Euler equations with wall slip 
conditions, or zero everywhere when solving the Navier-Stokes equations 
with wall adherence conditions (non slip). But when solving 
Navier-Stokes equations, you should get a skin friction vector (local 
tangential force) that is non zero: for LIC to give an oilflow pattern, 
you should use this skin friction vector instead of the velocity vector.

And please, could you tell us what was the solution given by Koen? His 
mail was missing.

Richard.

Subject: [Paraview] problem when trying to display points using programmable
	filter
Message-ID: <4F743353.5070008@uclouvain.be>

Dear users,

I try to compute points, lines, axes using the programmable filter from 
5 points acquired by a PointSource.
I select the 5 pointsource, compute axis but paraview simply crashes 
when I InsertNextCell on the output.
This happens when I get several InputData using GetInputDataObject().
If I get only one input using GetPolyDataInput(), the line is well 
displayed. Is there a trick?

Thanks for your help,
Laurent.

Here is my code:

A = self.GetInputDataObject(0, 0)
B = self.GetInputDataObject(0, 1)
C = self.GetInputDataObject(0, 2)
D = self.GetInputDataObject(0, 3)
E = self.GetInputDataObject(0, 4)
Point1 = A.GetPoint(0)
print Point1
Point2 = B.GetPoint(0)
print Point2
Point3 = C.GetPoint(0)
print Point3
Point4 = D.GetPoint(0)
print Point4

newPts = vtk.vtkPoints()

#Do some computations (NewPoint1 and NewPoint2) and add it to the newPts
newPts.InsertPoint(0, NewPoint1)
newPts.InsertPoint(1, NewPoint2)

NewLine = vtk.vtkLine()
NewLine.GetPointIds().SetNumberOfIds(2)
NewLine.GetPointIds().SetId(0,0)
NewLine.GetPointIds().SetId(1,1)

output =  self.GetPolyDataOutput()
output.SetPoints(newPts)
# Crash here... don't know why
output.InsertNextCell(NewLine.GetCellType(), NewLine.GetPointIds())

Hi all;
I managed to calculate the wall shear stress in openFoam using the command
 wallShearStress -latestTime
and using the results (vector) as in input for the LIC!

That's great!

Now I'd have another question related to this topic:
as I see the LIC is pretty heavy in paraview even though mine is a small geometry. I'm wondering, once I've loaded the wall shear stress, I could use the stream tracer on it to get more or less what I want. The only problem I'm having is that the line that generates the streamlines needs to be exactly on the surface of my body. Is there any way to attach the line to the surface?

Thank you again!

Subject: [Paraview] Clip on Extract Subset crashes when Extract Subset
	reduces to a surface
Message-ID: <4F746469.2050302@onera.fr>

Hello, all.

Just to let you to know that the "Clip" filter applied on an "Extract 
Subset" object crashes when the "Extract Subset" reduces to a surface.

Here is an example tested on PV 314 :

- Loading a structured IJK domain (Tecplot reader or else), say Imax=40, 
Jmax=8 and Kmax=20

- Add the "Extract subset" filter to get the surface J=0, so subset 
indexes are I from 0 to Imax, J from 0 to 0, K from 0 to Kmax

- Add the "Clip" filter with plane Z=something => Crash !!!

Workaround: after the "Extract Subset" filter, add the "Extract 
Surfaces" filter, then the "Clip" filter and clipping is OK !

Bests regards.

Richard

Try clipping and otherwise subsetting the original geometry to make
the seeds and use that as the source in the "Stream Tracer with Custom

Hi Lorenzo.

The Stream Tracer works very well to follow a 3D streamline in a  
volume, but I always got bad results to follow streamlines on a curved 
surface. When you start from a point on a surface to follow a 
streamline, the next point is found with a small step in the direction 
of the tangent vector, but this new point is not on the surface if the 
surface is curved. So the new point should be projected onto the surface 
before proceeding to the next step. It seems that  the Streal Tracer 
algorithm does not project correctly the new point at each step, so you 
get only small pieces of streamlines, depending on the curvature of the 
surface. The more the surface is curved, the more the Stream Tracer has 
difficulties to remain on the surface when following the stream line. 
The Stream Tracer gives good results on a surface only if the surface is 
plane.

For me, the LIC plugin was a marvelous workaround for surface 
streamlines, and for two reasons. First, it gives quickly pretty 
pictures. Second, it gives at a glance the whole surface flow pattern, 
so you can easily identify complex separated flow regions without having 
to guess seed points as you would do with the the Stream Tracer. Now I 
am always using the Stream Tracer for 3D streamlines in a volume and the 
LIC plugin for surface flow patterns.

I don't understand why you say that LIC is "heavy" in Paraview ? Once 
you have a surface vector in your data, you have only to change the 
Representation from Surface to SurfaceLIC and the rendering is 
immediate, and I think faster than computing streamlines. The only 
drawback of LIC is that it depends on your graphic card, and it may not 
work depending on the version of your driver.

I think the surface vectors and surface flows filters are meant to
address this problem.

Thank you Richard.

The LIC seems heavy when you pan, zoom in or zoom out your geometry, not in generating the flow paths. What you get is actually really nice.

If there no way in getting good streamlines (as you pointed out I got short lines only) then the LIC is fine.

Maybe there's a way of generating that directly in openfoam, as there is for free flow streamlines.

Thank you again for your time.

Lorenzo

Subject: [Paraview] another question about polydata
Message-ID: <4F746EDD.9080405@uclouvain.be>

Re-Hi!

I'm a bit lost with my programmable filter...
I have a PolyData as input, I want to compute points (it's ok, I've got 
their coordinates) and display only the points.
I've tried using vtkCellArray as vertices and lines.
When I add the new points to the array, the output contains the input 
PolyData plus points that are not related to the computed ones.
I understand that the input is automatically added to the output? When I 
do 'verts.InsertCellPoint(k)' in my for loop, I don't add my new points 
but the first ones from the input!
How can I specify the coordinates of MY points?
I don't find any method to add specific points.

Is there a way to easily put new points into the output and display them?

I think I miss something with input/output and managing the 
cells/lines/verts.
Thanks!
Laurent.

Lorenzo.

There is a LIC parameter that is responsible of the "heavy" feature when 
you pan, rotate, zoom, etc..

Look at the bottom of the "Display" tab of your object that use LIC: you 
will see the option "Use LIC when using LOD". This option is checked by 
default and makes LIC to recompute the rendering while your are moving 
the object.

Uncheck this option: LIC will be deactivated while you are changing the 
view and it will render the object only when you will release the mouse 
button. It may take a while before rendering occurs after mouse button 
release depending on a parameter in the settings: menu "Edit->Settings", 
select "Render View" and look at the value of the "Lock interactive 
render" parameter: it should be 2 (seconds) by default and you may set 
it to zero.

@David:
> I think the surface vectors and surface flows filters are meant to

I have tested these filters together with the "Stream tracer with Custom 
source" filter, but I never succeeded in getting full streamlines on the 
curved surface of an aircraft. I think there is really a problem of 
projection in the Stream Tracer algorithm. I wonder if this projection 
is done as it is only a second order modification of the vector 
direction and it is not needed to follow a stream line in volume.

Best way I've found so far for oilflows is to:

(1) Select surface and run mask points (random, say 100 points)
(2) Use the stream tracer with custom source (being the mask points filter)

That should give some good answers. ParaView does need a form of
snap-to-surface spline to overcome the issue Lorenzo had.

I think the surface vectors and surface flows filters are meant to address

Thank you anybody once again. I'm very pleased to see you can get so many tips here and that there are so many people from the industry.

From what I've seen so far the LIC seems the best way. I tried do uncheck the  "Use LIC when using LOD" option as per Richard suggestion but it doesn't seem to have sorted any effect? actually, it doesn't seem to work at all on a mac and it also caused paraview to crash?

About the stream tracer with custom source, I tried that but the result is quite ugly (even though you can see some flow characteristics).

I think for now I'll stick to the LIC.

Thank you all again!

Subject: [Paraview] PluginFilter based on vtkPolyDataAlgorithm with two
	different types of input data
Message-ID: <83FB51056FB3664CB2A09728F5E9187701A65EF4@email.ktk.uni-leipzig.de>

I try to implement a vtkPolyDataAlgorithm filter as plugin in PV. The filter has 2 inputs: (1) vtkPolyData and (2) vtkImageData. Within the xml-file the different data types are declared:

 

  <InputProperty

         name="3DModel"

                port_index="0"

         command="SetInputConnection">

        <ProxyGroupDomain name="groups">

          <Group name="sources"/>

          <Group name="filters"/>

        </ProxyGroupDomain>

        <DataTypeDomain name="input_type">

          <DataType value="vtkPolyData"/>

        </DataTypeDomain>

        </InputProperty>

      <InputProperty

         name="3DVolume"

                port_index="1"

         command="SetInputConnection">

        <ProxyGroupDomain name="groups">

          <Group name="sources"/>

          <Group name="filters"/>

        </ProxyGroupDomain>

        <DataTypeDomain name="input_type">

          <DataType value="vtkImageData"/>

        </DataTypeDomain>

     </InputProperty>

 

The code compiles without error and the plugin can be loaded into PV. But when I select the plugin in PV the following error occurs:

 

 

ERROR: In ..\..\..\VTK\Filtering\vtkDemandDrivenPipeline.cxx, line 827

vtkPVCompositeDataPipeline (1FBD9388): Input for connection index 0 on input port index 1 for algorithm vtkCTOAM(1F9E8D80) is of type vtkImageData, but a vtkPolyData is required.

ERROR: In ..\..\..\VTK\Filtering\vtkDemandDrivenPipeline.cxx, line 827

vtkPVCompositeDataPipeline (1FBD9388): Input for connection index 0 on input port index 1 for algorithm vtkCTOAM(1F9E8D80) is of type vtkImageData, but a vtkPolyData is required.

vtkPVCompositeDataPipeline (1FBD9388): Input for connection index 0 on input port index 1 for algorithm vtkCTOAM(1F9E8D80) is of type vtkImageData, but a vtkPolyData is required.

 

Obviously, the plugin does only accept polydata as input, because it is based on a vtkPolyDataAlgorithm filter. Is there a way I could mix both data types as input to a vtkPolyDataAlgorithm?

Subject: [Paraview] Modeling a earth sphere
Message-ID: <4F74C175.1040003@gmail.com>

Good afternoon,
    I am new to working with paraview and heard about the group mailing 
list, so I hope I stumbled into the right place.  I am in need of some 
hopeful reliable references or advice that anyone can give so thank you 
in advance.

I am currently working on a project that will visualize current 
satellite trajectory around the earth using data obtained from a novatel 
OEM4 GPS receiver.  I thought it would be pretty neat if I could 
actually have a representation of earth as opposed to just creating a 
'sphere' to use as the body of mass for the satellites.

As opposed to tools like matlab that there are function calls, I am 
unsure that paraview has such a feature.  As primitive a request as this 
may seem, what if any, resources have people used to make model earth? 
Are you able to use textures on your model as well using paraview?

As a side note,
  Hopeful continuation of this project beyond my course, I was also told 
that there is a beta version of a real-time paraview in the works that 
would ideally take-in realtime data for visualization.  Can anyone 
elaborate on this a bit more?

Thank you in advance,

~Julian

You may find it useful to checkout this link:

http://www.earthmodels.org/data-and-tools/topography/paraview-topography-by-texture-mapping

There, you can download a unit sphere with texture coordinates:

http://www.earthmodels.org/data-and-tools/topography/unitsphere_5deg_open_surfacenormals.vtp

That page has some textures for download, here is another one:

Just implement the FillInputPortInformation and return the right type for the port requested.

Message-ID: <4F75614E.5010904@gmail.com>

Hi,

     I have been looking at the Animation feature in Paraview.

http://www.itk.org/Wiki/ParaView/Users_Guide/Animation

     Is there information on how the built-in POV exporter can be 
connected to the animation feature in Paraview so that it export out a 
series of frames (*.pov files) for rendering ?

Subject: [Paraview] Access on widget properties
Message-ID: <004501cd0e78$988611c0$c9923540$@tu-cottbus.de>

Hello,

I want to have access on the "HandlePositions" property of a spline widget
(proxygroup="3d_widget_representations" proxyname="SplineRepresentation").
So I tried to search proxies and its properties via vtkSMProxyManager which
is similar to the way of the VR-Plugin. 

To try this approach I've create a new scene with a single Spline widget and
saved the state file. The widget representation is named as
"DataRepresentation1". I thought I can now have access on certain properties
- let's say "HandlePositions" - and change the values as I desire.
Unfortunately, this does not work:  

vtkSMProxy* Proxy = 
       vtkSMProxyManager::GetProxyManager()->
            GetActiveSessionProxyManager()->
            GetProxy( " DataRepresentation1" );

if(Proxy)
  {
  vtkSMDoubleVectorProperty* Property =
           vtkSMDoubleVectorProperty::SafeDownCast( 
              Proxy->GetProperty( " HandlePositions " ));	
  }

The property would be NULL.

Can someone help me please?

Thanks.

Please file a feature request. I can see how linking the scene
exporters into animation the way image writers are would be useful.
Note, there is probably a way to do it through the python interface,
but I'ld have to dig for it.

Subject: [Paraview] Difficult issue building paraview 3.14.0 on build farm
Message-ID: <5F6E96B2-9ECA-4C47-9EA6-CBD8CB5D40B1@llnl.gov>

Hello, Paraview build experts!  Please help me, I'm in over my head now, I think.  

I am trying to build Paraview 3.14 with OS Mesa for our clusters.  It's getting weird.  
I can build on the cluster using a shell script and it works fine.  But when using the same machine to make a dpkg it fails.  I cannot tell the difference between what works and what doesn't.  
The only clue is that during the cmake process, I see this for the bad build and not for the good, and it seems related.   

-- Looking for Q_WS_X11
-- Looking for Q_WS_X11 - found
-- Looking for Q_WS_WIN
-- Looking for Q_WS_WIN - not found.
-- Looking for Q_WS_QWS
-- Looking for Q_WS_QWS - not found.
-- Looking for Q_WS_MAC
-- Looking for Q_WS_MAC - not found.


The error I'm getting is building QVTKWidget.cxx, which does not even get built during the good build.

Glad you got it working.

One thing I can suggest is that you put all of you -Dargs into an
initial cmakecache.txt for safekeeping. Then put that into a clean
build directory and simply run cmake . on it to generate the build
environment without prompts as you prefer.

For example:
[havnor:ParaView/release/ParaView] demarle% cat
/Builds/ParaView/release/CMakeCache.txt.superbuild
BUILD_TESTING:BOOL=OFF
CMAKE_HOME_DIRECTORY:INTERNAL=/Source/ParaView/release/ParaView/SuperBuild
ParaView_BUILD_DOCUMENTATION:BOOL=ON
CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Release
CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES:STRING=x86_64
CMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET:STRING=10.5
CMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT:PATH=/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.5.sdk
QT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE:FILEPATH=/ThirdPartyLibraries/Qt/4.6.4/install64/bin/qmake
PYTHON_EXECUTABLE:FILEPATH=/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.5/bin/python
PYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR:FILEPATH=/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.5/include/python2.5
PYTHON_LIBRARY:PATH=/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.5/Python
PYTHON_INCLUDE_PATH:INTERNAL=/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.5/include/python2.5

[havnor:ParaView/release/ParaView] demarle% mkdir
/Builds/ParaView/release/PV3.14.1
[havnor:ParaView/release/ParaView] demarle% cd /Builds/ParaView/release/PV3.14.1
[havnor:ParaView/release/PV3.14.1] demarle% cp
../CMakeCache.txt.superbuild CMakeCache.txt
[havnor:ParaView/release/PV3.14.1] demarle% cmake .
[havnor:ParaView/release/PV3.14.1] demarle% make -j 8

Subject: [Paraview] Problem with Contour filter
Message-ID: <CAE_bc5ZPwtwTpN9_efwTnhnLV2BFj-wxCzrR6ZN6RdASG59iAQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am applying the Contour filter on a 3D dataset of *.VTR type with
non-uniform grid in all three directions.
I am expecting the iso-surface of vorticity magnitude of, say, 5.
The precision is FLOAT (I have tried DOUBLE as well and did not see any
difference).
The question is:
Why do I see some strange behavior at some parts of the surface. For
instance, the iso-surface is suddenly stopped and ends with wiggles and
ratchets on its boundaries?
Attached, you can see what is exactly happening.
The correct behavior is captured by the same filter in one half of the
domain, and not the other side.
Anyone has experienced similar problems before?
(I am using PV 3.14 on an Ubuntu machine. )

Cheers,
Mohamad M. Nasr-Azadani

Thanks, but I'm doing the build from a shell script, and the arguments are stored in the shell script that does the build.  So I'm not just reinventing the wheel each time.
