Subject: [Paraview] Integrate Variables
Message-ID: <CAEOCX7dPptiNBmtcaHnnjVtK3yHf0vvZnnoQk=pOKdm5at_R+Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I have a function for mass flowrate that I want to plot over a time period
DT. The velocity is time averaged per timestep dt, not the whole time
period, DT. In otherwords the number of timesteps is DT/dt.

mdot(T) = int_A (rho . u(T) . n . alpha(T)) dA

mdot(T) is the massflow rate over time (kg/s)
int_A () dA is the integral over the area of a slice through the domain
(m^2)
rho is the density of the particle phase and this is constant (kg/m^3)
u(T) is the time averaged velocity of the particle phase for a timestep of
dt and varies with time, T (m/s)
n is the unit vector normal to the area (-)
alpha is the time averaged volume fraction of the particle phase and also
varies with time T (-)

I think I am pretty sure that I can compute rho . u . n . alpha

My process in paraview:

Slice > Origin = 0, 0, 0, Normal = 0, 1, 0, Slice Type = Plane

This is the part in the brackets of the massflow rate equation. Mean just
means time averaged:

Calculator > abs(U1Mean_Y)*2900*alpha1Mean

Now I must integrate this over the area of the slice.

*** Is it correct to use the Filter > IntegrateVariables? ***

I then use PlotSelectionOverTime (which I'm pretty sure is right).

Kind regards,

Andrew

Ah, I assumed your data was on a regular grid. I've modified the
example to set up a vtkPolyData instead to hold an unstructured set of
points. I have also shown how to add multiple arrays to the data set.
Just treat each scalar column you have as an array.

#### import the simple module from the paraview
from paraview.simple import *
#### disable automatic camera reset on 'Show'
paraview.simple._DisableFirstRenderCameraReset()

# Create a 2D image data object
from paraview import vtk
vtk_poly_data = vtk.vtkPolyData()
points = vtk.vtkPoints()
points.SetNumberOfPoints(200)
vtk_poly_data.SetPoints(points)

# Wrap data in numpy interface
from vtk.numpy_interface import dataset_adapter as dsa
poly_data = dsa.WrapDataObject(vtk_poly_data)

# Create numpy array. Set your data here
import numpy as np
x_coords = np.zeros(200) # zeros is just a stand-in for your actual data
y_coords = np.ones(200)
z_coords = np.zeros(200)

poly_data.Points[:,0] = x_coords
poly_data.Points[:,1] = y_coords
poly_data.Points[:,2] = z_coords

# Set the data in the image object
scalar1 = np.random.rand(200)
poly_data.PointData.append(scalar1, 'scalar1')
scalar2 = np.random.rand(200)
poly_data.PointData.append(scalar2, 'scalar2')

# Now set up a ParaView proxy for the image data
tp = PVTrivialProducer()
tp.GetClientSideObject().SetOutput(vtk_poly_data)
Show(tp)


# Set up filters, display options, etc. below

No, there is no ParaView-provided way to do that. Maybe there is some
other way you can do that with a different Python module. Note,
though, that ParaView does not provide a Python module manager a la
pip, so consider doing that experimental.

Subject: [Paraview] wrong 'Coloring' in Contour with large datapoints
Message-ID: <CAJs4fygZi+agZWTAN7t5jCJRskir2QP9RdDPZA102kKvrzAa+g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have two scalar fields, Q and cosalpha, and they are both 768 x 768 x
12288 big.

This data is stored in a hdf5 file, which I load using a xmf file. Loading
works fine and
I can confirm that by checking the range of my data. cosalpha is the cosine
of an angle and ranges from -1 to 1 for example. Q is also correct.

I want to create an isosurface of Q and color it with cosalpha. However,
after the filter has been applied to Q, the range of cosalpha changes (in
the information panel) and the coloring does not work as expected. It seems
like that cosalpha is taking the range of Q....

Any hint of what I might be doing wrong?

Kind Regards
Tiago

Sorry about that Cory; will keep this in the mailing list.


I have tried to implement your suggestion, and now I have generated a plugin file "libvtkPVGlyphFilterP.so".

Please find the files I used to create this plugin in the attachment.


What I did after compiling the plugin:


  1.  Try to use the new class I made, like such: `session_manager_->NewProxy("filters", "GlyphP")));`
where GlyphP is what I called my custom glyph filter (see the xml file in the attachment).
  2.  Compile my application against "libvtkPVGlyphFilterP.so".
  3.  Run my application and get the following error:

ERROR: In /home/ahmad/paraview/ParaViewCore/ServerImplementation/Core/vtkSIProxyDefinitionManager.cxx, line 526
vtkSIProxyDefinitionManager (0x294d320): No proxy that matches: group=filters and proxy=GlyphP were found.

I feel like I am missing an important step, which has to do with the XML file, but I don't know how.

In the Plugin Wiki of ParaView the instructions I find after compiling are: Then using cmake and a build system, one can build a plugin for this new filter. Once this plugin is loaded the filter will appear under the "Alphabetical" list in the Filters menu.
There are no instructions on how to use the new class in a C++ pipeline...

Any pointers on this?

Best,
Ahmad

Hi Cory,


Thanks for your reply.


I am trying to implement your suggestion of extending the vtkGlyph3D with this additional "scaling by normals".

The idea seems quite straightforward. I was just wondering how to incorporate this new class in my C++ pipeline.

Currently I create the glyph, and set its properties, like this:


vtkSmartPointer<vtkSMSourceProxy> glyph;
        glyph.TakeReference(vtkSMSourceProxy::SafeDownCast(
            session_manager_->NewProxy("filters", "Glyph")));
        controller_->PreInitializeProxy(glyph);

        vtkSMPropertyHelper(glyph, "Input").Set(producer);
        vtkSMPropertyHelper(glyph, "Source").Set(GetCylinderSource(glyph));
        vtkSMPropertyHelper(glyph, "ScaleMode", true).Set(0);
        vtkSMPropertyHelper(glyph, "ScaleFactor", true).Set(1.0);
        vtkSMPropertyHelper(glyph, "GlyphMode", true).Set(0);

As you can see I am not directly working with vtkGlyph3D or vtkPVGlyphFilter classes, but I am using the vtkSMPropertyHelper to take care of the boilerplate code.


Right. Unfortunately, implementing my suggestion would require creating a subclass of vtkPVGlyphFilter and importing that with a ParaView plugin. See the ParaView Howto on how to add a filter to ParaView.

After I created a new class that has this extra scaling option, how would I go about using this in such a pipeline? Do I need to 'register' my "ModifiedGlyph" to the filter proxies to be able to do something like `NewProxy("filters", "ModifiedGlyph")`?

Yes, that should do it. Your modified glyph class will be available once you've imported the ParaView plugin mentioned above.


A quick question about setting the active normals. Is there an existing way to do this, or would I need to do this myself? I would like to do this the same way one would set the "Scalars":


vtkSMPropertyHelper(glyph, "Normals")
            .SetInputArrayToProcess(vtkDataObject::POINT, "ScalingArray");

I think that should work.

Best,
Cory


Looking forward to your reply.

Best,
Ahmad

Hi Ahmad,

Alas, reading the code of vtkGlyph3D, you cannot orient by a vector
array different from the vector array used to do the scaling using the
functionality in ParaView. You would have to modify either
vtkPVGlyphFilter or its parent class vtkGlyph3D, to do this, and
expose the new VTK class through a ParaView plugin [1]. A simple
modification would be to add a ScaleMode, say VTK_SCALE_BY_NORMAL, to
vtkGlyph3D, and then set the active normals in your data set to the
vector by which you wish to scale. Then the "vectors" property could
control the orientation and the active normals would control the
scale. That's kind of kludgey, but it would be a fairly fast
modification to make.

HTH,
Cory

Subject: [Paraview] Integrate Variables Over a Volume
Message-ID: <2F8BA25CC0B82C4DB6756F8F663E6DB36B66A480@CITESMBX3.ad.uillinois.edu>

Hi Everyone,

Is there a way to integrate point or cell data over a volume in ParaView?

It seems the "Integrate Variables" filter only integrates point and cell data over lines and surfaces. From the help documentation:

"The Integrate Attributes filter integrates point and cell data over lines and surfaces. It also computes length of lines, area of surface, or volume. "

I tried integrating over a volume, but this produced an error.

Is there another way to do this?

Any advice would be much appreciated.

Thanks very much,

Apparently if I use multi-block works (I will make a few more tests).

Is there some sort of limitation on the number of points per block?

Hello. The Intergate Variables filter just calculate the area integral of
each variable. If you need the mass flow then your workflow is correct. I
use the same approach:
1. Slice + coordinate thresholds if it's needed to bound the sloce.
2. Calculator filter with the function like
MassFlux=Density*VelocityVector*SurfaceNormalVector
3. Intergate Variables. The MassFlux integral is what we need.
Regarding the time dependence I cannot suggest you something because I
didn't work with transient cases in ParaView (I use CFD Post for
transients).
I also don't know the simple way to filter just one variable to integrate.
If you have lots of variables like in CFD results it's very inconvenient to
dig through all variables in Intagrate results.

[Sorry, I forgot to change the mail address to Paraview. So copying it to
the list.]

Hello. I use ParaView 5.4.1 and I checked Integrate Variables on volume
now. It works but, as in some other cases in ParaView, it requires the
single entities type. For example, if you have a domain (volume) and
boundaries (surfaces), it will not work on you whole input. Use Extract
Block to extract the "real" volume prior the Integrate Variables.
There is the other thing that is not very good concerning this "entity type
problem". If you use the Calculator filter on mixed entities (fluid domain
+ boundaries) it says that it cannot find a variable, although it shows
this variable in it's drop-down list. It's confusing if you encounter this
the first time or have forgotten about this issue. May be it would be
better to introduce some sort of message to inform a user that there is a
"mixed entity issue".

Cory,

As a follow up.  Can I ask if it would be possible to do all that is
suggested on Scott's page:
https://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Advanced_Tips_and_Tricks#
Animating_a_static_vector_field

Along with all of your additional steps below from your last post (be great
to add these to Scott's page), entirely in pvpython or pvbatch?  I make use
of the anaconda version from here: https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/paraview

Would it be possible do you think to script all of this? I have not tired
it yet I should add just checking for show stoppers before I begin.
Thanks,
Andy

I don't foresee any showstoppers. To make scripting easier, use the
Python tracing capability within the ParaView GUI. Tools menu -> Start
Trace, then perform the suggested actions. When done, choose Tools ->
Stop Trace, and you will see a dialog with the generated script that
you can use as a starting point.

I build latest head of paraview-superbuild with Python enabled and USE_SYSTEM_PYTHON=OFF on a openSUSE Tumbleweed system

I get the following error

gmake[7]: *** [CMakeFiles/Makefile2:1192: ThirdParty/cinema/CMakeFiles/CinemaPython.dir/all] Error 2
gmake[7]: *** Waiting for unfinished jobs....

To my knowledge one need to decide if Python is compiled with 16 or 32 bit encoding,

on my system I have 32 bit:

/usr/bin/python2
Python 2.7.14 (default, Oct 12 2017, 15:50:02) [GCC] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import sys
>>> print(sys.maxunicode)
1114111

When I try the Python built from PV, it has 16 bits:

/home/fwein/code/cfs_paraview/build_python/build/superbuild/python/build/python
Python 2.7.14 (default, Feb  2 2018, 15:33:16)
[GCC 7.3.0] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import sys
>>> print(sys.maxunicode)
65535

So the mixing from own built python and system python makes problems.

Is this mixing a bug?

Currently, I don't need python in PV, and for my colleague SYSTEM_PYTHON worked. So just to let you know.

BTW, what is the status with python3?

It get's (for me) strange:

                  U PyUnicodeUCS2_AsEncodedString

nm -D /usr/lib64/python2.7/lib-dynload/_struct.so | grep PyUnico
                  U PyUnicodeUCS4_AsEncodedString

This is as I would expect it. So, I don't understand the error message:

ImportError: /home/fwein/code/cfs_paraview/build_python/build/install/lib64/python2.7/lib-dynload/_struct.so: undefined symbol: PyUnicodeUCS2_AsEncodedString

Is the error message wrong with the filename?

Mabye the path are set wrong?!

Hi Fabian,

It looks to me like you built against a Python that was configured with
UCS2 unicode objects and are linking to a Python that was configured with
UCS4 unicode objects.  Python is not ABI-compatible with other Pythons that
were built with a different kind of unicode support.

Yes, you might need to "Extract Surface" filter, then select the new output
and save the dataset from the menu.

Hi Shawn,

I aggree with your observation. The point is, that not me is linking but it is the paraview-superbuild which failes. With USE_SYSTEM_python=OFF I would expect that my system python is not touched?!

BTW, I can confirm that it works with USE_SYSTEM_python=ON, so a trivial workaround exists.

For Catalyst Live you can use the Python Annotation filter to show the time
after you've extracted the Annotate Time Filter from the Calalyst
simulation run. You'll need to change the Array Association to Row Data and
put in "Text.GetValue(0)" in the Expression.

Ahmad,

First, I recommend that you try loading your plugin in the ParaView
UI, using the ParaView that you built your plugin against. Then, in
Tools -> Manage Plugins. Click on Load New... and select the file
libvtkPVGlyphFilterP.so. You should now be able to find your filter
GlyphP in the Filters menu.

Second, to instantiate the filter the way you are trying is correct,
but first you need to load the plugin. I believe you can do it this
way:

vtkSMPluginManager::LoadLocalPlugin("<path>/<to>/libvtkPVGlyphFilterP.so");

HTH,
Cory

Subject: [Paraview] Issues creating paraview input
Message-ID: <CAEHOsR0Skv-FHe__tLFoERXUtpPh1B1Grx7pL7OcFGQmGxPhfA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I have a multiblock vtu writer and an ASCII tecplot writer that I wrote
for my software several years ago, and seems to work fine when read into
Visit.

However, I am having a very difficult time getting any results to work
in paraview.

Tecplot:

1. Tecplot Files fails when trying to display data
2. Tecplot Files (visit) only sees point data and not any element data.

My assumption for the Tecplot readers is that there is probably a line
length limitation somewhere in both tecplot readers.  Causing the
readers to silently fail in odd places.

Paraview:

Paraview reader is able to read my vtm, and vtu files, once I tell it
that the vtm file is multiblock format.  Surface plots work, but all but
one volume disappears for the volume plot.

Question:

Is there a file format library for Python that is known to generate good
results for Paraview?

An example for these listed requirements would be most helpful:

1. 2d (triangular) or 3d (tetrahedral) mesh
2. multiple blocks to the structure.
3. Vertex centered point data
4. Element centered vector data
5. Use modules available in a full featured Python distribution (like
Anaconda Python).
    - vtk
    - h5py

The reason why I would like it in Python, is that I no longer wish to
compile new file format writers into my application.

Regards,

Juan

Thanks Cory, that's the function I was looking for.


Got it working now ?


I attached a working version for anyone interested; README inside with some instructions

Cheers!

Ahmad,

First, I recommend that you try loading your plugin in the ParaView
UI, using the ParaView that you built your plugin against. Then, in
Tools -> Manage Plugins. Click on Load New... and select the file
libvtkPVGlyphFilterP.so. You should now be able to find your filter
GlyphP in the Filters menu.

Second, to instantiate the filter the way you are trying is correct,
but first you need to load the plugin. I believe you can do it this
way:

vtkSMPluginManager::LoadLocalPlugin("<path>/<to>/libvtkPVGlyphFilterP.so");

HTH,
Cory

Subject: [Paraview] FEM solver interfaced with Paraview
Message-ID: <8ddcee335f6c5358e4c7c3e80a36bb6b@free.fr>

Dear all, 

A while ago, I've initiated an internal project to export results from
my Finite Element solver (mechanical and thermal FEA's) and to visualize
it into Paraview
(https://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2017-November/041481.html);
but I was quite overloaded and this topic has been postponed. 

Currently the format of my the solver is not a part of the list
(https://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Users_Guide/List_of_readers),
and I'm thinking about the strategy to get the results, to perform
additional calculations, and finally to post-process it  into Paraview. 

_Nota_: I'm using 2D and 3D meshes, structures and unstructured ones,
with different element orders, and different type of results (nodal
values and/or cell ones). 

Some of the following questions have probably ever been asked, but: 

 	* What is the best format to create a result file readable by
Paraview, especially for huge file? after some readings, VTK XML format
seems to be the most interesting (parallelization capabilities) compared
to the legacy VTK one, am I right or do ou have any other suggestion?
 	* I'm still trying to figure out if xdmf and/or hdf5 format are
relevant, and if they are relevant for my application: any feedback on
it?

The workflow I'm imaginating sounds like: 

                                                                        
            Intermediate calculations 

                                                                        
                             ^ 

                                                                        
                              | 

Raw data (ascii file) from my solver --> intermediate file in xdmf or
hdf5 format --> Paraview input file (depending on the reader) 

Any feedback, advice and suggestion will be highly appreciated 

(I'm quite new with Paraview) 

Regards 

Paul

To my understanding there is no xdmf OR hdf5: http://xdmf.org/index.php/Main_Page

We also have an own FEM Code. We export directly hdf5 files (w/o xdmf) which we read with an own paraview reader plugin.

Now we would probably try xdmf and see if we can circumvent having an own reader plugin.

hdf5 has libs for all languages (C/C++, Python, Matlab) and e.g. the handling in Python is quite convenient. Almost a one-liner.

The hdf5 C/C++ lib for writing the data is not the best software I know but it is ok.

I would not export to ascii first but directly use the hdf5 libs.

You are right, the VTK XML file formats are quite capable; I would
avoid the legacy formats.

Personally, having worked with writing to both types of data sets, I
would choose VTK XML over XDMF.

If you choose to ultimately write out to VTK XML files, I would skip
the intermediate file writing step.

Subject: [Paraview] Pasting multiple .csv inputs together
Message-ID: <CAOmyp+QfHwj_s+zza4z3GtXevcLJunuVpXmptege+tYKcuajmQ@mail.gmail.com>

All,

Say I have a .csv file containing x, y and z output from a simulation, and
a second .csv file with the same number of rows that contains just a single
column containing something such as pressure.

Is there a Paraview equivalent of the unix 'paste' command that will do a
column bind?

Some way to turn something that might look like:

geom.csv:
x,y,z
-1,-1,0
0,0,1.2
...

press.csv:
pres
1.23
3.45
...

into:
x,y,z,pres
-1,-1,0,1.23
0,0,1.2,3.45
...


Or some way to amend a set of points from TableToPoints with a loaded
.csv?  Obviously the assumption is that the information in the additional
file is in the same order as the loaded geometry.

 Point
Message-ID: <b0329b02-6ca0-ae07-4598-ecae4813dafb@ucmerced.edu>

Hi, I'm trying to find a way to get the average value around a point in 
a mesh that I know to be noisy due to its coarseness. Currently, I am 
unable to understand determine the exact nature of the radius and number 
of point parameters from the documentation ( 
https://www.paraview.org/ParaView/Doc/Nightly/www/py-doc/paraview.simple.ProbeLocation.html 
), but I am guessing from some third party posts that the radius enables 
one to find a point nearby to a desired point in a given region, and the 
number of points expands the amount captured. The problem I have past 
that, if those are correct understandings, is what to do with the probe 
once I have it. Looking at the resulting spreadsheet from using the 
probe location with a given radius and number of points each labelled 
from 0 to 99, for example, it seems that I may have to use another loop, 
after I introduce and use the probe, with code like

my_running_total=0

for y in range(0, 99):
	my_running_total += 
mycalcprobepoint.GetPointData(y).GetArray('Result').GetValue(0)

my_running_total /= 100

that will take that batch of points collected by the probe and average 
all the values I want. Is this the correct interpretation, and a valid 
way to carry out this objective?

Jeremias,

When you set a radius and number of points in the probe filter, then the filter will randomly sample the volume within the defined sphere the number of times requested. The resulting values are the field values at those randomly sampled locations.

An easy way to get an average of your samples is to run the result of the probe filter through the descriptive statistics filter. Look at the "Statistical Model" table and it will report the mean value for each field. (Note that if you are using ParaView 5.4 there is a bug, #17627, that shows the Statistical Model table wrong by default. You have to also change the Composite Data Set Index parameter in the Display part of the properties panel to select only the Derived Statistics block.)

A couple of caveats to this approach. First, because the sampling is random, don't expect the exact same answer every time you run it. Second, if one of the samples happens to lie outside of the mesh, that sample will be filled with 0's for all fields. That will throw off the average value.

That said, another approach you might want to take is to first filter the data in a way that blurs out the noise first. One way you can do that is to run the Point Volume Interpolator filter. Change the Kernel to something like Gaussian (the default Voronoi filter will not do the averaging that you want). Set the radius appropriately. You can then probe the resulting data set with a single value (radius 0) and immediate see the "averaged" result.

    of point parameters from the documentation ( 
    https://www.paraview.org/ParaView/Doc/Nightly/www/py-doc/paraview.simple.ProbeLocation.html 
    ), but I am guessing from some third party posts that the radius enables 
    one to find a point nearby to a desired point in a given region, and the 
    number of points expands the amount captured. The problem I have past 
    that, if those are correct understandings, is what to do with the probe 
    once I have it. Looking at the resulting spreadsheet from using the 
    probe location with a given radius and number of points each labelled 
    from 0 to 99, for example, it seems that I may have to use another loop, 
    after I introduce and use the probe, with code like
    
    my_running_total=0
    
    for y in range(0, 99):
    	my_running_total += 
    mycalcprobepoint.GetPointData(y).GetArray('Result').GetValue(0)
    
    my_running_total /= 100
    
    that will take that batch of points collected by the probe and average 
    all the values I want. Is this the correct interpretation, and a valid 
    way to carry out this objective?

Subject: [Paraview] PythonFullExample does not send any data
Message-ID: <64c182b2855bc54fcfcf3cd0b4d5ea15@fau.de>

Hello,

I am trying to code a tool to send live data from a simulation to 
paraview. I build my paraview with the latest superbuild and with system 
python (3.4m). Then I tried to run the "PythonFullExample". After 
un-commenting line 25 in fedriver.py:
coprocessor.addscript("cpscript.py")
the script still does not send any data. There are no error messages as 
well. I made sure that paraview is listening to the correct port.

In general, I cannot find any python example on how to attach values to 
a poly element or a point.

I am having issues with a new installation of Paraview on a Debian computer. I have loaded the SurfaceLIC plugin and open a vti file. When I select the SurfaceLIC representation Paraview crashes with the following output on the command line:

In  cpscript.py you will need to change the following line:
coprocessor.EnableLiveVisualization(False, 1)

to:
coprocessor.EnableLiveVisualization(True, 1)

As for building VTK objects through the Python API, the VTK Examples at

Thank you very much, it works now.

Since I am getting the initial data via http and process it manually, is 
there a way to "directly" open a connection and send data? I think the 
coprocessor structure is not suitable for my case. Something like:

con = openConnection()

con.sendData(data)
con.sendData(data)
con.sendData(data)

con.close()

where data is something like vtkPolyData. Or, alternatively transfer the 
grid at the beginning and only send the data as vtk*Array itself after 
first initialization.

Cheers,
Simon

What's the intention for this? Thus I could hardly identify the wanted file :[

Hi Simon,

I'm confused a to where the data is being sent from and to. If it's from
the simulation and to the adaptor then all of that would get done before
Catalyst would ever see it. If it's from the adaptor to Catalyst or to the
PV GUI through the Live connection you'll probably want to look at
coprocessing.py and grep through it for "live". I don't look too often at
the Live sections of the code so it would take a bit of time to go through
all of the details on it properly.

Best,
Andy

Is there a probe setting that will simply grab all the points living in 
the original mesh within the radius of the sphere I choose?

I don't seem to be finding any information on what exactly the Gaussian 
kernel does with the data, so how close is it to the plain averaging I 
would like it to be doing?

As far as I know, there is no way to get the probe filter to get all points within a radius as you describe. You may instead consider the Point Data to Cell Data Filter. That will for each cell take the values of all attached points and average them.

The point volume interpolator filter will create a grid (by default 100^3) and, in gaussian kernel mode, will ?splat? a gaussian function onto the grid from every point. Another way to think of it is that a 3D gaussian function is convolved with a 3D function comprising an impulse function at every point in the mesh scaled by the field value (and then sampled on the grid).

Message-ID: <2F8BA25CC0B82C4DB6756F8F663E6DB36B6729B9@CITESMBX3.ad.uillinois.edu>

Hi Everyone,

When generating streamlines from a 3D computation, in some parts, the streamlines appear broken. This is shown in the attached image (the arrows point to the broken parts).

Increasing the "Maximum Streamline Length" parameter did not help.

Using the "Point to Cell Data" filter, and then generating streamlines on the cell data did not help.

Although in the image shown the broken parts are in an area of low velocity, this happens in regions of high velocity as well. It also does not seem to depend on grid resolution, as the broken parts show up all over.

Has anyone experienced anything like this? Any ideas how to work around this?

Thanks very much,

Hi,

You may want to try playing with some of the advanced options for computing
streamlines (click on the gear button in the upper right corner of the
parameters for the filter).

If that doesn't help, you may want to share your dataset so that we can
investigate. Also, is this a 2D simulation? It may be that the streamline
is going out of the plane of your grid and therefore terminating.

Additionally, you can view the ReasonForTermination cell data output to see
why the streamlines terminated. Click on the ? button to see what the
values correspond to.

Hi Everyone,

Thanks very much for all the suggestions.

Setting the streamline interpolator type to:

streamTracer1.InterpolatorType = 'Interpolator with Cell Locator'

solved the problem!

Thanks  again,

Hi Louis,

Is there any chance this is the rendering precision issue called depth buffer fighting? What happens when you turn off display of the plane? Are the streamlines still broken?

Hi Everyone,

When generating streamlines from a 3D computation, in some parts, the streamlines appear broken. This is shown in the attached image (the arrows point to the broken parts).

Increasing the "Maximum Streamline Length" parameter did not help.

Using the "Point to Cell Data" filter, and then generating streamlines on the cell data did not help.

Although in the image shown the broken parts are in an area of low velocity, this happens in regions of high velocity as well. It also does not seem to depend on grid resolution, as the broken parts show up all over.

Has anyone experienced anything like this? Any ideas how to work around this?

Message-ID: <FA84C874-659F-4F23-9F6D-49A9CBE30158@iris.washington.edu>

Hello,

I have a Python reader that creates a vtkPolyData object and when it wants to change its Representation to Points, it returns the following error:

RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded

However, if I run the same sequence of code in the Paraview?s Python Shell:

view = GetRenderView()
src = FindSource('Model_EQ')
dp = GetDisplayProperties(src)
dp.Representation=?Points'

It works just fine. The error is generated when it is executing

dp = GetDisplayProperties(src)

Any suggestions?

Thanks,

?manoch

Is there any way I could render HEX9 exodusii data as as HEX8 data in
paraview,  (ignoring the 9th node) or work with it directly?

HEX9 numbering:
https://github.com/gsjaardema/seacas/blob/master/docs/topology/hex09.png

It appears that Paraview reads the file as HEX8 but is reading the center
node as part of one of the hexahedron's edges (see attached image)

Folks,

I am trying to get a feel is anyone uses this functionality at all. If
not, we'd like to remove it as it simplifies a few interactions,
besides reducing code complexity.

The functionality I am referring to allows one to disconnect from a
remote server and then save animation on the server before the server
exits but after the client has disconnected.

Thanks

Message-ID: <FF818EA9-9F52-4FB2-A1C9-425E5A35E3E6@contoso.com>

I have a problem with unstructured CFD datasets  using the Ensight format.  The following illustrates the problem.  I make a slice at a certain value of y and look at velocity vectors.  Everything is good.  I use calculator to make    a dependent variable from CoordY and contour at the same y value.   These 2 surfaces are identical and shading by any variable yields identical results.   If I put velocity vectors on the  constant y contour surface, they are wrong.  This procedure works as expected with   plot3d structured datasets.  The other thing I?ve noticed, when using a cylindrical slice,  it always uses the y axis.  Setting X or Z anything else has no effect. This happens on all my datasets.   I?m using my own compile of Version 5.4.1 on a mac.  Any ideas, comments or suggestions?
Thanks

Hi Tim,
I don?t know about your first question, but with regarts to a cylindrical slice, this has been fixed in the developers tree (Master).  This will appear fixed in the 5.5.0 release, scheduled for this coming spring.  If you want to try it out, go to paraview.org, then Downloads, then Nightly.

There are numerous bugs on this, but the one I just found and resolved is here: https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/issues/17624

Message-ID: <CAD=kO4v1GKJr07Kpz1_gBfCef=AvfZVbSj5TFvjBuVX6v6TjFQ@mail.gmail.com>

I?m curious if there is a simple way to change the ViewUp property of the
camera for VR to be (0,0,-1) instead of the default (0,0,1).

I use ParaView for geophysical and other geoscientific visualizations where
it is common to define positive Z as down rather than up. Being able to
switch the ViewUp vector to (0,0,-1) would help us keep our axial
conventions when sending to OpenVR.

Thanks,

Ok. Let me rephrase my question. Maybe someone speaks Matlab? Full Matlab Code below (see [1]).

Let's assume I have a 2x2 matrix with color values C=[1 2; 3 4]. Now I can visualize this matrix with on a 2x2 grid with surf in Matlab. What I get is one square with the color values on each node (see Case 1 in the Matlab code). This is what Paraview does!

What I want is the following: I define a new grid, which is 3x3. So one value more in each direction than I have color values. On this grid the color values live cell-centered. If I now visualize this in Matlab, I get a 2x2 block matrix with color values from 1-4. This is what I want!

To sum up: I want to keep my color values, but I want to define a new cell-centered grid (with size(C,1)+1) where these color values live on. Is this somehow possible in Paraview?

Thank you!
Henrik

Dear all,

I have a "Structured (Curvilinear) Grid" (*.vts), which gets read in as 314531 cells and 330000 points. I would like to tell Paraview that this is equidistant cell-centered data (330000 cells). I want every cell to get one color, such that color interpolation becomes correct.

Can I somehow convert the data I have?

Thank you!

the data files https://www.paraview.org/paraview-downloads/download.php?submit=Download&version=v5.4&type=binary&os=Sources&downloadFile=ParaViewData-v5.4.1.tar.gz e.g. have a confusing file naming :(

What's the intention for this? Thus I could hardly identify the wanted file :[

Many thanks for an explanation
Thomas

Hi Simon,

I'm confused a to where the data is being sent from and to. If it's from
the simulation and to the adaptor then all of that would get done before
Catalyst would ever see it. If it's from the adaptor to Catalyst or to the
PV GUI through the Live connection you'll probably want to look at
coprocessing.py and grep through it for "live". I don't look too often at
the Live sections of the code so it would take a bit of time to go through
all of the details on it properly.

Best,
Andy

Thank you very much for your explanations and suggestions. Responses

Is there a probe setting that will simply grab all the points living in
the original mesh within the radius of the sphere I choose?

I don't seem to be finding any information on what exactly the Gaussian
kernel does with the data, so how close is it to the plain averaging I
would like it to be doing?

As far as I know, there is no way to get the probe filter to get all points within a radius as you describe. You may instead consider the Point Data to Cell Data Filter. That will for each cell take the values of all attached points and average them.

The point volume interpolator filter will create a grid (by default 100^3) and, in gaussian kernel mode, will ?splat? a gaussian function onto the grid from every point. Another way to think of it is that a 3D gaussian function is convolved with a 3D function comprising an impulse function at every point in the mesh scaled by the field value (and then sampled on the grid).

 Same here.

I think the unnecessarily complicated unsubscription system might be
broken. I can't reach the next step after pasting the confirmation string.
Not to mention that *there is a next step* after clicking a link in a
confirmation email and then pasting the confirmation string. Whose idea was
it to make unsubscribing more secure than most banking web sites? :)

Yes, the VR support includes setting any axis as view up. From ParaView if
you go to the steam menu, then select the vtk button a dashboard should
show up that gives you the option. I'm not sure if the nightly PV includes
the menu image, if not I have attached it to this email. Just place it in
the directory where you run PV from.

Henrik,

I believe I understand what you are trying to do. However, there is nothing
available in ParaView to do this simply.

You could use the Programmable Filter to create a new structured grid with
the C+1 number of points in each dimension and then set the point data
array in the C-sized grid to be a cell data array in the (C+1)-sized grid.
The data layout is such that that should work. However, you will need to
set up the points manually.

Hope that helps,
Cory

Subject: [Paraview] paraview-superbuild Qt5 not found
Message-ID: <F86E73E97C0FE34698A26619DD4DD9A53B6D30@TW-MBX-P02.cnesnet.ad.cnes.fr>

Hi,

I'm trying to build paraview with the superbuild procedure, and with a custom install of Qt5.

I'm calling cmake with the following options?:
    cmake -Dqt5_enabled=On -DUSE_SYSTEM_qt5=On(/Off) -DQt5_DIR=/path/to/qt/5.9.1/lib/cmake/Qt5 ..

Note that, in doubt, I've also exported Qt5_DIR as an environment variable.

Alas I observe errors like the following

---------------------------
CMake Error at superbuild/cmake/patches/ExternalProject.cmake:2295 (get_property):
  get_property could not find TARGET qt5.  Perhaps it has not yet been
  created.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  superbuild/cmake/patches/ExternalProject.cmake:2568 (_ep_add_configure_command)
  superbuild/cmake/SuperbuildExternalProject.cmake:183 (ExternalProject_add)
  superbuild/cmake/SuperbuildMacros.cmake:881 (_superbuild_ExternalProject_add)
  superbuild/cmake/SuperbuildMacros.cmake:674 (_superbuild_add_project_internal)
  superbuild/CMakeLists.txt:124 (superbuild_process_dependencies)

...
---------------------------


If I don't set qt5_enabled, and if instead I go into the build sub-directory superbuild/paraview/build/ and rerun cmake with "-DPARAVIEW_BUILD_QT_GUI=On" I can succeed. Alas it kind of defects the purpose of a superbuild.

Did I miss something, or is this a bug like the one reported for HDF5 last year?

Regards,

The input setting is `ENABLE_qt5`. The `qt5_enabled` variable indicates
whether Qt5 is being built or not (either by request or because of a
dependency). It's value is set internally and the cache value is not
used.

Subject: [Paraview] Finding Data Range Over All Timesteps Python
Message-ID: <CAD=kO4u+Q00or9mEXoBLeoPWrgZZ0+ZQrpeaOcPeJ85GEufa4w@mail.gmail.com>

I?m curious if there is a way to calculate the range of a data array over
all time steps much like the ?Rescale to data range over all time steps.?

I want to calculate this data range in a Python Programmable Filter in the
RequestInformation() script so that at the start, I have the total range
over all time steps to then perform a normalization over that range in the
RequestData() script that uses that total data range rather than the range
of the data array at that given timestep.

Currently my workaround is: View by the data array -> Start recording a
Trace -> Rescale the colormap to data range over all time steps -> Stop
Trace -> find the range given to the RescaleTransferFunction in the Trace->
hardcode those values into the python programmable filter to perform the
normalization over that min/max range.

Thanks,

Bane

Hi Louis,

Very cool dataset. My guess is that there is a topology problem with this
dataset - some cells that are neighbors but don't exactly share vertices on
neighboring faces. Maybe hanging nodes because of some sort of refinement?
This is usually when the point locator fails. To locate a cell containing a
point, it first locates the closest point and then walks neighboring cells
until it finds a match. The walk will fail if two neighbor cells don't
actually share points because of some weird topology. The cell locators is
the fix to these issues. The reason it is not currently the default is
performance. We are working on improving the cell locator performance so
that it can be the default behavior in the future.

Also, as Andy mentioned, the ReasonForTermination array provides good info
for debugging such issues. Here are the possible values:

    OUT_OF_DOMAIN = 0,
    NOT_INITIALIZED = 1 ,
    UNEXPECTED_VALUE = 2,
    OUT_OF_LENGTH = 4,
    OUT_OF_STEPS = 5,
    STAGNATION = 6,

If you see OUT_OF_DOMAIN inside the mesh, it is usually an indication that
you should either fix your mesh or use the cell locator.

Best,
-berk

Hi all,

Thought I would pass a success story around.  I just watched a user open a 102 million cell dataset, with two thousand files per timestep, using 58 Gig of memory, on a standalone version of ParaView.   Slow, but it all held together.

ParaView rocks.

Hello,


I am having trouble applying the Process Id Scalars filter to my 2D parallel rectilinear data. The filter is always grayed out, even when I have the data selected in the pipeline. Is there any reason that this filter would not work for my data?


Thank you,

Can you open a new, clean ParaView, remote server, and do the following:?


  *   Sources/ Plane
  *   Filters/ Alphabetical/ Process Id Scalars

If not, look at Help/ About/ Connection Information.  Does Remote Connection say Yes?

Dear Cory,

Thank you very much for your reply! I think, then I will build the new grid in my application already. With this I do not need to go through complicated post-processing steps.

Thank you!
Henrik

Henrik,

I believe I understand what you are trying to do. However, there is nothing available in ParaView to do this simply.

You could use the Programmable Filter to create a new structured grid with the C+1 number of points in each dimension and then set the point data array in the C-sized grid to be a cell data array in the (C+1)-sized grid. The data layout is such that that should work. However, you will need to set up the points manually.

Hope that helps,
Cory

Let?s assume I have a 2x2 matrix with color values C=[1 2; 3 4]. Now I can visualize this matrix with on a 2x2 grid with surf in Matlab. What I get is one square with the color values on each node (see Case 1 in the Matlab code). This is what Paraview does!

What I want is the following: I define a new grid, which is 3x3. So one value more in each direction than I have color values. On this grid the color values live cell-centered. If I now visualize this in Matlab, I get a 2x2 block matrix with color values from 1-4. This is what I want!

To sum up: I want to keep my color values, but I want to define a new cell-centered grid (with size(C,1)+1) where these color values live on. Is this somehow possible in Paraview?

Thank you!

Betreff: [Paraview] Visualize equdistant cell-centered data

Dear all,

I have a ?Structured (Curvilinear) Grid? (*.vts), which gets read in as 314531 cells and 330000 points. I would like to tell Paraview that this is equidistant cell-centered data (330000 cells). I want every cell to get one color, such that color interpolation becomes correct.

Can I somehow convert the data I have?

Thank you!
Henrik B?sing

Message-ID: <0225304A-DF5E-4263-BD9E-3F6A28BA47BE@bluequartz.net>

Can ParaView 5.4.1 open a .vtk file? I have tried and I get the dialog that presents the big long list of possible file readers. Nothing on that list seems to say "vtk" files. Odd. ?

Probably "user error" but this seems like it used to work? macOS 10.13.x with the latest download from the ParaView web site.

Mike,

That happens when the chosen reader for .vtk files reported that it
can't read the file for some reason. If you can share the file, we can
see why the reader is claiming it can't read the file.

Hi Weston,

Not without modifying the source. Have you built ParaView yourself or do you install it from packages.

It would help to have a small example file for us to test against. If you want to experiment, you can edit VTK/IO/Exodus/vtkExodusIIReader.cxx around line 3237 (inside vtkExodusIIReaderPrivate::DetermineVtkCellType) and add

  else if ((elemType.substr(0,3) == "HEX") &&      (binfo.BdsPerEntry[0] == 9))
    { binfo.CellType=VTK_HEXAHEDRON;               binfo.PointsPerCell = 8; }

You can see that is what we do for 21-node hexes currently.

Usually just from the paraview tarballs, i can try adding the new change
code next week though.

Attached is a small example file (lid driven cavity, ldc.exoII) and an
example output image of a slice with velocity vectors in ensight

Mark,

As  I was re-reading your email while working on issue #1792 [1] which
affects the save animation dialog, I have a few questions: Are you
saving the movie as AVI (and on what platform). If so doesn't changing
"Frame Rate" have the same effect for avi? If you set your frame rate
to 1 frame/second, doesn't that yeild exactly what you're looking for
-- each frame stays on for 1s with discrete jumps and no
interpolation? Atleast on linux/mac where the FFMPEG writer is used, I
can see that the frame rate of 1 fps works as expected. What am I
missing?

Thanks,
Utkarsh

Hello Scott,


Thanks for your reply. It seems I had a misunderstanding of what Process Id Scalars accomplishes. I am actually running Paraview sequentially but loading decomposed data. I'm wondering if there is a way to see how the domain was decomposed when the simulation was running? I could open each file and see the owned indices, but I was hoping for a visual representation.


For each processor and time step I have a ".pvtr" file and a ".vtr" file.


Do I need to output the process rank to each node in each data file? I would assume there's a better way...


Nick

Can you open a new, clean ParaView, remote server, and do the following:?

If not, look at Help/ About/ Connection Information.  Does Remote Connection say Yes?

Hello,



I am having trouble applying the Process Id Scalars filter to my 2D parallel rectilinear data. The filter is always grayed out, even when I have the data selected in the pipeline. Is there any reason that this filter would not work for my data?

Hi all,


I?m using VeloView 3.5.0 (Windows 64bit) and recording VLP-16?s data packets.
I want to set the total recording time or stopping time, but VeloView have no option to do it on the GUI.

Is there a good way? (ex. using Python)

Indeed. Thanks you Ben, and the others that've answered me.
I totally missed this option.

Bane,

You could run Temporal Statistics to get Max and Min over entire time range, then run calculator to get Range as (Max-Min).

Then you could run your filter on this and use the variable from the calculator.

Hope this helps

Subject: [Paraview] Possible to view ExodusII HEX9 data?

Using

  else if ((elemType.substr(0,3) == "HEX") && (binfo.BdsPerEntry[0] == 9))
    { binfo.CellType=VTK_HEXAHEDRON;          binfo.PointsPerCell = 9; }

Appears to render correctly (see attached plot)

I changed the Points per cell to 9 as well, with it as 8 the output was the
same as before.

I'm guessing this is because exodus stores arrays by element (e.g. [<values
for element 1, nodes 1 to 9>, <values for element 2, nodes 1 to 9>, ...
etc.]) and PointsPerCell is used to index into these

If so your hex21 might also need to be changed, cubit/trelis doesn't
support hex21 so I couldn't check.

Thanks,

Weston

Hi Weston,

Thanks for the report and the test data. I'll see that the fix gets merged in for both HEX9 and HEX21.

Subject: [Paraview] Questions on Add Selection/Subtract Selection
Message-ID: <DM5PR0701MB3831B1E4E242F81AE8CE6E4A9FF60@DM5PR0701MB3831.namprd07.prod.outlook.com>

All,

I am writing some instructional material for my users and am working on "Interactive Selection".    As I try to write this I realize that the rules for +/- Selection are confusing to me.    Can someone verify that what I'm doing is the intended behavior.

If I Click on "Select Cells Through" or "Select Points Through", then Add Selection and Subtract Selection are greyed out and not available.  There are instances where I want to combine "Select Cells On", "Select Cells by Polygon", and "Select Cells Through" to finetune my final selection - similar for Points.

Add/Subtract don't seem to work between all of the interactive selection methods, which is what I would intuitively expect:

For example - click on Add Selection - it will remain highlighted thru the following actions:
     click on Select Cells On - now you can select cells
     click again on "Select Cells On" - you can select more cells that are added to the previous selection
     click on "Select Cells with Polygon" - you can select more cells that are added to the previous selection.
     click on "Select Block" - block is selected and all previously selected cells are unselected
     click again on "Select Block" - new block is selected and added to previous selection
     clock on "Select Cells On" - new cells are selected and previous selection is discarded.

The two things which don't seem intuitive are:

Why are "Select Cells/Points Through" not using Add Selection - in many cases it is necessary to select using different interactive methods to get the final desired selection.

Should Select Block be divided into "Select Block Cells" and "Select Block Points" so that this selection method could be combined with Select Cells/Points On/Through with the "Add Selection" to finetune a selection.    Alternately should "Select Block" be smarter and only select Block Cells if the current Selection is Cells, or only select Block Points if the current Selection is Points (and add them to the existing selection instead of replacing it?

I realize I may be missing something here, so I'm really just asking for someone to clue me in if I am.

Thanks for any insight
Dennis

An implementation nuance, and no one asked for it :). The extract
filter just support extracting a single frustum. We, in theory can
make it support multiple additive frustums, but some additive, some
subtractive will make it a trickier implementation. Of course, doable,
not since no one asked for it, it never got around to getting
implemented.

Ah! That's cool and not easily supportable the way things are
currently. But Berk and I were chatting and we have an approach to
support combining multiple selections add/remove/etc. nicely. Now just
convince Alan to make it a priority and I'd love to have it sorted out
for the SC release ;).

Subject: [Paraview] Python programmable source
Message-ID: <2B46F6DC-E5D2-49D8-B526-2250F64F50D6@iris.washington.edu>

Hello,

I have created a Python programmable source to populate and display a vtkPolyData. All works well, however, I would like to change display settings via the same Python code. I found out that after I press The Apply button I can modify the script to set the representation type to ?Points? but if I place a GetDisplayProperties statement at the end of the script initially to gain access to these properties, I will get: 

Traceback (most recent call last):
File "<string>", line 20, in <module>
File "<string>", line 82, in RequestData
File "/Applications/ParaView-5.4.1-822-g597adef982.app/Contents/Python/paraview/simple.py", line 454, in GetDisplayProperties
return GetRepresentation(proxy, view)
File "/Applications/ParaView-5.4.1-822-g597adef982.app/Contents/Python/paraview/simple.py", line 437, in GetRepresentation
view = active_objects.view
File "/Applications/ParaView-5.4.1-822-g597adef982.app/Contents/Python/paraview/simple.py", line 2213, in get_view
self.__get_selection_model("ActiveView").GetCurrentProxy())
File "/Applications/ParaView-5.4.1-822-g597adef982.app/Contents/Python/paraview/simple.py", line 2191, in __get_selection_model
pxm = servermanager.ProxyManager(session)
RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded

How can I address this problem?

Thanks,

The programmable source was designed to work on the server-side data only.
By the fact that you're using the built-in server (i.e. the ParaView GUI
and pvserver run in the same process space) you have access to client-side
information like representation type but that stuff is only available after
you've fully executed the programmable source script.

You may want to look at using the Python trace functionality and then
saving that as a macro. That should be a more consistent solution that also
works with a remote pvserver.

Subject: [Paraview] Problem with paraview and Protocol Buffer version
Message-ID: <0763a86f-ef1e-1e8d-079f-dc7286dea8dd@ethz.ch>

Dear all,

I am having trouble building Paraview 5.2.0 (This version or older is 
required for a separate plug-in). Other installations of paraview (not 
compiled from source) work fine.

I run Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. I check out the paraview 5.2.0 release and 
installed Qt5.6.3 (also tried 5.6 and 5.7 because I had trouble with Qt 
during the paraview build earlier) in a separate directory. I have my 
(empty) build directory paraview_bin and paraview 5.2.0 source in 
/home/user/software/paraview_bin and /home/user/software/paraview 
respectively.

- export PATH=/opt/Qt/5.6.3/gcc_64/:$PATH

- ccmake -D PARAVIEW_QT_VERSION:STRING=5 /path/to/paraview

- BUILD_TESTING --> OFF

- generation and make completes

The build works fine, but when I try to execute I get a protobuf error


user:~/software/paraview_bin$ ./bin/paraview
libprotobuf FATAL /home/user/software/paraview/ThirdParty/protobuf/vtkprotobuf/src/google/protobuf/stubs/common.cc:62]
This program requires version 2.6.0 of the Protocol Buffer runtime library, but the installed version is 2.3.0.
Please update your library.
If you compiled the program yourself, make sure that your headers are from the same version of Protocol Buffers as your link-time library.
(Version verification failed in "/build/mir-O8_xaj/mir-0.26.3+16.04.20170605/obj-x86_64-linux-gnu/src/protobuf/mir_protobuf.pb.cc".)
Aborted

although my protoc version seems fine

user:~/software/paraview_bin$ protoc --version
libprotoc 2.6.1

I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling protoc and libprotobuf as 
well as reinstalling Qt afterwards, but can not figure out this error.

Any suggestions?

Thanks a bunch,

Dan

Utkarsh,

How about a "Freeze Selection" choice like in Find Data that would convert a frustrum selection into an ID-based selection which would enable the use of Add Selection using another frustrum or any of the other Selection tools.

Thoughtfully yours,
Dennis

An implementation nuance, and no one asked for it :). The extract filter just support extracting a single frustum. We, in theory can make it support multiple additive frustums, but some additive, some subtractive will make it a trickier implementation. Of course, doable, not since no one asked for it, it never got around to getting implemented.

Ah! That's cool and not easily supportable the way things are currently. But Berk and I were chatting and we have an approach to support combining multiple selections add/remove/etc. nicely. Now just convince Alan to make it a priority and I'd love to have it sorted out for the SC release ;).

Hello, Daniel.
I have encountered the same trouble as you, Linux Mint (based on ubuntu 16.04). I did not seek for a solution yet (no need for linux version right now), but the answer is in the error output. If you inspect  the 3rd party protobuf bundled with ParaView VTK submodule, then you can see that original version used by VTK is 2.3.0
So I think, that during compilation it uses the system headers from ubuntu (which is 2.6.1), but links on internal VTK protobuf library which is 2.3.0.
My guessing is - remove dev package of protobuf from system and recompile again, it might help.

Hi Cory, dear Artem,

Thanks for the mails. Regarding the issue Cory sent.


When doing the following:

I moved libqgtk2.so (not libqgtk3.so in my case) from 
/opt/Qt/5.9.0/gcc_64/plugins/platformthemes

and commented _all_ lines in 
/opt/Qt/5.9/gcc_64/lib/cmake/Qt5Gui/Qt5Gui_QGtk3ThemePlugin.cmake

I then rebuild paraview (build succeeds) but when I try to execute

user:~/software/paraview_bin$ ./bin/paraview
libprotobuf FATAL 
/home/user/software/paraview/ThirdParty/protobuf/vtkprotobuf/src/google/protobuf/stubs/common.cc:62] 
This program requires version 2.6.0 of the Protocol Buffer runtime 
library, but the installed version is 2.3.0.? Please update your 
library.? If you compiled the program yourself, make sure that your 
headers are from the same version of Protocol Buffers as your link-time 
library.? (Version verification failed in 
"/build/mir-O8_xaj/mir-0.26.3+16.04.20170605/obj-x86_64-linux-gnu/src/protobuf/mir_protobuf.pb.cc".)
Aborted


I still have no success. I still have other version of Qt installed 
(also in opt) and did not uninstall "qt5-gtk-platformtheme" as suggested 
by Timo Oster in the thread you sent. Could any of this be the problem? 
I am hesitant to uninstall qt5-gtk-platformtheme as I'm not sure if 
that'll give me another conflict.

Did I forget anything?

Daniel

That's a temporary workaround. It won't be a good approach for large
datasets as frustum selection has the potential of selecting a large
number of elements. Since for ID based selections, each ID has to be
explicitly listed in the proxy state (so that it gets saved in state
files, python scripts etc.), it not intended to contain a large number
of values.

To follow up on this thread?

On OS X, running PV as an app, then opening the Python shell, I get:
>>> os.environ
{'SHELL': '/bin/bash', 'SSH_AUTH_SOCK': '/private/tmp/com.apple.launchd.yYfqa8v89A/Listeners', 'XPC_FLAGS': '0x0', '__CF_USER_TEXT_ENCODING': '0x1F5:0x0:0x0', 'Apple_PubSub_Socket_Render': '/private/tmp/com.apple.launchd.dl97FcplnG/Render', 'LOGNAME': 'heiland', 'USER': 'heiland', 'XPC_SERVICE_NAME': 'org.paraview.ParaView.37836', 'PATH': '/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin', 'HOME': '/Users/heiland', 'DISPLAY': '/private/tmp/com.apple.launchd.Xf3Uaw6FhP/org.macosforge.xquartz:0', 'TMPDIR': '/var/folders/l6/s467rzgs75n91gdbkn7vr0f40000gn/T/'}
>>>

however, running it as:
/Applications/ParaView-5.4.1.app/Contents/MacOS$ ./paraview 
?
the os.environ spews ALL envs in my bash shell.


If there?s another option, outside of using env vars, for dynamically getting a user-defined string inside a Programmable Source, I?d welcome it.

Hello

Switching to a downloaded version of Qt (with the patch cory mentionned)
instead of using your package manager's Qt should do the trick.

Hello everyone,

so i did some research and ldd shows that platformthemes/libqgtk3.so is linked to libprotobuf.so itself. Actually, does not matter of which version, not 2.3.0 and this is essential. I used Qt 5.10.0 binary distribution.

To make ParaView work just remove that libqgtk3.so and it will run smoothly. No need to patch anything or rebuild. Just make the qt libs do not load that theme library.

The "good way" solution is to update VTK protobuf to something fresh. Rebuilding a platform theme part of Qt with VTK protobuf library does not worth time spent on it. IMHO, of course :-)

I have described another possible solution, if you build a ParaView from sources, in comment to issue mentioned above:
https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/issues/17751 <https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/issues/17751>

Copying it here: 
Another possible solution for those who builds a ParaView from sources:
Enable VTK_USE_SYSTEM_PROTOBUF option when configuring with cmake. 

cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/home/bodrin/Qt5.10.0/5.10.0/gcc_64_lib/cmake -DVTK_USE_SYSTEM_PROTOBUF=ON ...

Not need to remove something or else. Make sure you have protobuf-compiler and libprotobuf-dev packages installed from repository.
Perform a clean build or remove generated vtkPVMessage.pb.cc and vtkPVMessage.pb.h

Hello Magician,

I think you can use Python, and PythonQt to make a fake "record" button
press, after the desired amount of time.
Just try this:
def myfunc():
    vv.app.actions['actionRecord'].toggle()
    print ("Toggled recording")

qq=QtCore.QTimer()
qq.setSingleShot(True)
qq.connect('timeout()',myfunc)
recordingTimeInMilliseconds = 60 * 1000
qq.start(recordingTimeInMilliseconds)

Hope this helps,

All,

I am looking to calculate a mesh quality measure that would be the ratio of the max/min of the element volumes of each element and all it's neighbors (other elements with common nodes).  I intend to use this to quantify grid refinement transitions and perhaps establish some design standards for them.    I have tried Gradient of Element Volume, but I need to eliminate the distance part of that to get the number that I want.    So, if I have a hex element in a regular grid,  I would expect to have 26 "neighbor" elements plus the original element.    The number I want is  (max of 27 element volumes)/(min of 27 element volumes).    This quantity will highlight mesh refinement transitions.

My question (at last) is:    how do I find all the neighbor elements (share at least 1 node) of each element in my model?   I'd like to do this in a Programmable Filter.  I'm afraid I don't know much about how connectivity is implemented in vtk.

Hi Dennis,

I'm assuming you're dealing with a vtkUnstructuredGrid (for the
topologically regular grids you should just use the extent information).
You'll want to look at the GetCellNeighbors() method --
https://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkUnstructuredGrid.html#ac532485599a5d92acf4d9ca1e8818bfc.
Here, cellId is the cell you want to get the neighbors from, ptIds is the
list of points that need to be shared by both cells and cellIds is the
return list. You'll have to iterate over all points of the cell you're
interested in (i.e. call GetCellNeighbors() 8 times for a hex).

The basic algorithm is:
loop over cells:
  for each cell, loop over all of its points
    for each point call GeCellNeighbors(cellid, point id list with a single
point)
      loop through cellids to compare cell sizes

Please let me know if this isn't clear enough to get you going...

Cheers,
Andy

Mohammed,

The answer to your question depends on a lot of things.

Depending on your simulation, it might be easiest if the simulation itself detected when a particle exits the pipe. It is, after all, the thing tracking the particles to begin with. From there it could output its count in a csv file. You could load that up and plot in in ParaView, although a typical spreadsheet program can do that as well.

Assuming it is not feasible to have your simulation do the count, getting ParaView to do it depends on a lot of things. First, it depends on whether particles ?die? in your simulation. It is pretty common in simulation code to have particles leave the defined domain (or otherwise become invalid) and then get removed from the list of particles that get written out. If particles never die, then your job in ParaView is easier. You can just count how many particles are past the out end of the pipe and count that.

If particles are born or die in your simulation, then the problem becomes much more difficult.

Message-ID: <5bceaa09-ef02-9faa-63c3-ebaa7b0ff2cd@gmail.com>

Dear Paraview Community,

I have simulation data that is time dependent and distributed over 
multiple processors.

I happily view slices through this data in time while playing the 
animation. In particular, I can see the displacement of an interface 
through time. I have done some python scripting, starting from the trace 
function, but I cannot at the moment do the following:

Plot the location of the interface through time. In other words, take 
the information from the animation and put it in one plot.

To be clear: I want to extract a value (a position gotten by slicing) at 
each time step and compile this into one x vs t plot.

I'd be grateful for any guidance on how to achieve this. I'd be very 
happy if this turns out to be an easy thing to do. Given the general 
nature of the forum and this message, I am of course happy to provide 
more details to make my solicitation for information more fruitful.

Best,

Sean

  for each cell, loop over all of its points
    for each point call GeCellNeighbors(cellid, point id list with a single point)
      loop through cellids to compare cell sizes

Please let me know if this isn't clear enough to get you going...
Cheers,
Andy

The number I want is  (max of 27 element volumes)/(min of 27 element volumes).    This quantity will highlight mesh refinement transitions.

My question (at last) is:    how do I find all the neighbor elements (share at least 1 node) of each element in my model?   I?d like to do this in a Programmable Filter.  I?m afraid I don?t know much about how connectivity is implemented in vtk.

Have you looked at  "Plot Selection Over Time"? It does exactly that.
Attached is an image and state file for ParaView 5.4.1 that demos the
same. You can use can.ex2 found in ParaView tutorial data to load the
state.

Hi Bastien,


Thanks for your advice.
I tried the script and the button is toggled on the GUI, but no data is recorded.

Hi,

I have experienced a similar situation with a vtkUnstructuredGrid, and
written a programmable filter something like:
----
import numpy as np

input = self.GetInput()
output = self.GetOutput()

numCells = input.GetNumberOfCells()

volChange = vtk.vtkFloatArray()
volChange.SetName("volumeChange")
volChange.SetNumberOfComponents(1)
volChange.SetNumberOfTuples(numCells)

for cellId in range(numCells):
  cell = input.GetCell(cellId)

  maxVol = -vtk.VTK_DOUBLE_MAX
  minVol = vtk.VTK_DOUBLE_MAX

  nFaces = cell.GetNumberOfFaces()
  for faceId in range(nFaces):
    pntIds = cell.GetFace(faceId).GetPointIds()

    neighbors = vtk.vtkIdList()
    input.GetCellNeighbors(cellId, pntIds, neighbors)

    numNei = neighbors.GetNumberOfIds()
    for num in range(numNei):
      neiId = neighbors.GetId(num)
      nei = input.GetCell(neiId)
      if nei.GetCellType() == vtk.VTK_TETRA:
        p1 = input.GetPoint(nei.GetPointId(0))
        p2 = input.GetPoint(nei.GetPointId(1))
        p3 = input.GetPoint(nei.GetPointId(2))
        p4 = input.GetPoint(nei.GetPointId(3))
        vol = vtk.vtkTetra.ComputeVolume(p1, p2, p3, p4)
        maxVol = np.maximum(maxVol, vol)
        minVol = np.minimum(minVol, vol)

  input.GetCell(cellId)
  #print(str(cellId) + ':' + str(maxVol/minVol))
  volChange.SetValue(cellId, maxVol/minVol)

output.GetCellData().AddArray(volChange)
----

Notice this computes the volumes of all cells that neighbor a cell on its
faces.

Sorry, I should have doubled checked
You need to use .trigger() instead of .toggle().
This is the code that works:

def myfunc():
    vv.app.actions['actionRecord'].trigger()
    print ("Toggled recording")

qq=QtCore.QTimer()
qq.setSingleShot(True)
qq.connect('timeout()',myfunc)
recordingTimeInMilliseconds = 60 * 1000
qq.start(recordingTimeInMilliseconds)

Kenichiro,

Thanks for the idea.   This looks very good and I very much appreciate you sharing that with me.

Hi,

I have experienced a similar situation with a vtkUnstructuredGrid, and written a programmable filter something like:
----
import numpy as np

input = self.GetInput()
output = self.GetOutput()

numCells = input.GetNumberOfCells()

volChange = vtk.vtkFloatArray()
volChange.SetName("volumeChange")
volChange.SetNumberOfComponents(1)
volChange.SetNumberOfTuples(numCells)

for cellId in range(numCells):
  cell = input.GetCell(cellId)

  maxVol = -vtk.VTK_DOUBLE_MAX
  minVol = vtk.VTK_DOUBLE_MAX

  nFaces = cell.GetNumberOfFaces()
  for faceId in range(nFaces):
    pntIds = cell.GetFace(faceId).GetPointIds()

    neighbors = vtk.vtkIdList()
    input.GetCellNeighbors(cellId, pntIds, neighbors)

    numNei = neighbors.GetNumberOfIds()
    for num in range(numNei):
      neiId = neighbors.GetId(num)
      nei = input.GetCell(neiId)
      if nei.GetCellType() == vtk.VTK_TETRA:
        p1 = input.GetPoint(nei.GetPointId(0))
        p2 = input.GetPoint(nei.GetPointId(1))
        p3 = input.GetPoint(nei.GetPointId(2))
        p4 = input.GetPoint(nei.GetPointId(3))
        vol = vtk.vtkTetra.ComputeVolume(p1, p2, p3, p4)
        maxVol = np.maximum(maxVol, vol)
        minVol = np.minimum(minVol, vol)

  input.GetCell(cellId)
  #print(str(cellId) + ':' + str(maxVol/minVol))
  volChange.SetValue(cellId, maxVol/minVol)

output.GetCellData().AddArray(volChange)
----

Notice this computes the volumes of all cells that neighbor a cell on its faces.

Thanks,

Andy,

Thanks for that hint ? I think I get the idea.   This is a ?as time is available? project, so I?ll start exploring it, but I appreciate being pointed in the right direction.

Hi Dennis,
I'm assuming you're dealing with a vtkUnstructuredGrid (for the topologically regular grids you should just use the extent information). You'll want to look at the GetCellNeighbors() method -- https://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkUnstructuredGrid.html#ac532485599a5d92acf4d9ca1e8818bfc<https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vtk.org%2Fdoc%2Fnightly%2Fhtml%2FclassvtkUnstructuredGrid.html%23ac532485599a5d92acf4d9ca1e8818bfc&data=01%7C01%7Cdennis_conklin%40goodyear.com%7Cf1004f8cac4a459ffdb908d573dbed3d%7C939e896692854a9a9f040887efe8aae0%7C0&sdata=L4bbRrKp82mtwWrnYEN6BqxNWNOkPVGp9Oa%2BMj7I7KU%3D&reserved=0>. Here, cellId is the cell you want to get the neighbors from, ptIds is the list of points that need to be shared by both cells and cellIds is the return list. You'll have to iterate over all points of the cell you're interested in (i.e. call GetCellNeighbors() 8 times for a hex).
The basic algorithm is:
loop over cells:
  for each cell, loop over all of its points
    for each point call GeCellNeighbors(cellid, point id list with a single point)
      loop through cellids to compare cell sizes

Please let me know if this isn't clear enough to get you going...
Cheers,
Andy

All,

I am looking to calculate a mesh quality measure that would be the ratio of the max/min of the element volumes of each element and all it?s neighbors (other elements with common nodes).  I intend to use this to quantify grid refinement transitions and perhaps establish some design standards for them.    I have tried Gradient of Element Volume, but I need to eliminate the distance part of that to get the number that I want.    So, if I have a hex element in a regular grid,  I would expect to have 26 ?neighbor? elements plus the original element.    The number I want is  (max of 27 element volumes)/(min of 27 element volumes).    This quantity will highlight mesh refinement transitions.

My question (at last) is:    how do I find all the neighbor elements (share at least 1 node) of each element in my model?   I?d like to do this in a Programmable Filter.  I?m afraid I don?t know much about how connectivity is implemented in vtk.

Good evening ParaView

I am doing simulation Using MFiX software
Using ParaView to post-process I used Programmable filter to count No. of particles after clibing the geometry in the middle (approximately) . put while trying to run it I got errors . attached vtp files and stl for the geometry.

Hi,

Can you share your programmable filter code? I don't see anything
wrong with the dataset.

Subject: [Paraview] Python Programmable Filter Timesteps
Message-ID: <CAD=kO4ud9HLLD0hkiATUY9CBF6yK4P8uB9HYiwN2sN72JpoEKQ@mail.gmail.com>

Is it possible to add time steps in a Programmable Filter? For example, I
have read a single static csv file with the normal delimited text reader
and I want to iterate over each row of that file at different time steps.

My RequestInformation script:
    executive = self.GetExecutive()
    outInfo = executive.GetOutputInformation(0)
    #- Get number of rows in table and use that for num time steps
    pdi = self.GetInput()
    nrows = int(pdi.GetColumn(0).GetNumberOfTuples())
# Calculate list of time steps
xtime = range(0,nrows)
    outInfo.Remove(executive.TIME_STEPS())
    for i in range(len(xtime)):
        outInfo.Append(executive.TIME_STEPS(), xtime[i])
    # Remove and set time range info
    outInfo.Remove(executive.TIME_RANGE())
    outInfo.Append(executive.TIME_RANGE(), xtime[0])
    outInfo.Append(executive.TIME_RANGE(), xtime[-1])

Then my Request Data script:
pdi = self.GetInput()
pdo = self.GetOutput()
# grab coordinates for each part of boring machine at time idx as row
executive = self.GetExecutive()
outInfo = executive.GetOutputInformation(0)
idx = outInfo.Get(executive.UPDATE_TIME_STEP())
print("Current time step: ?, idx)
# NOW I SHOULD BE ABLE TO USE IDX TO ITERATE OVER EACH ROW OF THE INPUT
VTKTABLE



The time steps printed in Request Data do not reflect the time steps set in
Request Information. However if I add this little snippet to the Request
Data call it prints out the expected time steps:
print(self.GetExecutive().GetOutputInformation(0).Get(vtk.vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline.TIME_STEPS()))

Is there something I am missing, or can timesteps only be set this way in a
Programmable Source?

I fixed this issue by adding a time step attribute to the XML of this as a
plugin following this blog post
https://blog.kitware.com/easy-customization-of-the-paraview-python-programmable-filter-property-panel/

ExtraXml = '''\
    <DoubleVectorProperty
      name="TimestepValues"
      repeatable="1"
      information_only="1">
      <TimeStepsInformationHelper/>
          <Documentation>
          Available timestep values.
          </Documentation>
    </DoubleVectorProperty>

Subject: [Paraview] Embedding paraview in PyQt application
Message-ID: <CAOJY6rddueVhFtPsrKSZT=mnEXNuWv9ciJoEfsSBwiwV0BWcJQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am trying to embed paraview into my PyQt application but I have some
problems with python threading. For example, in my application I use my own
interactor style in which when user clicks left mouse button it executes
import time;time.sleep(2). But because of that there is a segfault.

This is what I tried so far:
I tried to build paraview changing these variables:
VTK_PYTHON_FULL_THREADSAFE
VTK_NO_PYTHON_THREAD
But there was no effect. Even when I disabled python threads time.sleep
caused segfault.

is there anything else I can try to do?

Thanks,
Rustem

Copying to the paraview users list.

I don't know that filter well.  Try playing with it, and if it doesn't cooperate, let me know.  I will then try...

    Thanks. It worked. Now the filter is active. However, I am not sure what normal and origin coordinate I should put for the Slice filter to end up with a 3D cylinder rotated about y axis.
    Do you have any clue?
    
     I am OK to move it to the e_mail list.

    Just a guess - this filter requires 2d polygonal data.  What I just did was Wavelet, then Slice.  Maybe your data is actually 3d?  Try running a slice filter on it first?
    
    Mind moving this to the paraview at paraview.org e-mail list, so everyone can see the answer?

Message-ID: <CABrYh3o5ALPAHi7u5NVJ60KQuA6jDnOoSQST9LtyJisxCZQ3CQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all:

When I see a Paraviewweb example like this (from Composite.html):

import CompositeComponent from '..';
import BGColorComponent from '../../BackgroundColor';

Where should I look for BackgroundColor and CompositeComponent? I feel sure
I could find them eventually, but is there another search algorithm besides
brute force?

Thank you,

 -Tom

Hi Tom,
The ParaviewWeb examples always live in a sub-directory of the component
they illustrate - so here, this is the Composite example, so '..' just
refers to 'Composite'.
If you look in the left menu, you can see that 'Composite' is grouped into
' Component/Native'. That's the directory it's in.  '../../BackgroundColor'
is a sibling directory to 'Composite', so it will also be in '
Component/Native'

Generally you can follow the '..' out from the example sub-directory and
figure out where you are.

Hope that helps,
Aron

Thank you. it would be great also to have pointers to normalize.css, and
the webpack and package configs for these examples. They are more like
puzzles than examples in their current state, with the challenge to find
all the missing pieces and guess how to put them together. Am I missing
some intro that steps me through those parts? Or is there a way to see the
whole example laid out with those other pieces? Maybe an npm install option
that will give me these examples on my disk?

I see fragments of examples on this page:
https://kitware.github.io/paraviewweb/docs/import.html , but apparently it
is not enough for me.

Thank you,

 -Tom

I think you're looking for the setup doc:
https://kitware.github.io/paraviewweb/docs/setup.html
It gives you a sample webpack config. Nearly all the paraviewweb
dependencies are contained in kw-websuite, as documented on that page.

The examples as they stand use a bit of magic, you are right, so they can
be embedded in the documentation pages. AFAIK, we don't have an install
option to make a stand-alone example.
Regards,
Aron

Subject: [Paraview] Finding all the points associated with one closed
 contour line
Message-ID: <bbfd1c00-ab70-46bc-6703-3c60091662f1@shuhaowu.com>

Hello All,

I'm currently using the Contour filter on a 2D slice. This contour gives 
me a series of closed loops at arbitrary locations of my plot. Does 
Paraview/VTK already expose a way to group the points associated with 
each of these closed loops?

If not, I have two possible strategies to detect these points:

1. I think the contour filter outputs the points of each closed loops in 
sequential order in the point array. I could compare the geometric 
distance between two sequential points in the array and detect a "large 
jump" followed by a "large decrease" to detect the transition from one 
loop to the next.

2. I could employ some sort of cluster finding algorithm, although I'm 
not sure which one as I do not know how many of these loops are and 
likely need something that optimizes for boundaries as opposed to centroids.

Are these ideas sane if PV doesn't already expose some functionalities 
that I do not know about?

Thanks,
Shuhao

I tried that page twice and get errors about missing fix-autobahn, and when
I removed that from the package.json, webpack complained about missing
eslint (I installed eslint, but it doesn't change), and then errors saying
"Webpack has been initialised using a configuration object that does not
match the API schema" and errors about the output directory needing to be
an "**absolute path** (required)". I'm sure there's something simple I'm
missing, but not sure what.

Thank you,

Hi Tom,

The documentation was written when we were still using Webpack 1 and
unfortunately it is outdated.
I'll try to update it so it will be easier to follow for users that don't
know any of those web tools.

For normalize, you can find some information directly on their web site
https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/

Hi Sebastien:

I suspected that and also tried downgrading to webpack 1, but then loading
paraviewweb won't work because lots of its dependencies require webpack
versions up to 2.2.0. (babel-loader, expose-loader, schema-utils,
worker-loader, several others) It tells you to load the peer dependencies
by hand, but that seems not to work for paraviewweb, though I'm probably
misunderstanding something.

I will forget the examples and try building up a webpack from scratch, but
there are a few things in the webpack config that make me nervous about the
prospects:

 1. The alias PVWStyle.

 2. The "postcss: [require('autoprefixer')... ]

 3. 'loader: "expose?MyWebApp"'.

All of these seem like maybe they are going to be required for some parts
of paraviewweb. The current version of webpack seems to choke on them all,
and I won't know what to replace them with. Any advice?

Thank you.

 -Tom

Hi Elyas,

OK, I took a deeper look, and consulted with Ken Moreland.  We think what you are trying to do can't be done, or if it can, it is very inefficient.  There are two filters of interest, the Rotational Extrude filter and the Angular Periodic filter.  

The Rotational Extrude filter takes a 2d object and rotates it in space, creating a disk or cylinder.  It must be polygonal data.  You can create polygonal data with the extract surface filter.  The Rotational Extrude filter will rotate your 2d object on the z axis.  If you want to rotate on a different axis, use the Transform filter to rotate your data to be lined up with the Z axis.  But, here is the kicker.  The output of the Rotational Extrude filter is a 2d surface,  In other words, this filter's output is hollow.  It will look good if you don't clip or slice it.  You can see that it is hollow with a slice filter.

The Angular Periodic filter will also rotate objects (i.e., pie slices) around an axis.  However, it won't fill it in if your data was originally 2d.  If it is pie slices, you will get a nice cylinder.  But, with your data, you will just see a lot of 2d planes, rooted at the center of a cylinder, and fanning out to form this sparse cylinder.  I tried the Delauny3d filter, and it hung.  

Ken's advice if this is necessary is to write a custom filter. 

Sorry I couldn't help more,

Alan

        Thanks. It worked. Now the filter is active. However, I am not sure what normal and origin coordinate I should put for the Slice filter to end up with a 3D cylinder rotated about y axis.

        Just a guess - this filter requires 2d polygonal data.  What I just did was Wavelet, then Slice.  Maybe your data is actually 3d?  Try running a slice filter on it first?
    
        Mind moving this to the paraview at paraview.org e-mail list, so everyone can see the answer?

Hi Shuhao,

In ParaView, the connectivity filter is available to assign a region
id to each of closed loops and generate a RegionId array. And then the
threshold filter can be used to separate them.

Thanks

Subject: [Paraview] Integrate Variables divide cell data by volume has no
 effect?
Message-ID: <908680c6-da64-da64-b229-c19e93c116e0@shuhaowu.com>

Hello all,

I've been using the filter IntegrateVariables with the option 
DivideCellDataByVolume = on on a 2D surface. I've noticed that turning 
this option on and off has no effect on the PointData of the output. No 
additional cell data is produced either.

I thought the idea of the the integrate variables filter is (for 2D): it 
sums up the values at each point and multiplied by the area associated 
with that point (*). If the DivideCellDataByVolume option is on, it will 
divide the final result by the total area. If this is the case, why does 
the option do nothing, shouldn't the point data be scaled by a constant 
factor that's the area?

(*) how does it associate the points with their areas?

Thanks,
Shuhao

The DivideCellDataByVolume only operates on cell data and you're
integrating a point data array so it won't work the way you're expecting it
to. You can use the point data to cell data filter and then try using the
integrate variable filter to see if that gives the result that you want.

I suspected so as well but didn't know how to convert the point data to 
cell data until now.

So does that mean integrate variables with point data will not be 
integration weighted by the area?

Thanks,
Shuhao

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview programmatically plot quantities over line,
 using only data on nodes
Message-ID: <CAMR3bkZdOSkz37-d-AGOoX__YpJ9Mtbe6QeugkiV8hKz9PDicQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I have a dataset on a 2D domain. I mean to get an XY plot of data along a
line which contains a number of element edges. I would typically do this
with PlotOverLine.

Now I want to obtain a similar plot, but with my data points located only
at the actual locations of nodes in my mesh. In this way, my XY plot (and
its underlying data) would be directly representative of the mesh
resolution in my original data.

*How can this be done programmatically, 1) from the UI as a macro, 2) from
the UI at the python shell, 3) at the CLI (pvpython myscript.py)?*

I couldn't even find how to do this via GUI. I started by *Select Points On*,
but I couldn't go any further. Moreover, if this is the right way to start,
I wouldn't be able to transfer it to python code, since *Start Trace* does
not include *Select Points On* in the output trace, so I wouldn't know how
to add it to code.
Thanks!

Subject: [Paraview] New variable to a mesh
Message-ID: <CAMCXd9=NioWqX1nxNAP9i7audUb4sxjo9M97XY21mJnRvMuE3g@mail.gmail.com>

 Greetings!

I am new to ParaView and have few queries regarding the assigning of a new
variable in mesh:

1: I am using calculator filter to add a new array. Is it possible to
interpolate the values in this array and also is it possible to generate
random numbers? (say if I want values between 0 to 1 in my array of 2000
cells)

2: Is there any other method by which I could assign properties to the
mesh? (say I want to assign different values to my cell - say hydraulic
conductivities in inhomogeneous porous medium) How can I do this with
calculator filter or with any other tool?

I am sorry if the questions are naive.
Looking forward to your response.

Regards

Moulshree Tripathi

Hi Tom,

Try to stay with the latest webpack. The setup doc was initially describing
the ParaViewWeb config itself.
But since we've updated the build process of ParaViewWeb, you could look at
the actual configuration of ParaViewWeb itself. That will give you the
proper set of files.

https://github.com/Kitware/paraviewweb/blob/master/webpack.config.js
https://github.com/Kitware/paraviewweb/blob/master/prettier.config.js
https://github.com/Kitware/paraviewweb/blob/master/package.json
https://github.com/Kitware/paraviewweb/blob/master/.eslintrc.js
https://github.com/Kitware/paraviewweb/blob/master/.babelrc

Hope that helps until we fix and update the documentation,

Seb

Yes, my excursion to webpack 1 was enough of a failure that I'm not tempted.

Thank you for that, I'll see if I can get something out of those.

Hi Tom,

I've just updated ParaViewWeb documentation (setup) to reflect the latest
tools that we use.
Also I've updated the examples to use absolute path so you would not need
to figure out those relative path resolution.

Travis is currently building the new version along with an updated website
which usually take around 25 minutes to complete.

Cool, thank you. I found some additional dependencies (hammerjs and
monologue.js) and added this loader to the webpack config for the
font-awesome thing:

      {
        test: /\.(eot|svg|ttf|woff|woff2)$/,
        loader: 'file-loader?name=public/fonts/[name].[ext]'
      }

Not sure if that's optimal, but it seems to work. My package dependencies
look like this now:

 "dependencies": {
    "font-awesome": "^4.7.0",
    "kw-web-suite": "^5.0.0",
    "monologue.js": "^0.3.5",
    "normalize.css": "^8.0.0",
    "paraviewweb": "^3.0.9",
    "react": "^15.5.4",
    "react-dom": "^15.5.4",
    "wslink": "^0.1.5",
    "hammerjs": "^2.0.8"
  },

Happy to hear if I've gotten something wrong. Looking forward to the new
site.

Thank you,

 -Tom

Hi Tom,

So everything is up, so you can checkout the website.

Regarding your loader, I think it is good. You can look the ones we use
here:
https://github.com/Kitware/paraviewweb/tree/master/config

And for the dependency, we let the user to add every dependency required
instead of forcing a specific version in our pvw dependency list. That way
they can update or pick version at their own discretion.
Especially if a dependency is missing the error message is pretty explicit
regarding which one needs to be added.

Seb

I'd suggest trying the nightly binaries (or wait for 5.5 release
candidates which should come out in the next week or so). A new **Plot
Data Over Time** filer will let you do this without have to worry
about selecting cells/points etc.

What is the difference between this new **Plot Data Over Time** and
existing **Plot ____ Over Time**?

I wonder how this accommodates what I mean to achieve, which is more like
Plot Data Over Path (or Node Set).

PS: My objective resembles the procedure in Abaqus whereby one defines a
Path based on an arbitrary sequence of points (which can be nodes, e.g.)
and then plots a given quantity along that path.

Subject: [Paraview] Create filter with jump in fields
Message-ID: <CAMR3bkagAU185qqfkn_RugM=2YM57pPAHgVxCa-HL7q2oVjm+A@mail.gmail.com>

I have a dataset with discontinuous displacements across a few surfaces (so
far I am working in 2D, so these would be lines, 1D). It is input as a
PVDReader (just in case it makes any difference here, which I doubt).

*Is there any way to programmatically create a new Source with the
displacement jumps along those lines? Note that this new field would
probably have to be defined on a domain with a lower dimension, see above.*

So far, I created filters PlotOverLine, on lines slightly below and
slightly above the prescribed line. But I do not know how to subtract the
two and place them in a single field over the line.

*Mathematical description of an example*:

Discontinuous field: u(x,y)

Domain of discontinuity: x axis, y=0

Value of the field on one side of the domain of discontinuity: u(x+,0)

Value of the field on the other side of the domain of discontinuity: u(x-,0)

Jump in the field: d(x) = u(x+,0) - u(x-,0)

The field u is defined on a 2D domain. The field d is defined on a 1D
domain (x axis).

Oops, I misunderstood. What you want, if I am not mistaken, is already
supported. Have you tried the "Plot Data" filter? It allows you to
plot cell data or point data directly. If you want a subset of points
from your original mesh, they try subsetting before applying the Plot
Data filter using something like clip or threshold.

Hi Moulshree,

The Programmable filter's script would be more flexible to add an
array rather than doing it in the calculator filter since it allows us
to use various NumPy modules.

Here is a simple example that generates a random numpy array and adds
it to the mesh as a vtk array.
----
import numpy as np

input = self.GetInput()
numCells = input.GetNumberOfCells()
np_rand = np.random.rand(numCells)
output.CellData.append(np_rand, "random")
----

Some information can be found here:
https://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Python_Programmable_Filter

Thanks

Hello Moulshree,

Using the function numpy.random.uniform(), you can define the range of
random numbers by the half-open interval [low, high):

  np_rand = np.random.uniform(0,100,numCells)

The details are as follows.
https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.random.uniform.html

And of course the conditional statements are available in Programmable
filter's script as is the case in normal python script.

Best

Subject: [Paraview] How to get filled slices of tubes and disks around
 streamlines
Message-ID: <CADNeF3ppnj=YSd-b3TDo69KC8CX4_7gp1eapmcSwzoYGeGsuMw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am tracing streamlines using "Stream Tracer with Custom Source" and
creating tubes along them using "Tubes". Since "Tubes" creates surfaces, if
I use "Slice" on the tubes I don't get elliptical disks but ellipses.

I would like to:
1) Visualize elliptical disks when using "Slice" on "Tubes".

I would be even better if, instead of getting the elliptical disks, which
are bounded by the cross section of the tubes, I could get circular disks
in the same position, i.e., if I could
2) represent circular disks on a plane that crosses the streamlines centred
on the intersections between the plane and the streamlines

Subject: [Paraview] How to get filled slices of tubes and disks around
 streamlines
Message-ID: <3625144ef16d4888a75f1334a528559b@ES08AMSNLNT.srn.sandia.gov>

Thomas,

I think a better approach to what you are doing is to use the Glyph filter on your streamlines instead of the Tubes filter. After you create your streamlines, perform the following steps.


  1.  With the stream tracer selected in the pipeline browser, add the glyph filter (it?s icon looks like a Christmas ornament).
  2.  Turn on the advanced properties in the properties panel.
  3.  In the Glyph Type combo box, select ?2D Glyph?.
  4.  Assuming you have the advanced properties on, you should see a second Glyph Type combo box appear under the first one. Select ?Circle? in this second box.
  5.  Click on Filled checkbox.
  6.  Under Active Attributes, make sure the Vectors property is set to the vector field you used to create the streamlines.
  7.  Scroll down to where it says Glyph Transform. Set the Rotate property to 0, 90, 0. (That is, change the middle number from 0 to 90.)
  8.  Click Apply.

You should now see filled circles perpendicular to the streamlines. You might need to change the Glyph filter?s Masking mode to either ?All Points? or ?Every Nth Point? to get the samples of circles how you want them.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [Paraview] How to get filled slices of tubes and disks around streamlines

Hi,
I am tracing streamlines using "Stream Tracer with Custom Source" and creating tubes along them using "Tubes". Since "Tubes" creates surfaces, if I use "Slice" on the tubes I don't get elliptical disks but ellipses.
I would like to:
1) Visualize elliptical disks when using "Slice" on "Tubes".

I would be even better if, instead of getting the elliptical disks, which are bounded by the cross section of the tubes, I could get circular disks in the same position, i.e., if I could
2) represent circular disks on a plane that crosses the streamlines centred on the intersections between the plane and the streamlines

Would you see a way of doing that or getting the same visual result?
Thank you,
Thomas Oliveira

Subject: [Paraview] connecting buttons and python
Message-ID: <CABrYh3oB8XDBVpfWxzx8dTHpNqzjXCgiv-Cm_TgeTTFiYg+QZw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all:

Got some nice looking buttons and widgets, but I can't seem to find
examples of how to deliver the button press or other widget output to my
pvpython server. I imagine the steps are:

1. Create a protocol on the python side. Can I use wslink.register, or is
there paraviewweb functionality I should be using?

2. Create a matching protocol on the js side, with
ParaviewWebClient.createClient(), but I'm not seeing how to link the
protocol to a function that can be linked to a button press.

Also, this page, found via a google search, seems potentially useful, but
gives me a 404.

https://kitware.github.io/paraviewweb/api/ParaViewWebClient.html

Many thanks,

 -Tom

Yes that link is old and broken, but if you navigate through the api docs
links, that is working.  Here's the direct link to the page you couldn't
find though:

Thank you that's very helpful. Where will I find how to define the
protocols on the python side? I've only found a wslink example that looks
like this:

from wslink import register as exportRPC
from wslink.websocket import LinkProtocol

class myProtocol(LinkProtocol):
    def __init__(self):
        super(myProtocol, self).__init__()

    @exportRPC("myprotocol.testButton")
    def testButton(self, nothing):
        print("******* HELP ********")

Pvpython isn't happy with this, but I'm not sure where to look for the
right way to do it.

Thank you,

 -Tom

That actually looks ok to me.  Why isn't pvpython happy with it?  What
version of ParaView are you running?  If it's a recent ParaView and the
problem is you can't import wslink, then setting up a virtualenv with the
missing modules (wslink and its dependencies) might be what you need.  See
this blog post for more information on how to use pvpython but also bring
in the modules in your virtualenv:

https://blog.kitware.com/using-pvpython-and-virtualenv/

If the problem is something else, we might need more details.

Hope this helps.

Cheers,
Scott

Turns out you can't use capital letters for the protocol options (what
should I call them?), according to the discussion at this link. Some people
here might find it familiar:

There appears to be one more missing piece, though, because my attempt
provokes an assertion error that appears to be claiming that my protocol,
derived from a LinkProtocol, is not actually a LinkProtocol:

  File "pvsvn.py", line 41, in initialize

    self.registerVtkWebProtocol(self.testbutton())

  File
"/Applications/ParaView-5.4.1-1232-g1496380e37.app/Contents/Python/vtkmodules/web/wslink.py",
line 63, in registerVtkWebProtocol

    self.registerLinkProtocol(protocol)

  File
"/Applications/ParaView-5.4.1-1232-g1496380e37.app/Contents/Python/wslink/websocket.py",
line 89, in registerLinkProtocol

    assert( isinstance(protocol, LinkProtocol))

AssertionError

At least I think that's what it's saying.

Thank you,

 -Tom

Subject: [Paraview] how to make a new protocol
Message-ID: <CABrYh3oC1a_C1tzzkQwa_efyjyK+hEnir8jY+4dhy=yoECjdOg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all:

Can someone describe the steps necessary to create and use a web socket
connection between a Paraviewweb client and a pvpython server? I am not
having much luck finding the documentation for registerVtkWebProtocol()
which appears to be an important part of the process. Google only helps me
find pvw-visualizer.py, which I'm sure is useful code, but I'm having a
hard time making much sense of it as an example.

I would appreciate even just being pointed to the vtk python code, but I'll
take any pointers you can offer.

Thank you,

 -Tom

Dear all,

I have time series data in multiple vtu files. When I export data as (save data) csv file I get one csv file per time frame. Is it possible to export this data in single csv file which would contain one column with time information?

Thank you

Hassan,

If you are interested in learning how to use ParaView for post processing, I recommend starting with the ParaView Tutorial (https://www.paraview.org/Wiki/The_ParaView_Tutorial). The tutorial does not talk about SU2 specifically, but it teaches basic techniques for visualization, including from CFD simulations.

SU2 can write out .vtk files, which ParaView can read. After learning the basics and you have more specific questions, we can help you with that.

LightViz will be a good example as it defines a custom set of protocols
instead of using only the default ones like in Visualizer.

If you are interested in learning how to use ParaView for post processing, I recommend starting with the ParaView Tutorial (https://www.paraview.org/Wiki/The_ParaView_Tutorial). The tutorial does not talk about SU2 specifically, but it teaches basic techniques for visualization, including from CFD simulations.

SU2 can write out .vtk files, which ParaView can read. After learning the basics and you have more specific questions, we can help you with that.

Subject: [Paraview] How to represent many glyphs colored by SeedIds per
 streamline?
Message-ID: <CADNeF3p20OB8+VqBmZUszneJzatt9e2tHddjo_cxRUfOFU3Bmw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am visualizing disks perpendicular to streamlines by performing the
following steps, which works.
    1) Create a Plane
    2) Create a Stream Tracer with Custom Source using the plane
    3) With the stream tracer selected in the pipeline browser, add the
glyph filter
    4) In the Glyph Type combo box, select ?2D Glyph?.
    5) Select ?Circle? in the second Glyph Type combo box
    6) Click on Filled checkbox.
    5) Under Active Attributes, make sure the Vectors property is set to
the vector field I used to create the streamlines.
    6) Set the Glyph Transform Rotate property to 0, 90, 0.

On each streamline, many disks are rendered.

However, if, in Glyph Properties > Active Attributes > Scalars, I select
SeedIds, I see just one disk per streamline. Would it be possible to have
many disks per streamline colored by SeedIds?

My final goal is to illustrate at the outlet face of my model the starting
position the streamlines that cross it. To do I am trying to render disks
colored by SeedIds near the inlet and outlet faces, so that pair of disks
of a same color represents two points connected by a streamline. Any other
idea that provides a similar visual result is also welcome.


Best regards,
Thomas Oliveira

Subject: [Paraview] Memory leaks in Catalyst ?
References: <991103582.7080573.1519334890313.JavaMail.root@zimbra10-e2>
Message-ID: <1519336426.19876.0.camel@free.fr>

Hello,

Running under Valgrind (memcheck, with --enable-leak-check=full), I have some
warnings about ParaView/Catalyst possibly leaking memory.

Catalyst is called from Code_Saturne, whose adapter code (using ParaView Python
adapters from C++) is here https://www.code-saturne.org/viewvc/saturne/trunk/src
/fvm/fvm_to_catalyst.cxx?revision=11048&view=markup, using the attached
results.py script.

I fixed a leak in my own code following the Valgrind warnings, but some remining
warnings seem related to calls I have no direct control over, so I attach a log
(on one MPI rank) of Valgrind warnings (edited to remove OpenMPI initialization
related warnings). The first part contains memcheck warnings, the part after
"HEAP SUMMARY" the memory leak info.

I'm not sure if the leaks are "one time only" (not too much of an issue), or can
occur at every output timestep (30 in this example, for a small case with about
8000 mesh elements per MPI rank), so any opinion / checking on that would be
welcome.

Best regards,

  Yvan Fournier

Good evening Paraview-Help
I tried to run the script in Paraview guide chapter fourteen (Teaser) page 175 I used first source sphere then the filter elevation and then programmable filter and then I paste the script bellow in script part:
from vtk. numpy_interface import dataset_adapter as dsa
from vtk. numpy_interface import algorithms as algs
data = inputs [0]
print data.PointData.keys ()
print data.PointData[?Elevation ?]
and the rest left default as it was .after hitting run it suppose to get a table as was said in the guide but I got the below error :
File "<string>", line 6
print data.PointData[?Elevation ?]
^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "<string>", line 22, in <module>
NameError: name 'RequestData' is not defined
Then I tried to change the output type to different types (vtktable,vtkpolydata,?etc) and I got different errors.
Below attached images contain info. About the version of ParaView and the pipeline scheme (format png).
Any help or advice  will be greatly appreciated .

Kind Regards.

Mohammed,

There is a bug in this filter that requires you to set the output data type
to the desired type to vtkTable before the first time you click Apply.
Changing it after clicking Apply currently doesn't work.

See if that works around the problem.

Thanks,
Cory

Hi Yvan,

The vtkPKdTree ones look like they could be after looking at the code,
especially vtkPKdTree::InitializeRegionAssignmentLists(). It seems like a
good idea to replace the int **ProcessAssignmentMap with maybe a
std::vector. Probably a good idea for the other member variables here as
well. I'll spend some time refactoring vtkPKdTree to make sure that the
memory management is leak free.

I don't see anything that suspicious with respect to ParaView in the other
leak reports, though that doesn't necessarily mean that they aren't leaks.

Cheers,
Andy

Hi Andy,
Thanks for checking.  Fixing my own bug (by adding vtkSmartPointer where needed
in ly adaptor) fixed what seemed the larges issue on a small test case. A
colleague is testing this on a larger case (for a real application) and should
provide me some feedback on a larger, long-running case.
He also observed some artifacts using transparency on a boundary/surface mesh
(not fixed by using -DDEFAULT_SOFTWARE_DEPTH_BITS=31 in Mesa's CFLAGS and
CPPFLAGS, but remind me of issues I had observed on ParaView 5.0 and which had
been fixed in 5.0.1) using llvmpipe. OpenSWR seemed to lead to crashes. I'll
start by testing this on one of my simpler (non-confidential) benchmark cases.
So I'll probably be running a series of additional tests (to update a series
from 2 years ago) and keep you informed if I encounter any issues (and possibly
send a few non-confidential screenshots if everything is working well).
Cheers,
	Yvan

Hi Yvan,

I have a merge request into VTK at
https://gitlab.kitware.com/vtk/vtk/merge_requests/3971 that hopefully
improves the memory use. I still have 2 tests that are failing and also
want to test with the ParaView tests so there's a bit more work to do. For
the most part it seems ok though so if you want to try taking those change
and test it on your end I wouldn't mind some extra testing on it,
especially since we're getting so close to the ParaView 5.5 release.

Best,
Andy

Subject: [Paraview] extract specific time steps from unstructured grid
 timeseries using paraview
Message-ID: <DEA101B66315B941B487EAE03CFFF4435170E3D8@V-EXC-C02.DIRECTORY.INTRA>

Hello,

I have scalar data in a time series of unstructured grid datasets. I'd like to extract this data for specific timesteps. I tried the following but only seem to get the information for the very first time step:


AllFiles = ['File001.vtk', 'File002.vtk', 'File003.vtk', 'File004.vtk']
Reader = LegacyVTKReader(FileNames = AllFiles)
Reader = ExtractTimeSteps(Reader,1)

Output = servermanager.Fetch(Reader)
Results = vtk_to_numpy(Output.GetPointData().GetScalars('inc remental_deviatoric_strain_solid'))

I also tried:

Reader = ExtractTimeSteps(Reader,1)

But it throws an error:

Reader = ExtractTimeSteps(Reader,1)
File "C:\Program Files\ParaView 5.2.0-Qt4-OpenGL2-Windows-64bit\bin\Lib\site-packages\paraview\simple.py", line 1674, in CreateObject
raise RuntimeError ("Expecting a proxy as input.")
RuntimeError: Expecting a proxy as input.

How can I pick the time step for which I want the data? Also is it possible to specify a range of time steps?

I'd suggest using the trace functionality to figure out how to set
parameters on filter of interest.

In this case, to exact timestep 1 using ExtractTimeSteps filter, the
correct approach is as follows:

extractTimeSteps1 = ExtractTimeSteps(Input=Reader)
extractTimeSteps1.TimeStepIndices = [1]

OR

extractTimeSteps1 = ExtractTimeSteps(Input=Reader, TimeStepIndices = [1])

Subject: [Paraview] information_only property doesn't update, please help
Message-ID: <CAO_imTtJzYvRSg8zUsrqJrb4SAyNpw44s1PcVjBG+cB44S2pPA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello VTK developers,
several questions about the correct usage of information_only properties
have been asked over the years, but I didn't find a working solution.

The attached example is a complete, tiny, source plugin ("MyInfoSource")
for paraview 5.4.1. It generates an empty PolyData output. I am only
interested in modifying and showing the source's properties.

MyInfoSource has 3 properties (cf. InfoSource.xml):
1) InputPoint allows to input three coordinates.
2) CalculatedPoint has 'information_only="1"' and will be calculated
whenever InputPoint is set.
3) ShowCalculatedPoint has 'information_property="CalculatedPoint"' and is
meant to output that calculated value.

I am using a modified vtkInfoSource::SetInputPoint, which sets the
CalculatedPoint coordinates to twice the InputPoint coordinates whenever
InputPoint changes (cf. vtkInfoSource.cxx).

I was expecting the "ShowCalculatedPoint" property to update in the
properties view, whenever I apply changes to InputPoint, but it doesn't
change. Only when I click "Restore application default setting values" for
MyInformationSource, then ShowCalculatedPoint shows twice the last value of
InputPoint.

Can you reproduce this behaviour?
What needs to be changed, so that ShowCalculatedPoint always shows twice
the InputPoint coordinates after changes are applied?

Many thanks,
Jussuf

Hi Utkarsh, 

I missed this and just saw your GitLab comment. To answer your first question, I was on Linux, saving as PNG. But, you're correct, my issue was that ffmpeg accepts two -r flags, one for the input and one for the output and what I needed to do was set -r 1  and -r 30, respectively. 

Thanks,
Mark

Mark,

As  I was re-reading your email while working on issue #1792 [1] which affects the save animation dialog, I have a few questions: Are you saving the movie as AVI (and on what platform). If so doesn't changing "Frame Rate" have the same effect for avi? If you set your frame rate to 1 frame/second, doesn't that yeild exactly what you're looking for
-- each frame stays on for 1s with discrete jumps and no interpolation? Atleast on linux/mac where the FFMPEG writer is used, I can see that the frame rate of 1 fps works as expected. What am I missing?

Thanks,
Utkarsh

Message-ID: <906053129.13151467.1519670833367.JavaMail.root@zimbra10-e2>

Hello Andy,

Here is a log (edited to remove unrelated OpenMPI Valgrind warnings) using the patch from your merge request.

It seems the first 2 warnings (related to the kd-tree) have disappeared. The rest is unchanged.

I also just ran a test regarding transparency issues a colleague reported. I did not reproduce issues running on 224 MPI ranks with a relatively simple test case (a tube bundle with only 4 tubes), which is the same test case I have been using for some time. So there seem to be issues in more complex geometries, but no apparent regression relative to PV 5.0.1). I'll need to find a more complex yet non-confidential test case for that issue, so I'll keep you updated when I can...

The same user ran 3 days over the week-end (several hundred time steps) on that complex mesh, using point sprites, with no crash, so the memory leaks don't seem as bad as they used to be (the biggest leak was on my side, where the mesh was missing smart pointers...). I haven't seen his images yet (reportedly mostly working well but with some transparency parallel compositing issues, whether using a transparent boundary or point sprites).

Best regards,

  Yvan

Hi Yvan, 

I have a merge request into VTK at https://gitlab.kitware.com/vtk/vtk/merge_requests/3971 that hopefully improves the memory use. I still have 2 tests that are failing and also want to test with the ParaView tests so there's a bit more work to do. For the most part it seems ok though so if you want to try taking those change and test it on your end I wouldn't mind some extra testing on it, especially since we're getting so close to the ParaView 5.5 release. 

Best, 
Andy

Hi Andy, 


Thanks for checking. Fixing my own bug (by adding vtkSmartPointer where needed in ly adaptor) fixed what seemed the larges issue on a small test case. A colleague is testing this on a larger case (for a real application) and should provide me some feedback on a larger, long-running case. 


He also observed some artifacts using transparency on a boundary/surface mesh (not fixed by using -DDEFAULT_SOFTWARE_DEPTH_BITS=31 in Mesa's CFLAGS and CPPFLAGS, but remind me of issues I had observed on ParaView 5.0 and which had been fixed in 5.0.1) using llvmpipe. OpenSWR seemed to lead to crashes. I'll start by testing this on one of my simpler (non-confidential) benchmark cases. 


So I'll probably be running a series of additional tests (to update a series from 2 years ago) and keep you informed if I encounter any issues (and possibly send a few non-confidential screenshots if everything is working well). 


Cheers, 


Yvan

Hi Yvan, 

The vtkPKdTree ones look like they could be after looking at the code, especially vtkPKdTree::InitializeRegionAssignmentLists(). It seems like a good idea to replace the int **ProcessAssignmentMap with maybe a std::vector. Probably a good idea for the other member variables here as well. I'll spend some time refactoring vtkPKdTree to make sure that the memory management is leak free. 

I don't see anything that suspicious with respect to ParaView in the other leak reports, though that doesn't necessarily mean that they aren't leaks. 

Cheers, 
Andy

Hello, 

Running under Valgrind (memcheck, with --enable-leak-check=full), I have some 
warnings about ParaView/Catalyst possibly leaking memory. 

Catalyst is called from Code_Saturne, whose adapter code (using ParaView Python 
adapters from C++) is here https://www.code-saturne.org/viewvc/saturne/trunk/src 
/fvm/fvm_to_catalyst.cxx?revision=11048&view=markup , using the attached 
results.py script. 

I fixed a leak in my own code following the Valgrind warnings, but some remining 
warnings seem related to calls I have no direct control over, so I attach a log 
(on one MPI rank) of Valgrind warnings (edited to remove OpenMPI initialization 
related warnings). The first part contains memcheck warnings, the part after 
"HEAP SUMMARY" the memory leak info. 

I'm not sure if the leaks are "one time only" (not too much of an issue), or can 
occur at every output timestep (30 in this example, for a small case with about 
8000 mesh elements per MPI rank), so any opinion / checking on that would be 
welcome. 

Best regards, 

Yvan Fournier

Thanks for testing and reporting back!

I'll see if I can motivate someone else to look at the other memory leaks
since I'm not as familiar with that code.

FYI: the vtkPKdTree changes are now in VTK master and will likely make it
into PV 5.5.

Best,
Andy

Hi Bastien,


I tried your script, but the recordingTimeInMilliseconds takes
waiting time ?before' data logging.
I want to set data logging time (begin to end).

Subject: [Paraview] Detect Catalyst extraction from within a coprocessor
Message-ID: <61766c48079ffcd05dacf01f9d006a20@fau.de>

Hi,

is there any way that the coprocessor can detect if the catalyst user 
clicks on the extract icon? Something like a function that sleeps until 
a new coprocess steps needs to be done.
Or do I have to continuously poll the catalyst client if it needs a new 
batch of data transmitted?

Simon

Hi Simon,

Currently there's nothing that allows the coprocessor to get information
that the user has clicked on the extract icon during a Catalyst Live
connection. You may be able to hack in a solution though by looking at
either vtkLiveInSituLink (
https://www.paraview.org/ParaView/Doc/Nightly/www/cxx-doc/classvtkLiveInsituLink.html)
or coprocessing.py.

By the way, I'm curious about the use case for this -- what functionality
are you hoping to do with this information? FYI: we're hoping to add
significant functionality in the near future for Catalyst Live so something
like that may be supported in the near future.

Best,
Andy

Subject: [Paraview] Detect Catalyst extraction from within a coprocessor

Hi Andy,

our optimization software is able to stream live results via http when 
configured. This stream is pointed at a continuous running webservice 
that saves the current progress. A user can for example view the current 
scalar variables over the steps to make sure the problem converges: 
http://eamc075.eam.uni-erlangen.de
Simple 2D data should also be viewable at some point.
Now comes catalyst:
The webservice should also be able to redirect the data to a catalyst 
instance. A user can enter the ip and port online and will receive the 
data from the webservice onto his local machine. The data is in general 
not bulky so I can send all data to the client and do the processing on 
the machine running paraview/catalyst.

This means that the client catalyst will never directly connect to the 
simulation or vice versa in our use case.

Regards,
Simon

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview starts to lag extremely after adding too much
 complexity in the pipeline
Message-ID: <DM5PR1501MB2023BC497F1FC8964EC9A6A9FDC00@DM5PR1501MB2023.namprd15.prod.outlook.com>

Hi all,

We use a fairly complex pipeline with more than 300 filters.

When divided across 20 .pvsm , everything is fast. We started to merge those .pvsm into a single one.

For the first 17 .pvsm everything was still fast. No .pvsm load time and no lag.

Once we started integrating the 18th .pvsm the performance started to degrade. We used VTune to diagnose paraview:
Seems that the performance drop is purely related to vtkInformation::GetAsObjectBase and  vtkDemandDrivenPipeline::ComputePipelineMTime which is call recursively  37 times in a single call stack sample !

It makes no difference if we integrate the 20 small .pvsm into a single large .pvsm or if we integrate thoses .pvsm as custom filters (.cpd) in the main .pvsm.

This is true when we are loading the .pvsm, but this is also true when we are modifying values in the statefile.

We are using:
Win10
Paraview 5.3 derivative.
Memory consumption is 1Go on a 16 Go machine.

Any idea on how to improve the performance ? We though about dividing the pipeline into a multitude of pvserver...

Hello,

The script toggles the recording state after the desired waiting time.
Hence:
If you launch it from non-recording state, it will start recording
after recordingTimeInMilliseconds.
If you launch it from recording state, it will stop recording after
recordingTimeInMilliseconds.

Message-ID: <9426e83d265f8fe564203e21a5f4b4d8@fau.de>

Hi,

I am trying to build the latest paraview using paraview-superbuild (I 
set the branch config to "release"). I need catalyst python wrappings 
and I am using system python (3.4). I get the following error:

CMake Error at VTK/Wrapping/Python/cmake_install.cmake:5822 (file):
   file INSTALL cannot find
   "[...]/superbuild/paraview/build/lib/python3.4/site-packages/vtk.pyc".
Call Stack (most recent call first):
   VTK/cmake_install.cmake:260 (include)
   cmake_install.cmake:118 (include)

the .pyc and .pyo file are located here:
[...]/superbuild/paraview/build/lib/python3.4/site-packages/__pycache__/vtk.cpython-34.pyc
[...]/superbuild/paraview/build/lib/python3.4/site-packages/__pycache__/vtk.cpython-34.pyo

I tried editing the .cmake files to fix this, which didn't work. I guess 
they are being re-generated each time I run "make" :(

Simon

Jonathan,

Do you think this is related to the same issue or something else?

https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/issues/17957

Is there a sample state file that you can share?

Hi Utkarsh,

At first I though so, then we converted all our small statefiles to .cpd and used those custom filters into a "master" statefile. The result was much less "GeometryRepresentation". It did reduce the loading time by minutes but the bulk of the loading time was still there. At that moment we decided to profile the load state mechanism with Vtune and the vtkDemandDrivenPipeline::ComputePipelineMTime was definitely the culprit (99.6% of cputime). 

This scenario might be related to  :
https://public.kitware.com/pipermail/vtkusers/2013-November/082003.html

After searching more, I think we simply reached the VTK limit in terms of Demand-Driven Pipeline. I understand that a Demand-Driven pipeline is perfect with low pipeline complexity, expansive computation where we want to maximize interactivity. But for complex pipeline with fast algorithms an Event-Driven pipeline might be better. However in our case, we have a complex pipeline, that we want to be as interactive as possible while having expansive computation. So we need an hybrid of the two type of pipelines.

I know we could convert all our smaller pipelines to filters, and reduce the overall pipeline complexity. However, at the speed we are making changes and prototyping, using the interface of ParaView to create our pipeline is our goal. I have two solutions: 

1 - A way to keep the flexibility and prototyping capability while having complex subset of filters could be to use programmable filters. However the inexistent error passing of a programmable filter makes it impossible to use in a production context. This issue would help in solving our problem: https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/issues/17591 

2 - A good way might be to keep the main statefile as a Demand-Driven Pipeline, while having smaller subset execute as Event-Driven Pipeline. The way to define those subset could be by using .cpd file. 

For #2, I have an implementation in mind, which might be difficult to implement (and a bit crazy too) : create a pvserver for each custom filter that is instantiate in the pipeline.  This way, I keep the interactivity of all 3dwidget in the .cpd while keeping all filters contains in the .cpd outside of the main pipeline. The main pipeline stays a fast and interactive Demand-Driven pipeline while .cpd behave like small Event-Driven pipeline.   This mechanics would be handle by the custom filter itself and would act as a wrapper to a external pvserver. For passing the information between the main pipeline and slaves pvserver, I though about Catalyst. 

Of course, any simpler way to tell Paraview to handle a custom filter as an event-driven pipeline is welcome.

Best regards,

Jonathan Borduas

Jonathan,

Do you think this is related to the same issue or something else?

https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/issues/17957

Is there a sample state file that you can share?

Subject: [Paraview] Grid Axes question
Message-ID: <68DBE245-75BC-4667-80EF-5B59747FCFD2@voxaya.com>

Hi all,

I?m using Paraview 5.4.1 on MacOS andI would like to display the physical dimensions of an image using the grid axes.

Using a 3D (3x3x3) image (.mhd) with a voxel size of 1mm^3, all the grid axes are going from 0 up to 2 ...

Any option to make them go up to 3 ?

Tnx.

-Thierry

Ah, I was wrong in my earlier response. The problem is that the single
quotation marks are copied from the ParaView Guide as apostrophes (or
"smart" single quotes). Change these to single quotes ( ' ) in your script
and it will run fine.

HTH,
Cory
