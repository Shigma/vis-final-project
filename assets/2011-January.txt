Subject: [Paraview] How to add plug-in's parameters to ParaView state file
Message-ID: <AANLkTik+C5H9Rf0fnVEBWnuvcRGt9E-K6gB7TNm8S1Md@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

I have developed exporter plug-in for ParaView with 50+ input
parameters. At the moment, I'm setting parameters from dialog I start
on menu action and preserve their values between ParaView sessions by
using QSettings object. Is it possible to save these values in
ParaView state files without changing ParaView main sources?

Thanks,
Nenad.

Every time SaveState is called in the ParaView GUI, pqApplicationCore
singleton fires a signal "stateSaved(vtkPVXMLElement*)". Your code can
handle this signal to add new child XML elements to the root.
Similarly, there's a stateLoadeded(...) signal that gets fired that
you can handle to load the custom elements from the state xml.

I have not tried this from a plug in, but I can't think of any reason why it would not work:

#include "pqApplicationCore.h"
#include "pqSettings.h"

...

pqSettings *settings = pqApplicationCore::instance()->settings();

pqSettings is a subclass of QSettings (it adds a few methods for saving and restoring the positions of windows).  The one returned by the pqApplicationCore singleton instance will point to ParaView's settings file.

Hi,

I have seen thaht we can select  cells or points but not cells and points (or 
points and cell) and have them display in Paraview GUI.
So, I would like to know if it is possible to have selected cells and points at 
the same time in paraview ?

Thanks !

Thank You very much on Your suggestion. It works perfectly. Is there
also some easy solution when working with pvpython and pvbatch clients
or I should add Python parsing code to servermanager.py
(servermanager::LoadState())?

Thanks,

Nenad,

The signals that pqApplication core fires are actually forwarded from
vtk-events fired by the proxy manager (look at
pqApplicationCore::onStateSaved/onStateLoaded). So you can add an
observer to those events on the proxy manager from Python and handle
them. However, you cannot really processes the arguments passed to
when the event  is fired in Python. One workaround would be to create
a vtk-class that does the event handling and simply instantiate and
initialize it in Python.

Dear Eric,

Your first suggestion sounds like the way to go. I call it suggestion
instead of question because I am not actually printing the connectivity
info, I was just wondering what would be the best way for printing that
info. It is relatively easy for me to write the "lines" that join the
centers, and, by using the tube filter, to rescale them. I will let you know
the advances here. I would like also to color the tubes by some other info,
like the strength of the contacts. I will explore the possibilities. I am
sorry in advance if my questions are so simple, I am a newbie for Paraview
and I am trying to avoid asking silly questions =).

As soon as I have the files with the line-connectivity info inside them, I
will post one of them here.

Thanks again for the help.

Best regards / Cordialmente,

Message-ID: <AANLkTimUs00TZ9_6thFsBsZyQGqpHKsNm5E_DnMt9TXD@mail.gmail.com>

hi all,

we have run into a problem reading a pretty large (3.6 GB) .vtu file.
the file was produced by a fortran program that writes vtk data in the
old ascii format which results in a 17G ascii file which takes very
long to load in paraview (and results in an error message). so, we
have written a converter program that reads the ascii file and outputs
xml:


int main(int argc, char *argp[])
{
  if (argc != 2) {
    cerr << "usage: " << argp[0] << " <vtk filename>\n\n";
    return 1;
  }

  char *filename = argp[1];

  cout << "Input filename: " << filename << "\n";

  vtkSmartPointer<vtkUnstructuredGridReader> reader =
vtkSmartPointer<vtkUnstructuredGridReader>::New();
  reader->SetFileName(filename);

  char *ofilename = "foo.vtu";
  cout << "Output filename: " << ofilename << "\n";
  vtkSmartPointer<vtkXMLUnstructuredGridWriter> writer =
vtkSmartPointer<vtkXMLUnstructuredGridWriter>::New();
  writer->SetFileName(ofilename);
  writer->SetInputConnection(reader->GetOutputPort());
  writer->Write();

  return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}

this program runs fine. now, if i open the resulting file in paraview,
i run into this error as soon as i hit apply:

ERROR: In /opt/paraview-3.8.1/src/ParaView-3.8.1/VTK/IO/vtkXMLUnstructuredDataReader.cxx,
line 652
vtkXMLUnstructuredGridReader (0x143f0c40): Cannot read cell
connectivity from Cells in piece 0 because the "connectivity" array is
not long enough.

the converter did work on a smaller test data set and paraview could
open it - only now with the large data set paraview fails. here is the
header of the failing file:

does anyone know what could be going on here? do we need to configure
paraview to handle larger files? is this a bug? could the original
ascii data set have been corrupt and the error reflects now in the xml
file?

Hi Guenter and all,

I also had the same issue with .vti (XML vtkImageData) files of
roughly the same sizes of around 3 GBytes. Currently I'm working
around the issue by building VTK and ParaView with VTK_USE_64BIT_IDS
set to ON, which will allow you to load up to 4 GBytes as compared to
2 GBytes when VTK_USE_64BIT_IDS is OFF.

However I'd be interested if there's more fundamental way of resolving
the issue because I'll be handling larger cases soon. Is there a
format (other than series of legacy VTK format files) that is
time-aware, parallelizable and allows more than 4 GBytes of
vtkImageData per partition?

Takuya,

thanks for your quick reply. however, we do have set

VTK_USE_64BIT_IDS                ON

and this is a 64bit linux platform (CentOS/RHEL x86_64) in case that
matters - so unfortunately that isn't the solution here.

thanks anyway and kind regards,

   guenter

Hi Guenter, just for confirmation, did you build both VTK that your
converter uses and ParaView with VTK_USE_64BIT_IDS ON?

By the way I'm working with OS X 10.6, if it makes difference...

yes - at least that's what i thought i did ;) . actually we have built
paraview 3.8.1 from source which came with a statically embedded
version of VTK. i have then built my converter against that VTK that
came with paraview.

i have blogged about my little converter program:

https://sites.google.com/site/guenterbartsch/blog/myfirstvtkprogram

so others may benefit from it - but i don't think i have any
additional information in my blog post.

thanks again for your help and best regards,

   guenter

Hi Utkarsh,

Thanks for your reply. Here are tow images that I made from ParaView and 
Google Earth.

Cheers!

Subject: [Paraview] tables in multi-block datasets
Message-ID: <AANLkTim2aTuXvNZUky2vQizJHVH_pAjF=c4_v9no+Q0y@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I would like to attach some tables of data to my multi-block dataset
(already containing volumes and surfaces) but many of the filters now cause
paraview to crash - i.e. cut, clip, extract threshold, etc.  The crash
happens because the filters do not check the SafeDownCast to a vtkDataSet.

Here is a Python script that reproduces this:

8<----------------------------------------------------
from paraview.simple import *
c = Cylinder()
h = Histogram()
g = GroupDatasets( Input=[ c, h ] )
s = Slice( SliceType="Plane" )
Show(s)
---------------------------------------------------->8

Can anyone suggest a better way to attach the data?

Thanks,
Paul

How about attaching them to FieldData of the blocks?

Thanks for the reply - we are looking at doing that now instead.  One
downside is that we need to write another filter in order to create a table
so that we can plot the data although we did still require an extract block
before it can be displayed in the line chart.

Ideally we would like the filters to work and the multi-block dataset to be
viewable in the line chart allowing the user to select the blocks in the
display tab.  I might look at fixing/implementing this when I merge back
with the master.

Regards,
Paul

Subject: [Paraview] Working with distributed data
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=yoH-UzZ176dNGQov0=6RJN5NtWiUeLqEO5yDQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have a multiblock dataset with a mixture of volumes and surfaces.  The
data is distributed across all server nodes and all points have a global ID.
 I would like to get put data from the volume onto the surface points where
the global ID matches - is there a filter that does this?  The
vtkPProbeFilter could be used but this does a point lookup - is there a more
efficient one that can match via a global ID?

Thanks,
Paul

Hi,

This is a known issue when a VTK XML file has an appended data section
larger than 2GB(http://public.kitware.com/Bug/view.php?id=6938).

To work around the problem you can look at writing out the file as any of
the following:

   - Partitioned VTK XML
   - Ensight Gold Binary
   - Exodus II ( Will require you too link to the exodus library found at
   http://sourceforge.net/projects/exodusii/ )

Hi Paul,

Am I correct in presuming the primary issue that you have is that the volume
and surface both are being divided differently across the nodes?

If that is correct I would look at the CMFE (Cross Mesh Field Evaluation)
filter that can be found on at
https://github.com/berkgeveci/ComparativeVis/tree/master/CMFEFilter. The
filters first step is to redistributed a dataset based on another datasets
partitioning.

You than could use that logic in your own filter before you do the mapping
based on global ids. If you have any questions on the CMFE code please ask.

C++:

  // get the input objects (should be of the same type)

  vtkDataObject *inObj2 = inInfo2->Get(vtkDataObject::DATA_OBJECT());

  if (inObj1->GetDataObjectType() != inObj2->GetDataObjectType())
    {
    vtkErrorMacro(<< "Inputs are different types.");
    return 1;

  // cast inputs to correct type
  if (vtkDataSet::SafeDownCast(inObj1))
    {
    vtkDataSet* input1 = vtkDataSet::SafeDownCast(inObj1);
    vtkDataSet* input2 = vtkDataSet::SafeDownCast(inObj2);

    vtkDataArray* inArray1 = this->GetInputArrayToProcess(0, input1);
    vtkDataArray* inArray2 = this->GetInputArrayToProcess(0, input2);

    if (!inArray1)
      {
      vtkErrorMacro(<< "Bad inArray1.");
      return 1;
      }
    vtkDebugMacro(<< "Array 1: " << inArray1->GetName());
    if (!inArray2)

      return 1;
      }
    vtkDebugMacro(<< "Array 2: " << inArray2->GetName());

    ...
    }

Am I using the Set/GetInputArrayToProcess functions correctly with regards
to the input ports? Should I instead use helper functions that pass the
names of the two selected arrays and retrieve them from the objects?

Thanks in advance for any insight,
Kevin

tried the first option for now - i assume partitioned vtk == parallel vtk?

  vtkSmartPointer<vtkUnstructuredGridReader> reader =
vtkSmartPointer<vtkUnstructuredGridReader>::New();
  reader->SetFileName(filename);

  char *ofilename = "foo.pvtu";
  cout << "Output filename: " << ofilename << "\n";
  vtkSmartPointer<vtkXMLPUnstructuredGridWriter> writer =
vtkSmartPointer<vtkXMLPUnstructuredGridWriter>::New();
  writer->SetFileName(ofilename);
  writer->SetNumberOfPieces(8);
  writer->SetInputConnection(reader->GetOutputPort());
  writer->Write();

and it works nicely for a smaller dataset (although it writes only one
piece in that case). but, when i run it on the large data set, i get a
segfault:

is this a bug or am i using the parallel writer incorrectly?

Subject: [Paraview] batch create thumbnails for multiple .vtk files?
Message-ID: <AANLkTikj-yVGpbk36Q5ixg_GsGXiTJSKJ02fXHj2o=kO@mail.gmail.com>

When in the course of human events it becomes necessary for one person
to visualize the .vtk files which have been collected from another,
and to assume among the powers of the server that the separate and
manual loading of each would cause undue stress upon the user, a
decent respect to the opinions of the list requires that they should
declare a script which impels the computer to do the visualization.

That's my creative way of asking if anyone has written a script to go
through thousands of .vtk files and create a screenshot of each.
During this project, we've created and collected a great number of
.vtk files, and want to essentially be able to make thumbnails of them
all so we know which should be saved and which can be discarded.

The optimal solution would allow specifying the camera angle to be run
for each screenshot.

Searching for "paraview 'save state'" (no outer quotes) seems to be in
the right direction.  I found
http://www.itk.org/Wiki/ParaView/Python_Scripting but I don't see that
the same filters can be saved and applied to a different data set.

  Thanks!

This should do the trick:
http://paraview.org/Wiki/Take_a_Screenshot_of_a_VTP_File
(linked to from here: http://paraview.org/Wiki/Python_recipes (this
could use some organizing) ).

Or you probably don't need Paraview at all for this - why not use VTK directly?

The array-information indices should not be repeated. You're using
index 1 for both array informations. Just change the 2nd one to 2
(updating the xml default values as well as when you call
GetInputArrayToProcess()).

This won't work. To write a dataset in parallel, you need to use a
partitioning filter such as D3 (vtkDistributedDataFilter). Try opening the
example dataset in ParaView, applying D3 and then saving as pvtu. Ideally,
you would directly write the data partitioned from the simulation. One
partition per rank maybe or you could sub-group using MPI to have fever
files. This is where you would get most scalability out of ParaView if you
are running it in parallel.

HI David

Thanks for the links!!  Do you know if the code at
http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK/Examples/Cxx/Utilities/Screenshot is
designed to be compiled and run from command line?  If so, then I
think it can do the trick if I feed it filenames with a bash script...

   cheers
   - Rob

That example will create an executable that can be run from the command

And if I develop a specific selection plugin.
I can see in the "VTK User'guide" book in "13.4 Selections" page 291 and here: 
http://www.kitware.com/products/html/SelectionsInVTK.html

"vtkSelection is a container class holding one or more vtk-SelectionNode  
objects. Each node contains information indicating what part of the data  is 
selected. A compound selection is interpreted as the union of the individual 
node selections.  We allow selections to consist of multiple nodes so that in 
one place  we can represent selections on multiple parts of the data. For 
example, a  selection on geometry may contain a vtkSelectionNode for both points  
and cells. Another use case is to collect selections from multiple  datasets in 
the same renderer into one place."

So, this means that it could be possible to do this ("For example, a  selection 
on geometry may contain a vtkSelectionNode for both points  and cell").

But, if it is possible, how a plugin processing a data (vtkPolyData, 
vtkUnstructuredGrid, vtkMultiBlocDataSet) on which we want to use one of the 
selection (points or cells) could have this list of selected data (points or 
Cells) ?

Thanks.

Currently, it is not possible to have cells and points selected at the

Hello everyone,

I have compiled paraviewweb with visual studio on a windows 7 machine
but I'm not able to produce any renderings. None of the samples work
except PWService. All the other applications seem to hang, I can see
all the widgets fine but I can not click on any of them. In the
Sandbox everything also hangs but only after I click on the run
button.

Here is some output:

Pjotr,

We haven't tested ParaViewWeb with Windows server yet. We currently
only support Mac and Linux based server machines.

Great Robert; thanks so much!

Thank you again, David, for bringing it to my attention!  You're
right; we didn't need Paraview at all!  Thank you for simplifying the
problem.  :-)

Hi:
I encounted a error described below when compiling a reader plugin with VS2005.
*** SYNTAX ERROR found in parsing the header file E:/a/SgnReader/vtkSgnReader.h before line 23 ***

Project : error PRJ0019: A tool returned an error code from "Generating vtkSgnReaderClientServer.cxx"
I have checked the vtkSgnReader.h and didn't find any probloms. Is there any problem esle which may generate this error?
Thanks.

No, ParaView does not support setting opacity in a color-scale except
when volume rendering.

You may have to use //BTX and //ETX block marker to hide the offending
code in the vtkSgnReader.h which is causing the issue with the
wrappers. Would be helpful if you posted relevant sections of that
header.

Hi,

I've just spotted a bug where d3 causes paraview to crash if the points are
stored a double precision.

Regards,

The request for transparent colors in surface color maps seems to come up relatively frequently, so I added an entry to ParaView UserVoice.  If you want this feature, go vote for it.

Hi Paul,

Can you set up a small case to demonstrate the problem and submit it to
mantis?  I can take a look at it.

Hi Nenad,

Turn OFF ENABLE_MPI4PY. Apparently there is a compatibility header in there
that references symbols (_lt_dlopen...) that part of the gnu tool chain. I
have to ask a higher power first, but most likely I will disable MPI4PY for
Windows. Thank you for bringing this to our attention.

So, to explain my probllem, I want to select cells and then points on a 
geometry.
No one can tell me if such a selection tool is possible ?
Otherwise, how could I contourn this problem ?

Thank you for ideas !

Objet : [Paraview] Re :  Multiple selections: points and cells


And if I develop a specific selection plugin.
I can see in the "VTK User'guide" book in "13.4 Selections" page 291 and here: 
http://www.kitware.com/products/html/SelectionsInVTK.html

"vtkSelection is a container class holding one or more vtk-SelectionNode  
objects. Each node contains information indicating what part of the data  is 
selected. A compound selection is interpreted as the union of the individual 
node selections.  We allow selections to consist of multiple nodes so that in 
one place  we can represent selections on multiple parts of the data. For 
example, a  selection on geometry may contain a vtkSelectionNode for both points  
and cells. Another use case is to collect selections from multiple  datasets in 
the same renderer into one place."

So, this means that it could be possible to do this ("For example, a  selection 
on geometry may contain a vtkSelectionNode for both points  and cell").

But, if it is possible, how a plugin processing a data (vtkPolyData, 
vtkUnstructuredGrid, vtkMultiBlocDataSet) on which we want to use one of the 
selection (points or cells) could have this list of selected data (points or 
Cells) ?

Thanks.

Currently, it is not possible to have cells and points selected at the
same time.

I've created a Python script to demonstrate the problem (you will need to

8<---------------------------------------------------
# connect to the parallel server (2 procs are enough)

Sphere1 = Sphere( guiName="Sphere1", EndTheta=360.0, Center=[0.0, 0.0, 0.0],
StartTheta=0.0, PhiResolution=38, Radius=0.5, ThetaResolution=38,
EndPhi=180.0, StartPhi=0.0 )
ProgrammableFilter3 = ProgrammableFilter( guiName="ProgrammableFilter3",
OutputDataSetType='Same as Input', RequestInformationScript='', Script='pdi

vtk.vtkPoints()\nnewPoints.SetDataTypeToDouble()\nnumPoints =
pdi.GetNumberOfPoints()\nfor i in range(0, numPoints):\n  coord =
pdi.GetPoint(i)\n  x, y, z = coord[:3]\n  x = x * 1\n  y = y * 1.3\n  z = z
* 0.3\n  newPoints.InsertPoint(i, x, y, z)\npdo.SetPoints(newPoints)',
PythonPath='', CopyArrays=0 )
D32 = D3( guiName="D32", BoundaryMode='Duplicate cells', MinimalMemory=0 )
ProcessIdScalars3 = ProcessIdScalars( guiName="ProcessIdScalars3",
RandomMode=0 )
Show()
Render()  # this works
ExtractSurface2 = ExtractSurface( guiName="ExtractSurface2",
NonlinearSubdivisionLevel=1, PieceInvariant=1 )
Show()    # now that ghost cells are required and D3 is rerun it crashes
--------------------------------------------------->8

The crash happens when ghost cells are required.

    Firstly,thanks for the help to solving my last problem. It may be a easy process how to write a reader plugin, so I can only find some simple guide and examples.But I am still puzzled when writing the part of .cxx, so it will be very helpful if there is a detailed and completely  example.

Subject: [Paraview] Problems blending two vtkImageMapToColors with
 vtkImageBlend in ParaView branding App
Message-ID: <AANLkTinT8=ixESN8EdiycdrBAJy04m-4cyxOdcfg68hJ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm trying to blend two vtkImageMapToColors, and I have the following questions:

1) When I try to create the vtkImageMapToColors filters to be passed
later as blending inputs

     m_colorImage =
objectBuilder->createFilter("filters","ImageMapToColors",m_input);

I get the following error/warning:

   "vtkImageMapToColors : RequestInformation: No LookupTable was set"

Nevertheless, when I assign the LUT later, it works as expected. So my
question is:
How should I create the filter to prevent the LUT required warning?

Note: I saw under documentation, that there is the following method
that should do the trick...but I couldn't find the way to pass my
lut's vtkSMProxy as QVariant...

createFilter (const QString &group,
                  const QString &name,
                  QMap< QString, QList< pqOutputPort * > > namedInputs,
                  pqServer *server,
                  const QMap< QString, QVariant > &properties)

2) What should I do to set the alpha channels of a
vtkDiscretizableColorTransferFunction? I can use the addRGBPoint, but
it doesn't accept RGBA as input. Thus I cannot use this lut to blend
the images.

3) Alternatively, I want to use the following method of vtkImageBlend

void 	SetOpacity (int idx, double opacity)

But I don't know how to write the xml for that proxy property. Should
I use vtkSMDoubleVectorProperty and pass both values? Here there's my
actual xml file for vtkImageBlend

   <SourceProxy name="ImageBlend" class="vtkImageBlend" label="ImageBlend">
     <InputProperty
        name="Input"
        command="SetInputConnection">
           <ProxyGroupDomain name="groups">
             <Group name="sources"/>
             <Group name="filters"/>
           </ProxyGroupDomain>
           <DataTypeDomain name="input_type">
             <DataType value="vtkDataImage"/>
           </DataTypeDomain>
      </InputProperty>
     <InputProperty
        name="BlendInput"

Here is a complete example:

Message-ID: <AANLkTi=rJP3ozY5SC20Tbehko8=9x4_7Ff7L81JDsWzE@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,

Trying to animate the HelixSource, that can be found in Examples/Plugin,
Paraview returns this error message : "Cue does not have domain or property
set!"

Is there something that could be done in order to solve this error, and
animate the helix ?

Thank for your answer... and an happy new Year !

Hi,

There is currently a lot of effort put into the superbuild directory. 
It seems interesting, but I can't find much information on the 
functionnality being developped.
Is it somehow related to branded apps? 
Is there a wiki page describing the functionnality?

Best,
Stephane

Hi Stephane,

SuperBuild is something I am working on to build ParaView and it's
dependencies using CMake's external_project feature. External_Project allows
us to download, patch, configure, build and install a dependency with an
easy to use function call, regardless if the dependency uses CMake natively
or not.

Currently it can build Python, Lapack/CLAPACK, NUMPY, OpenMPI, Manta and
FFMPEG. Some of which are dependencies I traditionally have built by hand
for ParaView releases. It's still in it's infancy but when it is ready for
active use I will definitely put up a wiki page and direct people how to use
it to build ParaView.

I will keep everyone

Oops, hit send too quickly.

It will also build (probably today) CGNS and Silo (on Linux/Mac) as well.

I will keep everyone posted!

Message-ID: <7C9F4869E8B9A04F9114D6D07C331DA3022503@DLREXMBX01.intra.dlr.de>

Hello,


I've installed a HDF5 version on my system and I've tried to compile ParaView 3.8.1 with this version.
I used the CMAKE flag "PARAVIEW_USE_SYSTEM_HDF5" therefore. I always get the following error:

ParaView/Utilities/Xdmf2/libsrc/XdmfH5Driver.cxx:189: error: braces around scalar initializer for type ?herr_t (*)(H5FD_t*, unsigned char*, hbool_t)?

The HDF5 version, which I use, is a modified version, which is described in this site:
https://hpcforge.org/plugins/mediawiki/wiki/h5fddsm/index.php/Main_Page

What's going wrong with the installation of ParaView?


best regards,

nathalie

Hi Pjotr,

few comments before getting further for solving the problem that you are facing.

As Utkarsh said we didn't try to have a Windows server for ParaViewWeb
and as a client IE is not the best browser available specially with
the JavaScript renderer. In fact, if the targeted client is IE, you
should use the flash renderer for better performances. For now, the
best client platform is Firefox.

Regarding your problem on Linux, did you get through the FAQ
(http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaViewWeb/FAQ) ?
Which version of ParaView did you use to compile ParaViewWeb ?
Do you manage to make that ParaView rendering working ? To try it,
launch the pvpython and run the following lines

from paraview.simple import *
Sphere()
Show()
Render()

I let you get back to us for more feedback if none of this help you.

Seb

My guess is that you have an API incompatibility between your version and the version that XDMF expects. If you don't need the Xdmf functionality then disable Xdmf during the CMake configuration of ParaView. This is what I do as I am still dependent on HDF Version 1.6.9 and it seems to compile just fine.

I get a similar behavior from someone else which had some network
configuration issue on the ParaViewWeb server computer. To check if
you have the same problem, you can try to start a visualization
session with PWApp and go to PWService to "Quit" that running session.
And if you get an error, this should help you to identify the
miss-matching network configuration on that computer.

Subject: [Paraview] How to set a dataset unselectable  and in wireframe ?
Message-ID: <128685.92549.qm@web26104.mail.ukl.yahoo.com>

Hi,

I have a plugin reader that makes several vtkUnstructuredGurid outputs.   I have 
seen that in object inspector (paraview) we can make an object unselectable and 
render it in wireframe...
I would like to know if it 's possible to directly set my ouput 
vtkUnstructuredGrid objects with such properties or should It be only done in 
Object Inspector ? 


If it is possible to do it in a plugin reader, what is the best way for doing 
this ?

Thank you.

Subject: [Paraview] Marking points in contours
Message-ID: <20110107172148.118620@gmx.net>

Hi folks,
i'm looking for a possility to mark certain points within contour plots. The data which i'm using are binary images stored as unsigned char, non-uniform spacing (0.2, 0.2, 0.1) and a shifted origin. The points which i want to mark are given in pixel(?)-coordinates (e.g. (20,20,10)) instead of world-coordinates (given with respect to origin and spacing).
I found the option Edit->FindData, but no pixels are found when i search for certain points (pixel-coordiates).
Does anyone have a solution?

Thanks in advance,
Juergen

Hello Sebastien,

Paraview rendering works. I get a (very low polygon) sphere when
running your python lines. I have looked at the FAQ already. I tried
to start PWServer manually and it runs. My working directory is also
set up and all the log files appear there and as said before if I
upload datasets they also appear there. When I "quit" a running
session I do not get an error immediately (Using firefox 3.6). Only
when I hit the back button in my browser it says "An error occured
during the loading. Error: Connection failed".

Dear all:

I have 3D data with 20-noded hexahedral elements.

When I try a Reflection filter for my data I get the artifact as shown
in attached figure. Is it a bug or known issue? Can I remove it somehow?

This happens on both LINUX and WINDOWS ParaView version 3.8.1

Many thanks,
Hom Nath

The HDF5 you are using is our 'modified' one which supports external VFD compilation (such as the H5FDdsm code). paraview works fine with it, but the Xdmf that comes with paraview by default won't compile against it.

Our instructions/documentation so far are not very complete but we are working on it. We have a couple of deadlines to meet over the next couple of weeks so can't really help you out right now, but once we get the full docs written up, we will make sure you are cc'd.

To cut a long story short, we have our own paraview, with a modified Xdmf, git://git.cscs.ch/ParaView.git - submodules are different from the kitware versions for Xdmf, hdf etc. You may have more luck using the 'cscs-release' branch from there (it's a bit old, but was tested by 3rd parties and worked).

In a couple of weeks we ought to have things stable enough to update all the wikis etc (and branches) with the correct info for building and testing

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView 3.8.1 and HDF5

Hello,


I've installed a HDF5 version on my system and I've tried to compile ParaView 3.8.1 with this version.
I used the CMAKE flag "PARAVIEW_USE_SYSTEM_HDF5" therefore. I always get the following error:

ParaView/Utilities/Xdmf2/libsrc/XdmfH5Driver.cxx:189: error: braces around scalar initializer for type 'herr_t (*)(H5FD_t*, unsigned char*, hbool_t)'

The HDF5 version, which I use, is a modified version, which is described in this site:
https://hpcforge.org/plugins/mediawiki/wiki/h5fddsm/index.php/Main_Page

What's going wrong with the installation of ParaView?


best regards,

nathalie

Ricardo,

Looks like currently there's no way to change the cube-axes font and
other properties. Feel free to add a feature request for that. Seems
like a reasonable request.

Subject: [Paraview] slice + stream tracer only on 1/2 of the slice
Message-ID: <4D2B1D97.8020804@inria.fr>

I make a z-slice of 3D data. I would like to use stream tracer only on 
the top 1/2. How do I do this?
Thanks if advance,
Stephen

You could clip the data instead of slice and then stream-trace the
clipped part.

Dear all,

Is there a python command which can be used to turn off the clipping plan
when applying a clip filter?

Thanks,

By turning off clip plane, you mean hiding the widget? There is clean
way of hiding the widget from Python. A work around is setting the
active source to be something other than the clip filter using
SetActiveSource(...)

Subject: [Paraview] VisIt bridge
Message-ID: <BAY148-w52109815EC9947A14BFA3EB20F0@phx.gbl>


The instructions for building the bridge at http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/VisIt_Database_Bridge, esp. the section entitled "Building the ParaView Plugin" seems to be outdated:

#!/bin/bash
cd ./ParaView3/Plugins/VisItDatabaseBridge      # Switch into the bridge plugin source directory.
curious recomendation since the usual way to build with cmake consists in not building in the source directory
mkdir bin                                       # Make a directory for our out of source build.
cd bin                                          # Switch into the out of source build dir.
ccmake ../                                      # Set BOOTSTRAP=ON, and whatever else makes sense ;) there is no BOOTSTRAP value in the ccmake menu

and last I get the following errors:

 CMake Error at CMake/ParaViewConfig.cmake:8 (INCLUDE):
   include called with wrong number of arguments.  Include only takes one
   file.
 Call Stack (most recent call first):
   CMakeLists.txt:42 (include)

 CMake Error at CMake/VisItConfig.cmake:33 (MESSAGE):
   Set VISIT_BASE to the path to your local VisIt 1.10.0 sources.
 Call Stack (most recent call first):

Any help?

What version are you using? I just tried with git-master (3.9) and
selection seems to work fine on disk_out_ref dataset with SurfaceLIC.

Hi Fred,

That version of the plugin has been depricated and those pages should all be
removed. Rob rewrote and vastly improved the VisIt bridge.  The CMake
options that need to be set now are PARAVIEW_USE_VISITBRIDGE:BOOL=ON and to
tell ParaView where a boost header installation is. Our apologize for the
confusion!

I am using the 3.8.1-RC1.
I will download the 3.8.1 on your website and compile it, and check if it
works. I will let you know.

Subject: [Paraview] XDFM to load staggered vector data
Message-ID: <4D2C71A7.1020702@tp4.rub.de>

Hi all,

I have a 3-D curvilinear HDF5 dataset which contains both scalar and vector data, and I would like to load it into Paraview. The scalar data is cell-centered, while the vector components are centered on the cells' faces, e.g. for vector (Bx,By,Bz),

Bx is at r_(i-1/2, j, k) with {i,j,k} in [0, Nx] x [0, Ny-1] x [0, Nz-1]
By is at r_(i, j-1/2, k) with {i,j,k} in [0, Nx-1] x [0, Ny] x [0, Nz-1]
Bz is at r_(i, j, k-1/2) with {i,j,k} in [0, Nx-1] x [0, Ny-1] x [0, Nz] ,

where r_(i,j,k) is the center of the cell. From the *.h5 file, all three components look like scalars, except that their dimensionality in the respective directions is increased by one.
For scalar data, I am using this XDMF sample file, which works like a charm:

----------------------------------------------------------------
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<!DOCTYPE Xdmf SYSTEM "Xdmf.dtd" []>
<Xdmf Version="2.0">
 <Domain>
   <Grid Name="CronosMesh" GridType="Uniform">
     <Topology TopologyType="3DSMesh" NumberOfElements="12 11 10"/>
     <Geometry GeometryType="X_Y_Z">
       <DataItem Dimensions="12 11 10" NumberType="Float" Precision="4" Format="HDF">
        ../gtest_grid.h5:/X
       </DataItem>
       <DataItem Dimensions="12 11 10" NumberType="Float" Precision="4" Format="HDF">
        ../gtest_grid.h5:/Y
       </DataItem>
       <DataItem Dimensions="12 11 10" NumberType="Float" Precision="4" Format="HDF">
        ../gtest_grid.h5:/Z
       </DataItem>
     </Geometry>
     <Attribute Name="Density" AttributeType="Scalar" Center="Cell">
       <DataItem Dimensions="11 10 9" NumberType="Float" Precision="4" Format="HDF">
        ../gtest_float/gtest_flt_step0.h5:/Data/rho
       </DataItem>
     </Attribute>
   </Grid>
 </Domain>
</Xdmf>
----------------------------------------------------------------

Now my question is: How exactly do I set up the corresponding Attribute tag group for the B vector? I have seen solutions which use the JOIN function, but I understand this needs arrays of the same size. So I was thinking of something like

but then B_field won't even show up in Paraview's object inspector. I also noticed that the same tends to occur for scalar data as soon as Center is set to either "Edge" or "Face". Since the wiki at xdmf.org doesn't say anything about these two options beyond that they exist, I was wondering how exactly these should be used.

Any help would be much appreciated.
Best wishes, Jens.

PS: Is there a dedicated XDMF mailing list which would be prefered for this topic?

I just tried with the 3.8.1 (64bits), and it crashes again.

The "Select Cells On" and "Select Points On" don't work too, even if I
display the mesh or the surface instead of the surfaceLIC. Maybe an error of
myself while compiling ?

Is there a required option in the compilation ?

Building the old VisIt bridge is really complicated hence the rewrite. It is
included prebuilt in the ParaView 3.8 binaries if you just want to use it.
Otherwise you will need to checkout our development git repository and build

Hello,

thanks a lot for the hint. I have already expected, that there a some problems with ParaView's Xdmf.
But I have still one more question:
I've downloaded and installed your modified ParaView now. I've tried to install the Icarus-Plugin, but I get always the following compilation error:

	syntax error
	*** SYNTAX ERROR found in parsing the header file /home/nathalie/Desktop/Icarus-0.9.0/vtkDSMManager.h before line 99 ***
	make[2]: *** [vtkDSMManagerClientServer.cxx] Error 1
	make[1]: *** [CMakeFiles/CSCS_DSM.dir/all] Error 2

This failure occures, wehen vtkGetMacro is called.
I'm not sure what occurs the failure.
Can you help me, please?

best reagrds,
nathalie

The HDF5 you are using is our 'modified' one which supports external VFD compilation (such as the H5FDdsm code). paraview works fine with it, but the Xdmf that comes with paraview by default won't compile against it.

Our instructions/documentation so far are not very complete but we are working on it. We have a couple of deadlines to meet over the next couple of weeks so can't really help you out right now, but once we get the full docs written up, we will make sure you are cc'd.

To cut a long story short, we have our own paraview, with a modified Xdmf, git://git.cscs.ch/ParaView.git - submodules are different from the kitware versions for Xdmf, hdf etc. You may have more luck using the 'cscs-release' branch from there (it's a bit old, but was tested by 3rd parties and worked).

In a couple of weeks we ought to have things stable enough to update all the wikis etc (and branches) with the correct info for building and testing

Hello,


I've installed a HDF5 version on my system and I've tried to compile ParaView 3.8.1 with this version.
I used the CMAKE flag "PARAVIEW_USE_SYSTEM_HDF5" therefore. I always get the following error:

ParaView/Utilities/Xdmf2/libsrc/XdmfH5Driver.cxx:189: error: braces around scalar initializer for type 'herr_t (*)(H5FD_t*, unsigned char*, hbool_t)'

The HDF5 version, which I use, is a modified version, which is described in this site:
https://hpcforge.org/plugins/mediawiki/wiki/h5fddsm/index.php/Main_Page

What's going wrong with the installation of ParaView?


best regards,

nathalie

Am I really the only one with problems with parallel projection?

    * as seen today the orbit animation has a "auto-zoom-off" with
      parallel projection
    * Zoom-factoris missing in GUI
    * Zoom-factor is not saved with state files.

See my bug here: http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=10824

I'm guessing ....

It looks like you've got paraview+stuff on the master (cscs-release) branch, but the icarus plugin is no longer compatible. We are building against our not yet released 'steering' branch, but left our developments in icarus on the master branch.

suggestion. Do a git log of paraview, see the most recent date, then update icarus to a date around then (ie go back to the same date) - does the compilation work?

it looks like we messed up - so far we have only a small number of users/collaborators, so didn't quite expect anyone else to build the lot. We'll make the steering stuff available asap. please bear with us, we're struggling to get our stuff ready for others to use ...

Mike's right, but I think even when you add BTX/ETX, the compilation will fail due to incompatibilities later. Give it a try though (the fail is because the cscs-release branch was made before the wrapper fixes from David Gobbi went in, and the newer code doesn't have them in all places)

Hi Nathalie,

I just checked what we had done with our last user and yes putting //BTX 
and //ETX around the line 99 in vtkDsmManager.h will fix it. We forgot 
to put this fix in the tarball. It is fixed in the Icarus git master 
branch though.

The icarus plugin on hpcforge and the cscs-release branch  are still 
compatible, be sure to do a git submodule update --init so that you get 
the right versions of the different submodules:

git clone git://git.cscs.ch/ParaView.git
git checkout cscs-release
git submodule update --init

Everything should be working then.

Jerome

Hi, I have an ascii file with 4 fileds:

X Y Z C

where X, Y, Z represent the coordinates of the point, and C represent 
the component/value of the point (e.g. temperature, umidity, ecc.) I 
want to convert this file in a vtk file. Is it possible? How can I do 
it? Thanks

Hi Luca,

There are many ways to do this. However, if you are familar with
python I would suggest you take a look at PyEVTK:
https://bitbucket.org/pauloh/pyevtk/overview.

If you want to use PyEVTK, you'll have to:

1) Read your data and store it in 4 numpy arrays: x, y, z and C.
2) Write the following two lines to export them as a VTK file:
       from evtk.hl import pointsToVTK
       pointsToVTK("./points", x, y, z, data = {"C" : C })

This will create a point.vtu file in the current directory which
contains an unstructured VTK grid.
If the coordinates x, y, z are the vertices of a rectilinear or
structured grid, you could also export the data as a structured or
rectilinear grid (see the VTK file format document for details). There
are examples in PyEVTK of how to do this.

Good luck,

Paulo

This should do what you want:

This would too, but it is more manual:

You should be able to read the ascii file directly into ParaView.  Attempt to load the file and then, assuming you have not used an extension reserved for another reader's files, select "Comma-separated-values" from the next dialog box listing all available readers.  This is the csv reader, but you can replace the delimiter to any character you want (in your case, I think you want space).

That will load the data as a table.  Simply run the Table to Points filter to convert them to a collection of points in space.  From there you can trivially write the data out in VTK format.

Message-ID: <4D2DEDC8.5020300@gmail.com>

  Hello everyone,

I'm going to use CoProcessing library. I'm moving step by step as 
described in SC10_tutorial. I don't understand slide 99. I can't  create 
Live Data Source. It isn't presented in my PV version (3.8.1). How can I 
add it?

Thanks,
Andrey.

Hi Andrey,

When I wrote those slides, the code for the Live Data Source had not yet
received approval for public release.  The code is now available but has yet
to be merged with the paraview main release.  You'll have to compile
paraview yourself in order to use the Live Data Source.  The code can be
found in the live-data branch of the git repository git://
github.com/patmarion/ParaView.git

It did the trick and thanks!

Because there is a checkbox for it, I thought it might have a clean way for
it.

Dear paraview users,

I am trying select cell-ids of surface of 3D.
When picking surface triangle element, 
tetrahedral element was selected.
I want to select only triangle elements.
Could you show me how to pick triangle elements
not tetrahedral elements ?

Best regards,

Message-ID: <AANLkTikVgN_Y0hCHkP7d=FYPO1C7J2_mf8gHXeE6Sxrz@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I need to read time series data with Plot3D Function format. ParaView
uses a vtkMulitBlockPLOT3DReader to read Plot3D files, but it does not
support Function file. So I modified this source to read them
referring to a vtkPLOT3DReader which supports Function format. After
that, I confirmed this worked well.
In ParaView built from git source, time-series data with Plot3D Q file
can be read. Would you tell me how to also read time-series data with
Plot3D Function format by Modifing a reader.xml file?

Thanks,
yoshimi

Subject: [Paraview] Level of Detail (LOD) significantly slower in PV3.9.0
 compared to PV3.8.1
Message-ID: <4D2EF908.1040100@DLR.de>

Hi,


i have a bigger case (20e6 points) - there i found the time from 
clicking for e.g. rotation till showing the coarse view (LOD) is nearly 
the same, however from the coarse view back to the detailed one pv 3.9.0 
is about factor of 2-4 slower compared to pv 3.8.1.

My settings of the LOD are:

LOD Threshold (on), 0 MB
LOD Resolution (160x160x160)
Outline Threshold: 0 MCells
LockInteractive Render 0
Allow Rendering Interrupts: off

Output of Timer Log:

3.9.0:

Interactive Render, 3.79491 seconds

Interactive Render,  0.029547 seconds

Still Render,  7.85055 seconds

Still Render,  6.95442 seconds

3.8.1

Interactive Render, 3.73134 seconds

     Execute vtkQuadricClustering id: 371,  3.69637 seconds

     Execute vtkPolyDataMapper id: 166,  3.7e-05 seconds

     OpenGL Dev Render,  0.029671 seconds

         Execute vtkPolyDataMapper id: 41,  1.9e-05 seconds

         Execute vtkPolyDataMapper id: 166,  1.6e-05 seconds

     OpenGL Dev Render,  0.000517 seconds

     OpenGL Dev Render,  1.7e-05 seconds

Interactive Render,  0.014383 seconds

     OpenGL Dev Render,  0.000274 seconds

         Execute vtkPolyDataMapper id: 41,  1.7e-05 seconds

         Execute vtkPolyDataMapper id: 166,  1.6e-05 seconds

     OpenGL Dev Render,  0.00043 seconds

     OpenGL Dev Render,  1.3e-05 seconds

Still Render,  1.19411 seconds

     OpenGL Dev Render,  1.19291 seconds

         Execute vtkPolyDataMapper id: 41,  1.8e-05 seconds

         Execute vtkPolyDataMapper id: 169,  1.7e-05 seconds

     OpenGL Dev Render,  0.000572 seconds

     OpenGL Dev Render,  1.7e-05 seconds



What are the changes between 3.9.0 and 3.8.1 regarding the LOD? Seems, 
3.9.0 is not using OpenGL? I have used the same complier-settings for 
both versions.

If checked the effect with smaller cases - there the effect is smaller.

Best regards,

     Stefan

ParaView 3.9 has a feature which can be turned off by the user using
the Setting dialog which results in ParaView delaying the switch back
from Interactive render by a few seconds. You should be seeing a
"countdown" in the status bar as that starts happening. Within this
time, user can start interaction again thus avoid having to wait for
fullres render when doing continuous adjustments to the camera.

If you don't want it, turn if off by using Edit | Settings dialog and
then on the Render View page, set "Lock Interactive Render" slider to
0.

Try apply a filter such a "Extract Surface" and then select on the
surface. "Extract Surface" will extract surface triangles from your
tets, then you can select those. One cannot select faces of a cell
without selecting the whole cell in ParaView, so you have to apply a
filter to change your dataset accordingly.

Subject: [Paraview] Rotation
Message-ID: <4D2F0735.9020706@informatik.uni-erlangen.de>

Hello,

to the best of my knowledge the orient feature of glyphs can be used to 
orient glyphs along a vector field. The direction is used for 
orientation and the magnitude seems to relate to scaling. However I 
wonder how to roll the glyph around the direction vector according to 
some scalar field lets say.

Actually I would like to use a vector3 field as input which are 
axis-angle encoded rotations and use those to rotate the glyphs to the 
correct position. How do I go about doing that? Filters like "transform" 
cannot use a field as rotation input can they?

Best regards,
Tobias

Stefan,

You are not seeing the OpenGL-render log events since possibly your
threshold is high. Simply change the "Time Threshold" to "Show All" in
the Timer Log dialog on both processes.

Infact I am seeing very comparable results. Am using debug builds for
both 3.8.1 and 3.9 (as of this morning). Here are my timer logs:

3.8.1
-----------------------------
Interactive Render,  0.004477 seconds
    OpenGL Dev Render,  0.000933 seconds
        Execute vtkPolyDataMapper id: 41,  9.2e-05 seconds
        Execute vtkPolyDataMapper id: 231,  8.8e-05 seconds
    OpenGL Dev Render,  0.001162 seconds
    OpenGL Dev Render,  3.6e-05 seconds
Still Render,  0.139497 seconds
    OpenGL Dev Render,  0.1356 seconds
        Execute vtkPolyDataMapper id: 41,  9.4e-05 seconds
        Execute vtkPolyDataMapper id: 234,  9.5e-05 seconds
    OpenGL Dev Render,  0.001332 seconds
    OpenGL Dev Render,  3.6e-05 seconds


3.9.0
----------------------------------------------------------
Interactive Render,  0.004025 seconds
    OpenGL Dev Render,  0.001218 seconds
    OpenGL Dev Render,  3.6e-05 seconds
Still Render,  0.143199 seconds
    OpenGL Dev Render,  0.001369 seconds
    OpenGL Dev Render,  4.2e-05 seconds

I simply created a sphere with theta and phi resolution set to 1024.
Make sure that the "Immediate Mode Rendering" checkbox is the same in
both cases (I have it off for both).

After some trials I managed to get the live data source to work with

Now, is there any expected timeline when it will be merged to the

Not really. So are you saying that surface selection does not work at
all on your machine? Even without loading the SurfaceLIC plugin at
all?

What is the color depth on your display? Surface selection requires at least
32 bits for color. If you run TestAreaSelections it will tell you if that is
the problem.

Hi Takuya,

I'm really happy to hear that the live data source works with your
simulation code!  And I'm very impressed you were able to make it work
without any documentation!  Let me know if you have any further questions.

I cannot give you an expected timeline for merging with the mainline, but
there is another option- I can rebase the branch onto the HEAD version of
paraview.  The code still won't be ready for merging with the mainline, but
at least it would work with today's paraview.  One of the reasons I want to
delay integration (and even a rebase) is because there is active work on the
paraview connection management code (called collaboration.)  When that work
is complete, it might change the way I do the connection handling for the
live data source.

Subject: [Paraview] Tecplot reader from PV 3.8.1 fails on Linux Redhat CentOS
Message-ID: <4D2F35AC.8080900@onera.fr>

Hello, all.

I have been using Paraview 3.8.1 with the Tecplot reader without a 
problem on an old HP xw4200 workstation with Linux 64 Redhat 5. The only 
thing that did not work was the LIC plugin because my graphic card 
driver was too old.

Today, my workstation has been replaced and I have now a Dell T3500 with 
Linux 64 Redhat CentOS, but the Tecplot reader fails. I get no error 
message, each array in the dataset is recognized with its correct name, 
but all values are completely wrong: each array (coordinates or CFD 
scalars) is in the range [0,9] or [-9,9] and the drawing in the 3D 
window looks like an aircraft after a crash! The problem appears both 
with PV 3.8.1 32 bits and PV 3.8.1 64 bits. I am using the binaries from 
the Paraview download page.

Our CFD software produces only Tecplot files and I have a workaround 
with a small utility that can convert my ascii Tecplot Datasets into 
ascii VTM Datasets, and at least the LIC plugin works fine on theswe VTM 
datasets.  But translating Tecplot datasets into VTM datasets is very 
annoying when I am using large CFD datasets for a full aircraft because 
it duplicates my data and it reduces my free disk space. Does anyone has 
an idea of what could be done to repair the Tecplot Reader on CentOS?

Best regards.

Hi,

I'm exposing the file name for several sources and I would like the GUI to
update when the file name changes.  Is this possible with the XML generated
GUIs?  An example in the ParaView source is the tecplot reader - if the file
name is exposed it does not update the array list when changed.

Thanks,

Hi Richard,

Was the version of ParaView you used on the HP workstation a self-compiled
version or from downloaded binaries? Which version of Tecplot are the files
formatted in, and these haven't changed between workstations? If possible,
could you post a header of one of the Tecplot files?

Hi Adriano.
I always used the downloaded 3.8.1 binaries from the Paraview download 
page. Following is the header of my ascii Tecplot File. I don't know 
exactly for which Tecplot version they are formatted by our CFD 
software, but they are readable by Tecplot 360, and I am using the same 
Tecplot files that I used on my HP workstation.

> TITLE = ""
> VARIABLES = "x" "y" "z" "frictionvectorx" "frictionvectory" 
> "frictionvectorz" "frictionmodulus" "yplusmeshsize"
> ZONE T="Window(s) : sf13257_blk_39",  I=17,  J=13, F=BLOCK
>  2.6397699E+01  2.6377867E+01  2.6358173E+01  2.6338665E+01  
> 2.6319424E+01  2.6300579E+01
This is a multiblock dataset and the file contains many Zones (one for 
each block). Note that the third dimension K is missing as each block is 
a surface grid. Tecplot 360 assumes that K=1, and the PV 3.8.1 Tecplot 
reader also does not care of the missing K dimension as it was working 
on HP Redhat 5. On Dell CentOS, no error message, but the data are 
incoherent.

Regards.

Richard

Unfortunately, this is not possible with auto-generated GUIs. You have
have a custom panel in which you explicitly update property
informations when the filename is changed.

Ah, ok. Well, I have no answer, although it seems very strange that the
binaries should perform so differently. I use CentOS 5.4 with an older
version of ParaView. If I get hold of the ParaView 3.8.1 binaries, I'll test
out the Tecplot multiblock reader myself and see how it goes.

CentOS

Hi Adriano.
I always used the downloaded 3.8.1 binaries from the Paraview download page.
Following is the header of my ascii Tecplot File. I don't know exactly for
which Tecplot version they are formatted by our CFD software, but they are
readable by Tecplot 360, and I am using the same Tecplot files that I used
on my HP workstation.

> TITLE = ""
> VARIABLES = "x" "y" "z" "frictionvectorx" "frictionvectory" 
> "frictionvectorz" "frictionmodulus" "yplusmeshsize"
> ZONE T="Window(s) : sf13257_blk_39",  I=17,  J=13, F=BLOCK
>  2.6397699E+01  2.6377867E+01  2.6358173E+01  2.6338665E+01
> 2.6319424E+01  2.6300579E+01
This is a multiblock dataset and the file contains many Zones (one for each
block). Note that the third dimension K is missing as each block is a
surface grid. Tecplot 360 assumes that K=1, and the PV 3.8.1 Tecplot reader
also does not care of the missing K dimension as it was working on HP Redhat
5. On Dell CentOS, no error message, but the data are incoherent.

Regards.

Thank you for your help, Adriano.

In fact, only the Tecplot reader has problems on CentOS. I tested again 
this morning: the Tecplot reader fails on both 32 bits and 64 bits 
binaries. But once I have converted my data into VTM files, PV 3.8.1 
binaries are working fine and I can use the LIC plugin.

Subject: [Paraview] Hint to color the output by a given array
Message-ID: <OF6866888C.7682EA55-ONC1257818.003DA4A9-C1257818.003DEF13@notes.edfgdf.fr>

Hi,

Is there a Hint tag that I can use to tell ParaView to color the output of 
a given filter by a given array?
By default, ParaView uses for the output the same colot as was used for 
the input, which is fine in most cases. 
However, I would sometimes like to specify a given color for the output 
different than for the input, is it possible?

Typical use case : in the filter, set an array as the "ActiveVector" 
(using output->GetPointData()->SetActiveVectors(my_array_name)), 
and I would like the output to be colored by this vector by default.

Best,
Stephane

It's not possible currently, but not a bad idea at all. Feel free to add it
to the bug tracker. Shouldn't be too hard to implement.

I finally got back around to this problem and was able to correct the 
issue. The primary issue seemed to be that I was trying to import 32-bit 
numpy into a 64-bit Python interpreter installed with 64-bit Paraview. A 
secondary issue was a lack of understanding of how to use PYTHONPATH. 

I removed the 64-bit version of Paraview, and installed the 32-bit 
version. I then added a 'numpy.pth' file to the Paraview Python 
site-packages folder with the path to my previously installed Python 
site-packages folder (with numpy module). Now I can use numpy and the 
Python calculator and programmable filter!

That is a strange error. Usually it prints what library it had an issue 
with. That said, I am assuming you're numpy was built against lapack/blas 
or clapack? Are those dlls in your path as well?

Both the Paraview and Windows Python versions are 2.6. Any ideas on how to

Hi David and all,
I am writing a reader plugin for ParaView. A test program without the VTK wrapping approves that I can get all the header (metadata) and grid data correctly. However, when I following the examples posted in
http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/ParaView/Examples/Plugins/Reader
http://www.kitware.com/products/html/WritingAParaViewReaderPlug-in.html
and vtkStructuredGridReader.h/.cxx

I got confused. Shall I subclass vtkStructuredGridAlgorithm or vtkStructuredGridReader? What are the differences? With minor differences in the code, i.e. defining char* FileName, I have both scenarios built fine. 

Let's say, we are subclassing vtkStructuredGridAlgorithm for now on. After I populate values as the following

int vtkGRIB2Reader::RequestInformation(vtkInformation* vtkNotUsed(request), 								vtkInformationVector** vtkNotUsed(inputVector),							vtkInformationVector *outputVector)
{
	...
	vtkInformation* outInfo = outputVector->GetInformationObject(0);
	
	outInfo->Set(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::WHOLE_EXTENT(),	ext, 6);
	outInfo->Set(vtkDataObject::SPACING(),	this->Spacing, 3);
	outInfo->Set(vtkDataObject::ORIGIN(), 	this->Origin, 3);	

	return 1;
}

In ParaView Object Inspector / Information widget, I did not see any update in all the fields except Statistics / Type: Structured (Curvilinear) Grid. Would you please help me? Did I populate outInof in the wrong place? Thanks a lot.

Best,
xunlei

Message-ID: <4BB56E3B-5B25-42C1-9DBC-37C44939526B@ec-nantes.fr>

hello,

I am trying to do a very particular thing.

A have a mesh (unstructured), with a displacement field (dep) that  
depens on some parameters (time, temperature...), and I will like to  
visualise the total volume sweep by the mesh.

Until now my approach is to calculate the field for a given parameter,  
then warp the mesh with the displacement field, extract the surface  
and append the surface mesh to the final mesh.

the problem is that the final mesh is very very big. I will like to  
know of a way to clean internal elements, so I can keep only the  
envelope mesh.

any ideas....

Felipe

Message-ID: <AANLkTikUqbxXKMXXmr0sh-6FR_gaXgycRNkh4agcxqFR@mail.gmail.com>

Hi paraviewers!

I tried to change Data Range of color bar by paraview python script.
But It didn't work.
Does someone know the reasson?
Is there another way to change Data Range in script?

Kind Regards,
Shinya

Position=[0.87, 0.25] )

1_p_PVLookupTable = GetLookupTableForArray( "p", 1, RGBPoints=[0.0,
0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.5, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ScalarRangeInitialized=1.0 )
ScalarBarWidgetRepresentation2.LookupTable = a1_p_PVLookupTable

Subject: [Paraview] creating time in a filter
Message-ID: <OFE33BFD64.CA9FED33-ONC125781C.003FE1F2-C125781C.00404FBD@notes.edfgdf.fr>

Hi,

I have a static source, and a filter that creates some time (it applies a 
transformation that can be animated using the time from the pipeline).
If I advertise that this filter provides time to the pipeline using 
outInfo->Set(vtkStreamingDemandDrivePipeline::TIME_RANGE(), range, 2);
in the requestinformation method, the requestdata method is not called 
when animating over time.

If I set the exact same flag in the reader, it is called when requesting 
another time.

So : is there a difference as to how sources are treated depending if they 
have an input or not, and how can a filter advertise that even if its 
input is static (no TIME_RANGE nor TIME_STEPS), it deals with time and 
should be called for new time requests?

Best,
Stephane

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView v3.9.0: problems with exporter plug-in
Message-ID: <AANLkTinncWPOBgWybYy7qeGFzgNb97kJYKET7pJRRspS@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

Because of Xdmf problems inside of v3.8.1, I tried to use my exporter
plug-in with current v3.9.0 sources. I downloaded sources from Git
repository and compiled them with Visual Studio 2008 SP1, Python 2.7
and OpenMPI 1.4.3. Unfortunately, in exported scene I got only center
of rotation axes and orientation axes.

After closer inspection, I made very short snipped that shows the
problem. In class derived from vtkExporter, in function WriteData() I
override, I call following sequence:

   - for every renderer in RenderWindow
     - for every actor in renderer // only 3d actors
       - mapper = actor.GetMapper()
       - if(mapper != NULL)
         - mappers_input = mapper.GetInput()
         - print mappers_input // PROBLEM: NULL for whatever I add to
pipeline, instead of 2 axes meshes

At the moment, I read 3 renderers, the first renderer has 5 actors (2
for center of rotation axes mesh and 3 LOD actors), the second 0 and
the third has 9 actors (all for orientation axes mesh). The problem is
in 3 LOD actors for which I get vtkCompositePolyDataMapper2 objects as
mappers, but which return NULL on GetInput() always! In v3.8.x I used
same mechanism to get vtkPolyData and other data sets from which I
would later extract scene's properties.

Am I doing something wrong or exporter's part still requires some work
before v3.9.0 is released? Btw, similar occurs when I try to export
scene to VRML - only center of rotation axes mesh is exported.

Thanks,
Nenad.

Don't use vtkMapper::GetInput(), that downcasts to vtkPolyData. Using
GetInputDataObject(..) API. That should return you the dataobject. It
may be a vtkCOmpositeDataSet (since ParaView no longer merges blocks
in composite dataset before rendering). You'll have to handle each
block in your exporter.

The arguments to GetLookupTableForArray() are only the default values,
when a new lookuptable is created. If one exists, then they don't make
any changes.
Change the RGBPoints explicitly as follows:

1_p_PVLookupTable.RGBPoints = [....]

Message-ID: <7C9F4869E8B9A04F9114D6D07C331DA3028F80@DLREXMBX01.intra.dlr.de>

Hello,

I have just one more question regarding HDF5 and ParaView. You wrote that your version of ParaView provides also a modified Xdmf and I have seen in XdmfHDF.cxx, that there are several function calls for writing data to the DSM. So I have tried to write a VTK object directly to the DSM via the vtkXdmfWriter, but therefore the member-variable "Domain" have to be set to the value "DSM" (line 730 in XdmfHDF.cxx) and this is never the case. 
Do I have to set special parameters for the vtkXdmfWriter or doesn't the writer allow writing to the DSM at all? 

best regards,
nathalie

Subject: [Paraview] Problems uploading files for Plot3D reading
Message-ID: <AANLkTikjE_W9UNQjt1TNsaDCrT_1nDi6YN_BZbaWEYPk@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Paraview,

earlier i had a problem uploading a .xyz file and a .q file but Mr. Geveci
pointed out that the files did not exactly match in format (the grid was in
ASCII geometry while the .q file was in binary). Therefore i used a python
convert file to correct this.

Now I have a grid file that will not load correctly even after I attempted
converting it to the correct format with the python script. The only way i
can successfully upload the grid file *without* converting it is to use the
settings- Only MultiGrid checked, and BigEndian. Yet, then i am unable to
upload to the .q file over that.

Any suggestions?

Thanks,
Joe Ahdoot

I know somebody who's running Ubuntu 10.04 and doesn't have this problem

 Hi David:

still didn't / doesn't work (slightly different message):

We use a customized vtkXdmfWriter which is inside the Icarus plugin. The writer is a subclass of the one in paraview and overrides a number of methods to

a) set the DSM manager etc

b) handle parallel writes properly using an H5MB utility that's also in there. This hooks into the callback mechanism of (the modified) Xdmf writing to delay creation of groups/datasets/etc until all processes have exchanged info (done in the H5MB utility).



It should write to DSM very nicely. I think we have a test somewhere which creates a DSM on nodes and writes to it using the writer. Maybe this test got squashed at some time.



Look in Icarus/DSMManager for the XdmfWriter classes. It may be that many fixes on the main branch that you are using don't exist. For writing to the DSM from paraview using Xdmf, the steering branch is the one to use, but we haven't made it public yet. we're trying to write it all up and submit it for publication, once that's done, we'll move the steering branch onto the public repo.



in Icarus/DSMManager key code is in XdmfH5MBCallback (the callback stuff that creates a tree from all nodes writing, then synchronizes them so collective dataset creates happen correctly - even when nodes are writing nothing). H5MB, the tree code used by above. The writer we use is XdmfWriter4 : see this snippet from the latest version which writes for us. Using this we can have paraview running on one set of nodes, write data into the DSM, and have it appear in another paraview session somewhere else using a shared DSM! This was our first bi-directional test of the DSM within paraview. For writing data into the simulation from paraview, we have more specialized HDF5 write code since the XdmfWriter carries a lot of baggage - (it does however handle early all vtk data types).



On another note : if you are only wanting live visualization, you might want to check out the coprocessing stuff, it is much easier to get working without documentation! Ours was intended for HDF5 enabled apps that want birectional communication, if you really need this, then we should take this off list an collaborate properly to get you going. (next week - not this!)





JB

One catch - the modified XdmfWriter does something unusual - it creates one dataset per process writing, so that parallel writes go into their own pieces - we wanted to preserve the spatial separation (decomposition) of data when writing in parallel - I'm actually changing this because for one current project we want a flat dataset combined using hyperslabs - not multiple blocks....anyway


//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// writes the currently selected object int the paraview GUI into the DSM
// using XdmfWriter in parallel
void pqDSMViewerPanel::onWriteDataToDSM()
{
  if (this->DSMReady()) {
    if (!this->Internals->ActiveSourceProxy) {
      vtkGenericWarningMacro(<<"Nothing to Write");
      return;
    }
    //
    vtkSMProxyManager* pm = vtkSMProxy::GetProxyManager();
    vtkSmartPointer<vtkSMSourceProxy> XdmfWriter =
      vtkSMSourceProxy::SafeDownCast(pm->NewProxy("icarus_helpers", "XdmfWriter4"));
    XdmfWriter->SetConnectionID(pqActiveObjects::instance().activeServer()->GetConnectionID());

    // Delete our reference now and let smart pointer clean up later
    XdmfWriter->UnRegister(NULL);

    pqSMAdaptor::setProxyProperty(
      XdmfWriter->GetProperty("DSMManager"), this->Internals->DSMProxy);

    pqSMAdaptor::setElementProperty(
      XdmfWriter->GetProperty("FileName"), "stdin"); // dummy non null filename, DSM is used

    pqSMAdaptor::setInputProperty(
      XdmfWriter->GetProperty("Input"),
      this->Internals->ActiveSourceProxy,
      this->Internals->ActiveSourcePort
      );

    XdmfWriter->UpdateVTKObjects();
    XdmfWriter->UpdatePipeline();
  }

Message-ID: <012732E1-1979-4059-8E04-13D683346134@u-paris10.fr>

Hi,

I use a second order quad and vtk file and I want to visualize the  
mesh. Actually, I have not only the edge of each element but also line  
connecting the mid-side nodes.
Is-it possible to see only the side on the element.

See the example associated: vtk file and pdf file of the visualisation  
in paraview.

Thank you for quick reply.
i succeeded to change the color bar.
Your advice was very helpful for me.

Do you have multiple versions of paraview  installed by any chance?

If you simply run pvpython executable and import paraview, does that work?

Sorry, no - I'm sure that there's only one version of paraview installed 
- the machine has a fresh Ubuntu 10.10 installation...

Thanks for your suggestion.

pvpython outputs exactly the same errors message as with 
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/paraview python

The error appears only the first time I try to load/import the module. 
Despite the error message, the module seems to be loaded. However, if I run:

servermanager.vtkSMObject.GetProxyManager().GetProxyDefinitionsUpdated()

I received:

Traceback (most recent call last):
 File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
AttributeError: GetProxyDefinitionsUpdated


Any ideas? Isn't this a bug (or is it ubuntu-related)?

Hi again,

Solved part of the problem:

Applying a Cell Centers filter and then the Glyphs gets me the results I 
was looking for.
The error message is still showing up though...

I doubt it's ubuntu related. This is stop ParaView 3.8.0 or did you
build it yourself?

Yes - the installed paraview is 100% a standard-package binary version 
installed through the graphical package manager that ships with ubuntu 
10.10 - I didn't build it myself, so there's no compile-options that 
could cause this problem...

To David: "So this is a package installed ParaView then"? Yes it is... 
(sorry I answered before but my email program came up with error message 
about the mailserver and after trying a couple of times, the mailprogram 
crashed and refused to send you the answer, so here's the answer - and I 
hope the mail-program will not complain this time...

Okay that explains it. I am not sure how the ubuntu mainter built the
3.8.0 binary. I just tried the binaries available on ParaView website
for 3.8.0 and there are no issues. I am guessing he somehow has
brought in a more recent servermanager.py than 3.8.0.

Solution would be to either use kitware binaries
(http://paraview.org/files/v3.8/), or locate and edit servermanager.py
manually to remove the offending line or wait for the next release.

Subject: [Paraview]  Reset Center of rotation button disabeld in PV 3.8.1
Message-ID: <4D36F712.7040508@onera.fr>

Hello.

Did anybody notice that? The "Reset center of rotation" button is greyed 
in PV 3.8.1 GUI. I get this both with Linux and Windows binaries from 
the PV download page.
However, the reset function seems now to be assumed by the "Show/Hide 
center of rotation" button.

Regards.

Subject: [Paraview] Drawing element Glyphs error
Message-ID: <4D36E4B0.7030302@GMail.com>

Hi,

When trying to draw a velocity field (simple square -> 4 points with 2 
triangles) using Glyphs I receive the following error:

qDrawShadeRect: Invalid parameters
qDrawShadeRect: Invalid parameters

Steps to reproduce:

- Open attached file with Paraview 3.8.1
- Open the attached file
- Click apply (shows the square)
- Click Glyphs (error messages are shown

If I click Apply for the Glyphs, 4 horizontal arrows (should be in a 
direction?) are shown at
each point (should be in each Cell...).


Is there something wrong with my input file, or is this a bug in Paraview?

Thanks for you help,

Luis Manuel

In the next version of ParaView, this behavior of the Surface With Edges representation will be fixed.  Only the actual edges will be drawn.  In addition there will be a parameter called "Subdivision" in the Display panel that will allow you to control how many linear polygons to use to approximate the quadratic elements.

Hi,

I use a second order quad and vtk file and I want to visualize the
mesh. Actually, I have not only the edge of each element but also line
connecting the mid-side nodes.
Is-it possible to see only the side on the element.

See the example associated: vtk file and pdf file of the visualisation
in paraview.

Hi all,


Thanks for your suggestions. Looks like it is an issue with ubuntu 
10.10, so I think I'll file it in as bug report. Just to show that I'm 
not the only one, I found this post with exactly the same problem by 
"Ken" on Nov. 24th:

http://www.mail-archive.com/paraview at paraview.org/msg10168.html

So now I want to tell ubuntu that they should please fix it - I'm not 
clever enough to do it myself (I think however I can use kitware 
binaries, if necessary). The only thing is, that I've never filed in bug 
reports to ubuntu before so I'm not quite sure I know where to do it. 
Maybe somebody on this list knows what to do? I found these pages:

https://launchpad.net/~techboard
https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BugSquad


Thanks again for your help (I'll still read here, if anyone has any 
further good suggestions - if I don't receive any answers, I think I'll 
just try to write to somebody on the above two links)...

tried to load an EnSight Server of Server file. This results in the

casefile: D:\2_proc\NO_Measured_data\DOM_1\Case02_v10023_DOM_1.case
==========================================================
The both case files are located according to the plce as defined in
the sos file.



Loading the data in EnSight is no problem.

Is this a bug in paraview or am I doing something wrong ?

Hi Albert,

Currently the .sos file must be in the same directory as the .case files for
the EnSight reader to work. Please submit a bug at
http://paraview.org/Bug about
this issue.

Hi,

It seems that the "Python Shell --> Run Script" functionnaltity does 
nothing currently, is it a known bug?
Rem : If I register the same script as a macro and call it, it works 
nicely.

Message-ID: <29924.84136.qm@web30408.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hi,

I am new in using ParaView 3.8.1 64-bit.

I have the vtu files for the data I need to visualize, I can generate an 
animation file, but I need a batch or a way that will enable me to extract this 
animation into picture files so that I can convert them to KMZ files.

Please let me know if you have any suggestions.

Thanks,
-Hussein

position in an animation?     I have an animation with 3DText where I 
would like the text orientation to follow the camera as the camera 
position moves.   I have read there are vtkFollower objects that can do 
this, but not sure how to implement it in paraview.

thanks,

Gerard

When saving an animation if you choose an image format ( jpg, png, or tiff )
it will save the animation as a series of picture files.

Thank you very much for this valuable information.

I wonder if there's a way that I can do the same in a command line steps or 
batch mode?

Thanks,

Subject: [Paraview] Paralel mpi run of Text rendering
Message-ID: <AANLkTimFE=6Q0vEGau3xD8eoMCSDJ5OTXmL2chPWfPz=@mail.gmail.com>

Dear paraview fellows,

I am trying to carry out a parallel rendering using paraview on our cluster.
I got it almost running except for one issue: rendering of Text fails.
Hopefully someone can advise me.

I followed the approach of the tuturial with the Sphere example (
http://www.cscs.ch/fileadmin/user_upload/customers/users_entry_point/HORUS_Doc/PvPython.pdf
)

So I added the renderview and ProcessIdScalars to all the Show() commands,
e.g.:

*RenderView1 = sm.CreateRenderView()
SurfaceVectors1 = SurfaceVectors(SelectInputVectors = ['POINTS', 'U'])
DataRepresentation5  = Show(ProcessIdScalars(SurfaceVectors1),RenderView1)
*
This works fine (also in parallel on 8 cores), except for the show of plain
Text with Text

There I had to remove the ProcessIdScalars function, so I do:


t=Text(Text=timestr)
Show(t,RenderView1,Color=[0.0,0.0,0.0],Position=[0.01,0.95],FontSize=15)

Now it works, even if I run it on 1 core on the cluster.
However, if I run it on 8 cores, I get the error message


*Process id: 0 >> ERROR: In
/scratch/ParaView-3.8.1/VTK/Filtering/vtkDemandDrivenPipeline.cxx, line 827
vtkCompositeDataPipeline (0x5fc3b80): Input for connection index 0 on input
port index 0 for algorithm vtkTransmitPolyDataPiece(0x5fc1ab0) is of type
vtkTable, but a vtkPolyData is required.*

Apperantly it is not allowed, it need information on the process Id I
suppose. However, ProcessIdScalars does not work. Is there anybody who would
know a solution?

Subject: Write a reader plugin

Hi David and all,
I am writing a reader plugin for ParaView. A test program without the VTK wrapping approves that I can get all the header (metadata) and grid data correctly. However, when I following the examples posted in http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/ParaView/Examples/Plugins/Reader
http://www.kitware.com/products/html/WritingAParaViewReaderPlug-in.html
and vtkStructuredGridReader.h/.cxx

I got confused. Shall I subclass vtkStructuredGridAlgorithm or vtkStructuredGridReader? What are the differences? With minor differences in the code, i.e. defining char* FileName, I have both scenarios built fine. 

Let's say, we are subclassing vtkStructuredGridAlgorithm for now on. After I populate values as the following

int vtkGRIB2Reader::RequestInformation(vtkInformation* vtkNotUsed(request), 								vtkInformationVector** vtkNotUsed(inputVector),							vtkInformationVector *outputVector)
{
	...
	vtkInformation* outInfo = outputVector->GetInformationObject(0);
	
	outInfo->Set(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::WHOLE_EXTENT(),	ext, 6);
	outInfo->Set(vtkDataObject::SPACING(),	this->Spacing, 3);
	outInfo->Set(vtkDataObject::ORIGIN(), 	this->Origin, 3);	

	return 1;
}

In ParaView Object Inspector / Information widget, I did not see any update in all the fields except Statistics / Type: Structured (Curvilinear) Grid. Would you please help me? Did I populate outInof in the wrong place? Thanks a lot.

Best,
xunlei

vtkStructuredGridReader is a vtkDataReader subclass. So, unless you
are writing a reader that reads a file similar to the legacy VTK
files, I'd simply subclass vtkStructuredGridAlgorithm making sure that
you set the NumberOfInputPorts to 0 in the constructor of your
subclass.

The information widget will only show any fields after you've hit
apply. Does it still now show anything? Is so, try putting a break
point in your RequestData() function, is that being called? Are you
producing valid data there? You might always want to verify that you
are reporting correct WHOLE_EXTENT() etc. in the RequestInformation
function.

Subject: [Paraview] XDMF with Temporal Collection,
 no time value - crashes ParaView (but loads in VisIt)
Message-ID: <4D39F2C8.7010903@stellarscience.com>

Hi,

We are using ParaView and VisIt to visualize some data in XDMF format.

I have a simple XDMF file (see below), which loads and shows in VisIt, 
but which crashes in ParaView. It seems to be crashing ParaView because 
the CollectionType='Temporal', but there are no timesteps defined. If I 
add a time value, e.g. <Time Value='0'></Time> inside the grid, then it 
does not crash.

But that begs the question:
- Is my Xdmf without the "<Time Value='0'>"a validly formed file, or am 
I just being lucky that VisIt can read it?

Jon

Thanks, Utkarsh.
I can certainly adopt the interface vtkDataReader requires. However, 
vtkDataReader and its subclasses are VTK internal structures, i.e. they 
cannot be positioned as plugins, as I discovered. (what shall be the 
correct/formal wording on this phenomenon?). So I guess I have to use 
vtkXXXAlgorithm in order to produce a run-time plugin, right?

I was hoping to write the reader reading in both the header/metadata 
before I click apply and then the heavy data after I click apply. The 
hit apply, RequestInformation() is certainly called. And WHOLD_EXTENT() 
is populated within RequestInformation() and I verified WHOLE_EXTENT() 
right after RequestInformation() is called as well.

Any suggestions? Oh, I did put 0 to NumberOfInputPorts.
Best,
x

Hi !

I want to use Paraview in my thesis work.

But I can't launch the software. I can see the Paraview logo and then the
windows "Paraview stop working" ( ? ) appears.

It seems to be a GPU probleme because when I unable the GPU Driver it works
fine.

I install Paraview<http://www.paraview.org/files/v3.8/ParaView-3.8.1-Win64-x86.exe>.
My Laptop works on Windows 7 64 with an ATI Mobility Radeon HD 5870.

Have you heard similar probleme ? And solution to fix it ? I look on the web
and find nothing.

Please Help !

Thank You !



ps: English is not my maternal language (French). Sorry It isn't

Once you have run through the steps to generate a coprocessing python
script, described here:

http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/CoProcessing#Running_the_CoProcessing_Script_Generator

If you look at the top of the generated script, it will have these options:

host = "localhost"
port = 22222

set_use_network(True)
set_do_reduce_data(True)
set_do_writing(False)
set_use_psets(False)
set_log_messages(False)
set_procs_per_partition(32)
set_final_partition_size(1)

So you just need to edit the two lines with host and port.  You can ignore
the other options, they are set by default to do the standard live-data use
case.  When you generate the coprocessing script, you will add writers to
the end of your pipeline(s).  A writer represents the end of the pipeline,
the sink.  Instead of data flowing into the writer, it will be re-directed
over the network to the Live Data Source on the pvserver.

If the number of coprocessor nodes is greater than the number of pvserver
nodes, then the coprocessor will have to aggregate data to a subset its
nodes that perform the network sends.  The aggregation code currently
expects vtkPolyData and won't work with anything else.

Subject: [Paraview] Parallel rendering of Text sources
Message-ID: <AANLkTimqDUJgzAbrg2hr5Ci6fYUD4QUJ=bS-YNhSBTKO@mail.gmail.com>

Dear paraviewers,

I am trying render in parallel a scene + text. Unfortunately: the
TextSourceRepresentation of the text does not work in parallel (is works in
serial)

If I do

sm=servermanager
sm.Connect()
RenderView1 = sm.CreateRenderView()
t=sm.sources.Text(Text="HELLO")
timerep=sm.CreateRepresentation(t,RenderView1,proxyName="TextSourceRepresentation")
RenderView1.StillRender()

in shows a label in serial, but if a run the script on more the 2 cores, I
get the mesaage

+++++++
 Process id: 1 >> ERROR: In
/scratch/ParaView-3.8.1/VTK/Filtering/vtkDemandDrivenPipel     49 ine.cxx,
line 827
     50 vtkCompositeDataPipeline (0xdce1a0): Input for connection index 0 on
input port index     50  0 for algorithm vtkTransmitPolyDataPiece(0xdcca20)
is of type vtkTable, but a vtkPol     50 yData is required.
++++++++

An alternative way I found leads to the same problem if I do

 timerep=sm.rendering.TextSourceRepresentation(Input=t)
RenderView1.Representations.append(timerep)

I have found that more people had problems with TextSourceRepresentation in
parallel :

http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2008-April/007550.html

Apparently there was a bug found in 2008. Does anybody if in the new version
3.81 this bug is still present ? What would I need to do to fix the bug.

Any comments and hints appreciated !
Many thanks

Not sure about 3.8.1, but it's definitely fixed in the development
version and will be for the upcoming release 3.10.0. The release
candidate binaries should be available for download in the next few
days.

Hi,

I just found this page and wonder, if this will be a new approach for 
python scripting:

http://www.paraview.org/ParaView3/index.php/Visualization_Script_Examples#Paraview_Python_Script_with_PVFWrap

In addition, there are comments about the VisIt way... do you plan 
something like this!?

No. PVFWrap was a prototype interface that has been substantially improved to become the current paraview.simple. Most people use the python trace to establish their initial python scripts and then modify them, but if you know the names of the filters and only want to specify changes from default values for properties, you can script "from scratch" without using python trace.

I don't know anything about plans to implement VisIt's python interface in ParaView.

That page is ancient.

I think PVFWrap was the predecessor to paraview.simple which since 3.6
is the standard way to do ParaView python scripting (see python
trace).
The comments about paraview state files being too verbose have been
addressed since then as well.

Or did you mean something else?

Hello,

thanks for the info!
Is my impression correct, that in version 3.8.1 the python trace state 
process is not as 'complete' as using the old state file approach?
For my case setup, e.g. there is not always the correct camera position 
and the correct slices...

Best Regards!
Fabian

Hi Fabian,

Regarding your issue of python trace state not replicating your paraview
state exactly, I believe both issues you quote (camera position and cut
filter's slice property) have been addressed in the latest version of
paraview.  If not, can you list the steps required to repeat the problem?  I
can't find bug reports for these issues, but below I have copied the git
logs for the commits the addressed the issues.

Pat

commit f3f73df79fe4ca377297885c4c71bcba661b165d
Author: Pat Marion <pat.marion at kitware.com>
Date:   Tue May 18 14:50:17 2010 -0400

    BUG: Add method to disable the first render ResetCamera.

    Added python method paraview.simple._DisableFirstRenderResetCamera()
    and included it at the top of all generated trace scripts.  This is
    tested by PythonSMTraceTest1 since I removed the extra 'Render()'
    call from the test which was there to work around the issue.

commit d9119f6be4b10b97b18fc2a2d5232788363d3fc9
Author: Pat Marion <pat.marion at kitware.com>
Date:   Fri Apr 30 13:35:03 2010 -0400

    BUG: Group helper proxies with the proxy using the helper.

    For example, now 'my_slice.SliceType.Normal' is mapped to my_slice
    instead of the SliceType helper proxy.  Now when you trace state,
    the helper proxy's properties are grouped with the parent proxy.
    Previously all helper proxy properties were listed at the very
    end of the trace, and that was incorrect.

You are using 3.8.0, not 3.8.1.  If you use 3.8.1 to generate the trace
script you will not receive these errors.


Your script can also be fixed by hand-  editing test_trace.py and move the
lines at the very bottom modifying Slice1, Slice2 and Slice3.   Moving the
lines up so they appear after the constructors of Slice1, Slice2, and
Slice3.

Utkarsh,

Thanks for your quick reply. I am running an own build paraview 3.8.1
version (with MESA and mpi, so pvbatch only). So the problem has been solved
in the git version. Is the source release of a stable 3.10 version also to
be expected within a few date ? Then I would wait for that release instead
of installing the git version.
Regards,

Eelco

Hi Mike,

There is now an advanced option PARAVIEW_FIXUP_BUNDLE_SEARCH_PATHS that you
can append directories for fixup bundle to search.

Almost forgot about this.

PARAVIEW_EXTRA_INSTALL_RULES_FILE now can be set to multiple semicolon
separated files that will be looped over and included. Please let me know if
you experience any issues.

Message-ID: <392376.41621.qm@web30406.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hi,
I am trying to generate Paraview images in batch mode from command line, I used 
the trace in the Python shell but it didn't record the saving options for the 
animation at the end in the script.

I am wondering if someone knows how to to convert the process into script and 
how to run the script in the command-line!

Thanks,
-Hussein

Hussein,

That's a known issue:http://paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=11744

It should be resolved by 3.10.1. In the meantime, to see how to save
animation from Python, refer to :

Oh, sorry... at work I got 3.8.1, I mixed this up. I thought that I had

Subject: [Paraview] histogram
Message-ID: <AANLkTimMFHwt5pSYv0naQXMp1i3a6rTcyvfFL+mf0gMg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,
I have a CSV file per snapshot which contains two large columns of
data. I'd like to make histogram of those data. The idea is to have
the animation of the histogram + the main visualisation in the same
frame.
I don't know how to build the input data needed for the histogram filter.
Does anyone have an idea?

Best,
Nima

Subject: [Paraview] Problem with Xdmf/HyperSlab
Message-ID: <4D400774.5010107@tp4.rub.de>

Hello,

either the implementation of the HyperSlab Itemtype, or my grasp of it is corrupted. To illustrate the problem which I am getting, see the attached XDMF file (no HDF5 needed, just plain XML), which is supposed to cut a 2x2x2 cube out of a larger 3x3x3x cube. My issues:
1. To extract the subgrid [0,1]^3 from the larger [0,2]^3 grid, I set the start-stride-count in the first DataItem to
 0 0 0
 1 1 1
 2 2 2
 in analogy to the example from [www.xdmf.org/index.php/XDMF_Model_and_Format], but this causes Paraview to crash. ("*** glibc detected *** ... realloc(): invalid next size: 0x0000000008e1a800 ***")
The same happens if I try to access the opposite corner [1,2]^3 (the one with values in the [8,15] range) using
 1 1 1
 1 1 1
 2 2 2
2. I can apparently avoid the crash using ranges whose count values are at least 3 (which should obviously be too large for the 2x2x2 target grid), and even grossly out-of-bound values such as
 12 11 321
 1 1 1
 6 13 13
are accepted without complaints, and result in something that from visual inspection looks like
 1 2 0 3 4 0 0 0
i.e. a copy of the beginning of the source array.

Can anybody explain to me what is going on here?
Any hint would be apprechiated.

Best, Jens.
PS: I have tried to get help from the Xdmf mailing list (so far without any response), but since this potentialle concerns both [Paraview] and [Xdmf] (and this list is apparently more active), I post this here again.

Hi Fabian,

Please remember to include the paraview mailing list when you reply.

What you report is a bug, but you can avoid it- when you open your openfoam
dataset you should check each block that you want to load *before you hit
apply for the first time*

The problem is the first time you load your data and click apply, paraview
sees a multiblock dataset containing only unstructured grid data, so it
creates an unstructured grid display.  This display has properties related
to volume rendering, and these properties are recorded in the trace script.
Later you must have enabled more blocks, so that multiblock dataset now
contains unstructured grid and polydata.  When the trace script is replayed,
paraview sees the unstructured grid and polydata datasets, so it creates a
geometry display instead of an unstructured grid display.  The geometry
display lacks the volume rendering properties.

Pat

Subject: [Paraview] histogram
In-Reply-To: <AANLkTimMFHwt5pSYv0naQXMp1i3a6rTcyvfFL+mf0gMg@mail.gmail.com>
References: <AANLkTimMFHwt5pSYv0naQXMp1i3a6rTcyvfFL+mf0gMg@mail.gmail.com>

The Histogram filter requires a vtkDataSet on its input. vtkTable is
not one since Tables have no inherent shape in a 3D space.

The Table To Points and Table To Structured Grid filters convert
vtkTables to vtkDataSets, but in either case you need to tell the
filter which columns from the table it can use for the x,y and z
coordinates of the vtkDataSet. A hackish way to do the conversion then
is to add a column of dummy data to the file and then make a 1D
vtkDataSet out of it.

Feel free though to add a request for something more direct on user
voice and we will consider adding it to upcoming ParaView releases.

I can hack in a rule for HDF5 but a much cleaner approach would be to track which "_USE_SYSTEM_*" variables are set and loop over those to setup the correct directories. Or did I just completely miss something?

Hi,

Anyone have an idea why the trace python shell don't record the zooming position 
and the images are not saved in the specified area! Any solution for that?

Thanks,

Hi Hussein,

Could you elaborate on the problem you are experiencing?  I'm not sure what
you mean when you say that the images are not saved in the specified area.
As for zooming position, python trace should record camera properties such
as position, focal point, and parallel scale depending if you are using
parallel or perspective projection.

Pat,

I am trying to save an animation happening on a map. So I record the trace, and 
use the button "zoom to box" and chose the specified area on the map; say the 
map is for North America and the specified Area if for Gulf of Mexico.

When I run the script, it saved the images for the whole map North of America 
-zoom out you can say- not Gulf of Mexico.

Hi,

Which version of paraview are you using?  This bug should not occur in the
latest paraview release.  If you are using 3.8.0 you will need to upgrade.
After the upgrade you'll need to re-record the trace script.  Or, you can
fix your existing trace script by adding a call to Render() before the
camera position is set.

Would anyone have any knowledge of how to control the frame rendering 
rate when saving an animation?    I notice that if I make an animation 
at 5  - 10 fps, the resulting avi file looks perfect.   However, if I 
use the same animation sequence and render at 20 - 30 fps, the resulting 
avi file has many holes and greyed out areas in the frames beginning 
about half way through the animation.

I'm wondering if it is possible for the frame rendering to get far 
enough ahead of the IO writing to disk such that frame information can 
be lost?    If the buffer that is holding the frames renders fills up,  
wouldnt it wait for IO writing to disk to catch up first?

If you want to email me the trace script I'd be happy to take a look.  It
looks like an unwanted camera reset is ocuring.

Maybe you could try writing individual images, and then stitch them together using some free software?  As far as the individual frames goes, try opening up the Animation View, change the mode to Sequence, and the number of frames to 200.  Next, try Filters/ Temporal/ Temporal Interpolator.

If this doesn't save properly, please let me know what type of data you are using, and I will look into it.

Alan

Scott, thank you.

I am already working in sequence mode.    The data I am working with is 
lunar data from the lunar reconnaissance orbiter  LRO.   I am taking 
data from the laser altimeter instrument on the spacecraft which is at 
very high resolution and constructing the lunar surface topography and 
then using data from another instrument, a neutron spectrometer which 
can give us an idea where the hydrogen (water) is located, overlaying 
that data on the surface and coloring by it.

I made animations on a 32 bit windows machine last fall in a similar 
fashion using lower resolution data with great success and no 
troubles.   I am using a 64 bit machine now with 12 gb of ram,  which is 
why I was wondering could the rendering be getting way ahead of the 
writing to disc, not waiting for some buffer to be ready.

I've read in the manual about the temporal interpolater but not sure how 
to apply this to an animation.    I have about 7 camera positions and am 
doing a slow orbit about the north pole of the moon.    The camera 
positions appear to be interpolated just fine.    It's simply that if I 
render a few thousand frames,   midway through the resulting avi, there 
are frames where data seems to be lost.

thanks again,

If you want to email me the trace script I'd be happy to take a look.  It looks

Subject: [Paraview] XDMF data set not showing, or crashes
Message-ID: <4D419791.1000003@stellarscience.com>

Hi,

We have a 2D Uniform grid data set in XDMF format that we are trying to 
visualize with ParaView. The data is stored in a 1MB HDF5 data set. The 
(light) meta xdmf file is attached to this email.

I am seeing some problems when trying to load the data-- usually 
ParaView either crashes, or the data does not show. I have tried the PV 
3.8.1 Windows binaries as well as building ParaView from source that I 
pulled a few days ago from the git://paraview.org/ParaView.git repository.

After loading the data and hitting Apply, the 3D render window will be 
empty. What I've noticed is that the Y-range of the Bounds will 
sometimes be extremely large. For example here is a snapshot from the 
Information tab:


Are these known issues with ParaView?

Or perhaps the data is mal-formed, I am new to XDMF, so it'd help to know if there is an error in the .xmf file.

HDF5 tools like HDFView and h5dump don't report any anomalies on the HDF5 file that goes with the heavy data.

thanks

I am using version 3.8.1 64bit
Attached 2 pictures, Pic1 is what I want and record the trace for, Pic2 is the 
outcome of the script.
I can't figure out why the trace script outcome is different from what is 
expected to be!!

Hi,

Which version of paraview are you using?  This bug should not occur in the 
latest paraview release.  If you are using 3.8.0 you will need to upgrade.  
After the upgrade you'll need to re-record the trace script.  Or, you can fix 
your existing trace script by adding a call to Render() before the camera 
position is set.

Hey Jon,

I've never tried to use VxVyVz type geometry before, but I wonder whether it's some sort of problem with you trying to specify polar coordinates when it's expecting XYZ? You might want to play with a smaller sample file that just uses light data first, and then if you get that working you can make sure the same sort of arrays exist in your HDF5 file. Here's a sample that I modified from one of the standard Xdmf example data files (and which loads in ParaView 3.8.1 fine on my machine):

<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<!DOCTYPE Xdmf SYSTEM "Xdmf.dtd" []>
<Xdmf xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" Version="2.0">

Subject: [Paraview] A bunch of novice user questions
Message-ID: <16BF276E-EF2F-43C5-9366-B1253CDC9783@gmail.com>

Dear all.

My name is Paulo Neves and I am starting to use Paraview. I already did the great Kenneth Moreland tutorial.
I downloaded and installed Paraview on a Mac OS X machine through the binary dmg, running in standalone mode. Version is 3.8.1.

Here are my questions:
When trying to open a .raw data set, such as the one in attach, I get errors, like
ERROR: In /Users/partyd/Kitware/ParaView-3.8/src/VTK/IO/vtkImageReader.cxx, line 184
vtkMPIImageReader (0x126f74e70): File operation failed: 18446744073709512510, ext: 0, 32, 0, 32, 0, 32

The first thing that strikes me is where is /Users/partyd directory! I cannot find this on my machine.
Second the dataset is 32x32x32, 8bit so why the errors?

This leads me to another question: where is the source VTK files (like vtkImageReader) on my machine? Do I need to download the source and compile it to have access to this? Later on I would like to create my own algorithms, so I will need to extend Paraview. Isn't the best way to write such code through VTK?

Sorry for my newbie questions and thanks for your patience!

Kind regards,

See below.

That is an artifact of the release packaging processes, you can safely
ignore that. /Users/partyk/Kitware ... is just the directory where
that binary image was originally built and it gets encoded into things
like the error strings by the compiler.

> Second the dataset is 32x32x32, 8bit so why the errors?

Try extents of 0..31 0..31 0..31. You and ParaView are disagreeing on
whether to count cells or points. It works fine on my 3.8.1 binary
image.

> This leads me to another question: where is the source VTK files (like

The binaries do not include the source code. If you want to make c++
extensions to ParaView you have to download or git clone that
separately.

> it to have access to this? Later on I would like to create my own
> algorithms, so I will need to extend Paraview. Isn't the best way to write

Yes. It is almost always better to learn VTK data structures and
filter concepts first, then wrap your VTK level code so that ParaView
will include it. At the core ParaView is just a front end for VTK .

No problem and good luck!

Hi Eric,

I don't think it's a polar coordinates issue -- the data happens to 
originate from a polar system, but (in theory) is merely mapped to a 
Cartesian system via the Uniform 2DRectMesh.

I too had your idea of "play with a smaller sample file that just uses 
light data" -- and my simple tests, and the standard Xdmf example file 
you provided below also loads fine for me in ParaView. But thanks for 
the suggestion, and I may need to go further down this path to help 
figure out if it's the data per se, or some other combination of 
HDF5/XDMF/ParaView.

cheers,
Jon

Dear David.

Thank you very much!

The problem was the selection of the data scalar data type.

Hi Pat,

Sorry for this late reply. Good to hear there is a concrete plan to
merge the live data source to the mainline. Until then, if possible
rebasing onto one of the upcoming releases (say 3.10) would be
appreciated. That way we can explore the feature on top of a stable
basis.

p.s. I thought I could write and post a brief guide to build/setup the
live data source but time still has not yet allowed me...

Subject: [Paraview] rotate
Message-ID: <4D42CCE0.1010805@knmi.nl>

Dear ParaView Users,

I have a question over the camera rotation in Paraview. Since I normally 
visualize Earth system data. The global should rotate from east to west, 
but ParaView rotate automatically from west to east. My question is 
whether it is possible to rotate the other way round?

Thanks!

Good day,

I'm trying to build the latest git on Mac and getting this error :

I never experienced that before. Note that I successfully built it under Linux.

Subject: [Paraview] python script  and  axis
Message-ID: <20110128144441.203900@gmx.net>

Hello!

I'm a newbie on python and VTK. 

I would like to add axis notation in my figure, but it fails, there are never represented. No error output occurs by running the script. Please could somebody help me to set up a correct script? Thanks in advance!

Below you can find an abstract of my script. I hope it's not overloaded. 

Since it is quite difficult to find a comprehensive documentation about all the options of "CubeAxesRepresentation" by using google, could someone send me a link? Thanks as well!


vtkreader = LegacyVTKReader(FileNames=INPUTFILE)
Show()

dp = GetDisplayProperties(vtkreader)
[...]

view = GetActiveView()
[...]

camera = GetActiveCamera()
p = camera.GetPosition()
camera.Zoom(1.5)
camera.SetWindowCenter(+.2,0.0)

axes = servermanager.rendering.CubeAxesRepresentation(Input=vtkreader)
axes.Visibility = 1 
axes.Color = [1,1,1]
axes.SetPosition((p[0],p[1],p[2]))
axpos = axes.GetPosition()
view.Representations.append(axes)

Dear Paraview users,

Using Paraview on windows, with the usefull plugin surfaceLIC, I can not see
the options of Line Integral Convolution in the display pannel, such as "Use
LIC when using LOD" or choosing the vector to use...

Has soemone already face this ?

What version of ParaView are you using? Did you load the plugin before
loading your dataset? It is essential that the plugin was loaded
before the data was shown in any view. If that's not the case, you can
close the view and create a new one after you load the plugin.

I see that changes were made to the code, thank you, I can compile now !

I have noted in the last few versions that the client/server mode has brought back
a bad habit very similar to that : http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2010-January/015174.html
where the server re-stream the data as soon as the client does an action (pan, zoom, rotate). I'm attaching the output
from the time log below.

Subject: [Paraview] Problem with Xdmf/HyperSlab

Hi Jens,

I'm not super solid on using the HyperSlab functionality of XDMF but I
wonder if some of the issue might be about how you're currently
specifying your grid topology and then mapping the scalar data onto
the grid.

Based on the XDMF specs you should have a NumberOfElements attribute
in your Topology rather than a Dimensions attribute which is used for
describing the arrangement of underlying data in DataItem tags.

So for you I think you'll need:

<Topology TopologyType="3dCoRectMesh" NumberOfElements ="3 3 3"/>

In combination with your origin and DxDyDz this should give you a mesh
which goes from [0,2]^3.

With that same idea in mind for the basic scalar data "dat_01" unless
you do something nifty with Hyperslabs (or other methods to map data
across the mesh) I think you need to give data elements for ALL the
Nodes you have in the underlying mesh.  Therefore, you'll need
something like

     <Attribute Name="dat_01" AttributeType="Scalar" Center="Node">
       <DataItem Dimensions="3 3 3" NumberType="Float" Format="XML">
            1  2  3
            4  5  6
            7  8  9

            1  2  3
            4  5  6
            7  8  9

            1  2  3
            4  5  6
            7  8  9
       </DataItem>
     </Attribute>

Which gives a scalar value to each node in the 27 node [0,2]^3 array.
In my experience if you don't specify a value for a node the result is
pretty erratic in PV. F For example when I left out the last layer of
nodes I got a data range of [0, 1.77323e+28] in PV.

Sorry I can't be more help with the hyperslabs, maybe someone else
will be able to help there.

Dan

Hi Dan,

first off, you are absolutely right about your comment on the Topology syntax: It needs a "NumberOfElements" tag, not "Dimensions". Unfortunately, changing just that does not help.
You are also right in noting that values for all grid points need to be provided, else PV will fill in numerical garbage. But the point is, the _target_ array is deliberately just [0,1]^3 with eight nodes, therefore the dat_01 and dat_02 attributes only need (and in fact do) specify eight values. "dat_hyper" is larger: [0,2]^3 with the same spacing, hence consisting of 3^3=27 values, but I only wish to use its [0,1]^3 subset on the grid (that's what the HyperSlab is supposed to be good for), the rest should never get displayed. In fact, to reproduce the crash, you could as well delete the dat_01 and dat_02 Attributes, they are just for illustrative purposes.

But thanks anyway for your reply.
Jens.

Subject: [Paraview] Problem with Xdmf/HyperSlab

Greetings,

after spending a couple of days trying to figure out the proper usage of XDMF HyerSlabs, and with no progress whatsoever, things are starting to get frustrating.
I have a 3-D curvilinear grid with scalar data, and I need to cut out a sub-grid (in order to discard the boundary). The HyperSlab should do this, but I fail with every try. The smallest example file which reproduces the problem is at [http://www.tp4.rub.de/~jk/science/hyperslab_mintest.xmf]. I have tried various combinations, but I get crashes on Linux, crashes on Windows (using 3.8.1. 64bit, not necessarily for the same cases), and whenever I manage to load it without a crash, the spreadsheet view indicates that the contents of the source array is just copied element-wise to the target array, disregarding the contents of the HyperSlab's first DataItem. (To verify this, increase the count values to from "2 2 2" to something like "2 2 20", and load into PV.)
The ability to extract brick-shaped subgrids from larger grids of the same type is absolutely essential to my application. I would very much like to use Paraview for my purposes, but this problem, and the apparent lack of resources which could provide at least a hint towards a solution, is a no-go.
Stripping boundary values does not seem an overly exotic task, so I guess someone must have done it in the past.
I would be particularly great if someone from the developers could be convinced to have a brief look at it.
Any hint would be most welcomed. Anyone...?

Jens.

Good morning,

I tested different scenarios using OpenFOAM cases and found out that this problem
happens when a "patch" is selected / I don't have the same issue when I'm working
with all the cells.

Regards,

PO

Subject: No subject
Message-ID: <mailman.19.1296833045.4183.paraview@paraview.org>

However, I noticed that operations as simple as multiplication by a constant are tricky: In Paraview 3.8.1,

Function=" 2.3 * $0 "

will apparently multiply the DataItem referenced by $0 by the _integer_ part of the constant factor (2.0 in this case)! This is especially nasty if you plan to multiply by something between 0 and 1, which will consequently reduce all values of $0 to zero. The same seems to apply to *division* by a non-integer constant.
A multiplication by, say, 1.5 can be achieved using something like

Function=" $0 * (3/2) " or Function=" ($0 / 2)*3" .

Note also that things like

Function=" (1.2+0.1) * $0 "

will segfault (at least on my machine).
The XMDF file quoted below may serve to illustrate this issue.

If this problem can be confirmed, I propose to at least add a corresponding comment to the XDMF wiki.

Cheers, Jens.

Alrighty, I will make sure to do that. I think the best option is to do a p=

I am certainly up for recommendations otherwise. Thanks<BR>

Alrighty, I will make sure to do that. I think the best option is to do a p=

I am certainly up for recommendations otherwise. Thanks<BR>
