Subject: [Paraview] Question about building reader plugin
Message-ID: <245222690903312328k4ff6579btde2950f7e46ba1a4@mail.gmail.com>

Hello, everyone!
I am trying to build my own reader into ParaView as a plugin. But after I
put my source file and XML files and the CMakeLists file into the specific
directory and I used CMake to build it. Then I open the sln file it created.
I just choose ALL_BUILD and I ran to many errors like below:

error C2504: 'vtkIamgeAlgorithm' : base class undefined
 error C2440: 'static_cast' : cannot convert from 'vtkObjectBase *' to
'vtkSgnReader *'
error C2440: 'return' : cannot convert from 'vtkSgnReader *' to
'vtkObjectBase *'
'GetDebug' : is not a member of 'vtkSgnReader'
'GetClassName' : is not a member of 'vtkSgnReader'
.....
.....
error C2664: 'vtkIamgeAlgorithmCommand' : cannot convert parameter 2 from
'vtkSgnReader *' to 'vtkObjectBase *

And here is my header file:
#ifndef __vtkSgnReader_h_
#define __vtkSgnReader_h_

#include "vtkImageAlgorithm.h"
#include "vtkSgn.h"               //Needed for read actual META_DATA

class VTK_EXPORT vtkSgnReader : public vtkIamgeAlgorithm
{
public:
    static vtkSgnReader* New();
    vtkTypeRevisionMacro(vtkSgnReader, vtkImageAlgorithm);
    void PrintSelf(ostream& os, vtkIndent indent);

    vtkSetStringMacro( FileName );
    vtkGetStringMacro( FileName );
    virtual int ReadMetaData(vtkInformation* *outInfo);
protected:
    vtkSgnReader();
    ~vtkSgnReader();

    virtual int RequestData(vtkInformation *, vtkInformationVector **,
                            vtkInformationVector *);
    virtual int RequestInformation(vtkInformation *, vtkInformationVector

Isn't your problem that you want a vtkImageAlgorithm and not a
vtkIamgeAlgorithm ???
Seems like a typo to me....

Subject: [Paraview] plugin reader confusion
Message-ID: <e572e6730904010047x7aea11dr6a5412c4378bd09d@mail.gmail.com>

 I'm trying to add a customized reader into ParaView 3.4.0. I have followed
the instructions on
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView:Build_And_Installand
successfully compiled my own version of PV 3.4.0. I have also created
the necessary files according to
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Plugin_HowTofor my new reader, including
MyReader.xml, MyReaderGUI.xml, MyReader.cxx,
MyReader.h, and CMakeLists.txt. These I have located in a directory
C:\ParaView\3.4.0\Plugins\MyPlugin where C:\ParaView\3.4.0\ is my build
directory for PV.

What I don't understand is how to actually create the plugin from all of
this. I'm working on Windows and have Visual Studio 2005 as my compiler. I
have tried using CMake with the source code location as
C:\ParaView\3.4.0\Plugins\MyPlugin but it seems to revert to
C:\ParaView\3.4.0\ when it actually runs. It seems that the issue is getting
my plugin recognized as a "project" inside VS2005 so I can make it into a
.dll file, which in turn can be used by PV.

I would appreciate any help on this problem.

Hello!
I just fixed my reader code and rebuild it as a plugin again! And I ran to
these errors:

LINK : fatal error LNK1181: can not open the input file "pqComponents.lib?

LINK : fatal error LNK1181:  can not open the input file

Message-ID: <245222690904010454r2cea938bx2c152444a0821da6@mail.gmail.com>

Hello, everyone!
I am writing my custom reader for my data format.I wrote it and Built it
with some errors!
So I have some questions to ask for help!
Basic information:
My output data type is vtkImageData, so my code was deriven form
vtkImageAlgorithm
1.Should I use *FillInputPortInformation *or *FillOutputPortInformation *like
below

int vtkMyPluginReader::FillOutputPortInformation(int, vtkInformation *info)
{
    info->Set(vtkDataObject::DATA_TYPE_NAME(), "vtkImageData");
    return 1;
}

*or*

int vtkMyPluginReader::FillInputPortInformation(int, vtkInformation *info)
{
  info->Set(vtkAlgorithm::INPUT_REQUIRED_DATA_TYPE(), "vtkImageAlgorithm");
  return 1;
}
*Which one is right when I am writing a reader NOT a filter?*

2.My header is like that below. Is that enough for a reader?:
//----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#ifndef __vtkMyPluginReader_h_
#define __vtkMyPluginReader_h_

#include "vtkImageAlgorithm.h"
#include "vtkMyPlugin.h"               //Needed for read actual META_DATA

class VTK_EXPORT vtkMyPluginReader : public vtkImageAlgorithm
{
public:
    static vtkMyPluginReader *New();
    vtkTypeRevisionMacro(vtkMyPluginReader, vtkImageAlgorithm);
    void PrintSelf(ostream& os, vtkIndent indent);

    vtkSetStringMacro( FileName );
    vtkGetStringMacro( FileName );

    virtual int ReadMetaData(vtkInformation *outInfo);//Get the actual data
from a data file

protected:
    vtkMyPluginReader();
    ~vtkMyPluginReader();

    virtual int RequestData(vtkInformation *, vtkInformationVector **,
                            vtkInformationVector *);

    virtual int RequestInformation(vtkInformation *, vtkInformationVector
**,
                                   vtkInformationVector *);

    virtual int FillOutputPortInformation(int, vtkInformation *);

public:
    vtkMyplugin pluginfile;
    char *FileName;

private:
    vtkMyPluginReader(const vtkMyPluginReader&);      //Not implemented
    void operator=(const vtkMyPluginReader&);   //Not implemented
};
#endif
//----------------------------------------------------------------------------


Thank you so much for helping me!

You've started the correct way, since you are writing a reader that
produces a vtkImageData, you should indeed begin by subclassing
vtkImageAlgorithm. Now, if you look that the implementation of
vtkImageAlgorithm, you'll see that it overloads both the
FillInputPortInformation and FillOutputPortInformation and fills it up
so that the executive knows that this algorithm requires and produces
vtkImageData. So you don;'t need to override either of the two
methods.

Since this is a reader, it will take no input. To tell the executive
that, you simply need to call

this->SetNumberOfInputPorts(0);

in the constructor of your class.

Is the ParaView you are building against also a "Release" build?

Can you post your CMakeList.txt file that you created for your plugin?

I have attached the CMakeLists.txt file. Also, it seems that part of the
problem is that my build of PV didn't originally have open libraries. This
first build was "debug." I compiled a new one overnight with open libraries
as a "release" but this one will not open.

Hi Thorsten, 

I just tried that and it is now giving me a segmentation fault... I am using the following line: 
file.write(reinterpret_cast<const char*>(size), 4);

My size is calculated as - int size = idim*jdim*sizeof(float). idim is currently in the region of 400 and jdim 200. I am outputting big files and it is likely to get bigger.

Also, I intend to include more data arrays each timestep, I just want to get it working with pressure first and then I will include then which is why I want to calculate the offset... I assuming it is just the number of bytes to the start of the next datafield...

Thanks David

Hello David,

the offset parameter is relevant if you append mulitple data sections into a single file.
Every DataArray tag with append format specifies the offset as the position in the 
binary data in bytes.
To write the integer I use the following:

std::ofstream os; // binary mode (for windows ...) ofstream to your file
int N; // size in bytes
os.write(reinterpret_cast<const char*>(N), 4);

  Hi Thorsten,

  That's really helpful. I don't quite know how to write out the number of bits as a char? If you could explain a way of how to do that it would be greatly appreciated. 

  Also, how do I calculate what value goes in for the offset? I had a look at a couple of output files from paraview and it wasnt obvious how it was calculated.

  Thanks
  David

  Hello,

  the solution might be to append your data as

  < DataArray ... format="appended">
  </DataArray>
  < AppendedData encoding="raw">
  _NNNNData 
  </AppendedData>
  where you should replace NNNN with a four 
  byte integer containing the number of bytes 
  in the data array as 4 chars.
  Setting the encoding to "raw" tells ParaView, that
  the data is simply a stream of bytes rather than 
  base64 encoded.
  If you want to write Image I can supply a small
  writer project for 2D data.

    Hello,

    I am currently trying to write my own quick output routine to generate a 
    binary file using C++. I am currently trying to avoid having to use the vtk 
    libraries because I only need a very basic output that doesn't change much. 
    I so far have the ASCII output working no problem but I can't get the binary 
    working.

    I am using file.write() function to output the binary data and that seems to 
    be working no problem and when used in a legacy format application it works 
    perfectly except that the data is LittleEndian instead of BigEndian. That's 
    why I have moved to BigEndian because I don't want to have to make the 
    output routine for the data anymore complicated that file.write.

    I started using the xml format and considering my output is raw binary and 
    not base64 I changed it to be in the AppendedData section instead of 
    DataArray. It still isn't working right, I get the following error when I 
    try to load in ParaView:

    ERROR: In ..\..\..\ParaView3\VTK\IO\vtkXMLStructuredDataReader.cxx, line 349
    vtkXMLImageDataReader (0ADEC7F8): Error reading extent 0 422 0 242 0 1 from 
    piece 0


    ERROR: In ..\..\..\ParaView3\VTK\IO\vtkXMLDataReader.cxx, line 537
    vtkXMLImageDataReader (0ADEC7F8): Cannot read cell data array "pressure" 
    from PointData in piece 0.  The data array in the element may be too short.

    The format of my output file is as follows:

    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <VTKFile type="ImageData" version="0.1" byte_order="LittleEndian">
    <ImageData WholeExtent="0 422 0 242 0 1" Origin="0 0 0" Spacing="1 1 1">
    <Piece Extent="0 422 0 242 0 1">
    <PointData>
    </PointData>
    <CellData Scalars="pressure">
    <DataArray type="Float32" Name="pressure" format="appended" offset="0"/>
    </CellData>
    </Piece>
    </ImageData>
    <AppendedData encoding="raw">
    _BINARYDATA
    </AppendedData>
    </VTKFile>

    Note following an error message I have added an _ at the start of the binary 
    data. Is this required?

    One final thing, when using appended data, how do you calculate what the 
    offset should be?

    Thanks
    David

I thought my C code may be helpful to you. I have 5 data array of different
size, and I do like this:

nvar=5;
/* Bytes and offsets for ParaView file */
    bytes[0] = (ndim*nnod)*sizeof(float);     /* Coordinates */
    bytes[1] = (nenod*nelmt)*sizeof(int);     /* Connectivity */
    bytes[2] = (nelmt)*sizeof(int);         /* Offsets */
    bytes[3] = (nelmt)*sizeof(int);         /* Types */
    bytes[4] = (nelmt)*sizeof(float);         /* Cell data */

    off[0]=0; /* 1st offset */
    for (i=0; i<nvar; i++){
        if(i<nvar-1)off[i+1]=off[i]+sizeof(int)+bytes[i];
        bytes[i]=bytes[i]+sizeof(int); /* For each byte we must also add the
sizeof(int) for itself also */
    }

Yes, both ParaView and the plugin must be of the same build configuration.

The segfault isn't surprising. If you obtain the address of the variable
first, I suspect you'll be much happier:

  int size;
  file.write(reinterpret_cast<const char*>(&size), sizeof(size));

Subject: [Paraview] Dataset name in a MultiBlock dataset and display of
 unstructured grid
In-Reply-To: <E34B647509ED144F860435CD5CAA8600483351@MAIL23.student.main.ntu.edu.sg>
Message-ID: <C5F8D5D3.798A%kmorel@sandia.gov>

I don't know what the problem is with the reader reading one block at a time so long as only the data for a given block is read in at one time.  This is not all that different than iteratively reading the data for each time step during an animation, and that is what every reader in ParaView that supports time does.

Still, if you don't like that and you already have a reader and extract filter that are working to your satisfaction, my approach would probably be to write a third component that internally uses the reader and filter to perform the operation in one step.  In its constructor it would create the reader and filter and hook them up.  It would forward all its ivars (like filename and selected block) to the internal reader and filter.  In the RequestData call it would call Update on the internal filter and then shallow copy the internal filter's output to its own output.  If you are careful, the pipeline update mechanism will prevent the internal reader from re-executing unnecessarily.

Hi, Ken
        Thanks for your reply.

        Yes, i am using my own reader. Currently all the blocks are constructed in the reader. And all the blocks are display in the view after pressing the Apply button. But the user would only expect to see one block each time. If i combine reader and filter together, i would have to open the data several times to see all different blocks(they need to compare with each other) which is not the way i want. Currently i have two options. Option one is that: reader stores all the data and subsequent filter retrieves block by block and construct the mesh accordingly. Option Two: The reader stores all data and constructed all the meshes but make them invisible to the user. Subsequent filter will retrieve block by block and display them.

        But neither way i do not know how to do it? Or it has the third or even more options?

Zhigao,

Are you creating your own reader?  If so, why not combine the actual reader and subsequent filter into a single "meta" reader class.  That way ParaView can read in the data and apply the block extraction all in one step.  It should make the user interface easier to use and gets around the problem in question.

     Thanks, Paul...The name part has been done according to your suggestion... The other question still remains:


      The scenario is that: I have a reader which reads a multiple block data. Each of the data block is a unstructured grid. After i load the data and press the Apply button. The meshes are displayed in the view window which is not what i want. I just want the reader to store the data and a subsequent filter will be used to retrieve the data block by block and display them. The grid needs to be constructed in the reader since all corresponding functions are in the reader. The filter knows nothing about these. Another option is "eyeball" icon in the pipeline browser, is it possible to "turn off" by default?

      What should I do? Setting the block name is for the filter to display the options that the user can choose. Is this the right way to do it?

      Thanks in advance.

Hi Zhigao,

If you are writing a reader or filter that returns a multi-block data set
you can name a block with the following:


MULTI_BLOCK_DATA_SET->GetMetaData(BLOCK_NUMBER)->Set(vtkCompositeDataSet::NAME(),
"PUT_NAME_HERE");

If you are just using ParaView you can use the "Extract Block" filter and
select the blocks you are interested in.   In the pipeline browser you can
change the name from "ExtractBlock1" to something more meaningful.

Regards,
Paul

Hi, all

     I just start to learn Paraview and use this tool to display some 3D images. The version I use is 3.2.1.

    Now I meet a problem: After loading a 3D labeled image, I try to use the threshold filter to display the labeled region with different color. If the "all scalar" option is selected, the regions can be displayed in different color, but seems to be a litter smaller. If the "All scalar" is not selected, the regions are just displayed in the same color. My question is: how to display the regions with different color in the non "all scalar" mode?

   So could anyone help me?

Thanks for the help, I've got that working perfectly. :D

One last question, I know by default in the legacy format the vector fields 
were of the format (i j k) (i j k) (i j k) etc... is it possible in the new 
xml format to output all the i components, then the j components, then the k 
components? This is how my data is structured in memory and would make it a 
lot easier.

Thanks

Subject: [Paraview] Programmatic interaction with the colorScalarBar
Message-ID: <49D38552.2040701@micron.com>


Hello List,

I have a custom object panel for a custom filter plugin, and wish to add 
some functionality to it.

In particular, I wish to programmatically

1.  set the colorBy scalar in the variableToolbar
2.  set the min/max range for the colorScalarBar
3.  turn on the colorScalarBar legend visibility

At the time my accept method is run, (when the user clicks accept), the 
filter's output has not yet been filled (since the RequestData has not 
yet been issued), and the view has not yet been opened.  Hence I do not 
have a pipeLineRepresentation in hand.  With a very distasteful hack I 
have used the timer to trigger a slot method 1 second later, at which 
time the view is filled and the dataRepresentation is available.  I 
imagine there must be some Qt or pq trigger fired when a new view has 
been created or when a new pipeLineRepresentation has been added to the 
pipeLine, but I have not yet been able to find it.

If I physically interact with the gui by clicking the 'Toggle Color 
Legend Visibility' QtToolButton in the variableToolbar, the color legend 
is displayed and a pqScalarBarRepresentation object is created and 
available through the core::ServerManager.  But I cannot figure out how 
to programmatically 'click' this QtToolButton.  Once the 
pqScalarBarRepresentation is created, performing 1 and 2 above is not 
too difficult.  Anybody have any hints for me?

Thanks, Chris

Message-ID: <c19fcadc0904011138i5b31d0cdod24e24972026d8b5@mail.gmail.com>

I would like to get something like stratified sampling:
http://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/~diego/academic/phd/597d/sample/<http://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/%7Ediego/academic/phd/597d/sample/>

I have a mesh which has some fine detail that requires a high vertex density
and some coarse detail that requires a low vertex density. What I would like
to is achieve a uniform vertex density. If I do a subdivision, it will make
the fine detail even finer, which is completely un-necessary. What I want is
either to resample the coarse detail at the same resolution as the fine
detail and leave the fine detail alone. Or, I could specify a vertex spacing
and make the fine detail less fine and the coarse detail more fine. Does
that make sense? Does Paraview or VTK have any tools to do something like
this?

Thanks,

David

Message-ID: <cfdf829e0904011317k2e594b2fvb78beb807ceafa4c@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,

I am a new user of ParaView and have a very basic question on how to
visualize the output of the 3D Delaunay triangulation. I am trying to plot a
surface traced by a guiding center particle in a planetary magnetic field. I
import particle positions (which belong to the surface) as an unstructured
grid. Then use the Delauday 3D filter with a non-zero Aplpha parameter (to
avoid triangulating distant points which do not belong to the surface) and
display the output using solid color Surface representation. As a result I
am getting almost what I need. The feature that I am trtying to get rid of
is the following: besides shading the triangles with solid color, ParaView
also plots all lines/edges from triangulations which clutter the plot. Is
there a way to supress the lines or should I be using a different approach
for plotting this surface?

Thank you very much in advance,
-Sasha

Has anyone been able to load plot3D files produced by FDS into Paraview
under Mac OSX 10.5.6?

 

I added the 'WRITE_XYZ=.TRUE.' statement to the &DUMP line in the FDS
module, which generates a binary *.xyz file. However, when attempting to
load that file into Paraview it fails to recognize any of the results
data.

 

Before posting files and error messages, I am just wondering whether
anyone is using Paraview to visualize FDS results and how!?

 

Many thanks,

Hi Hom Nath,

Thank you very much for your email. The code you send it starting to make sense for me, I would just appreciate if you would explain a few things for me. At the minute I am outputting as follows within <AppendedData>:

size = idim*jdim*sizeof(float);
totalsize = size*4;
file << "_";
file.write(reinterpret_case<const char*>(&totalsize), 4);
file.write(&Array1, size);
file.write(&Array2, size);
file.write(&Array3, size);
file.write(&Array4, size);

But sadly it's not working. I compute the offset as:

for (i = 0; i < 4; i++)
{
    offset[i] = i*size;
}

Things get extremely strange in Paraview. I have one outputting five arrays same as above and I can read and view for first, third and fifth no problems but not the second or the fourth. The three that read even look like they should (although without extremely detailed checking.

I assume I am missing something about how to either compute the offset or the binary layout. Your code seems to say that each dataarray should have its own integer binary output tells the size of that data instead of just one at the start of the array?

Any help is greatly appreciated.
David

I thought my C code may be helpful to you. I have 5 data array of different size, and I do like this:

nvar=5;
/* Bytes and offsets for ParaView file */    
    bytes[0] = (ndim*nnod)*sizeof(float);     /* Coordinates */
    bytes[1] = (nenod*nelmt)*sizeof(int);     /* Connectivity */
    bytes[2] = (nelmt)*sizeof(int);         /* Offsets */
    bytes[3] = (nelmt)*sizeof(int);         /* Types */
    bytes[4] = (nelmt)*sizeof(float);         /* Cell data */
    
    off[0]=0; /* 1st offset */
    for (i=0; i<nvar; i++){        
        if(i<nvar-1)off[i+1]=off[i]+sizeof(int)+bytes[i];
        bytes[i]=bytes[i]+sizeof(int); /* For each byte we must also add the sizeof(int) for itself also */   
    }

  Hi Thorsten, 

  I just tried that and it is now giving me a segmentation fault... I am using the following line: 
  file.write(reinterpret_cast<const char*>(size), 4);

  My size is calculated as - int size = idim*jdim*sizeof(float). idim is currently in the region of 400 and jdim 200. I am outputting big files and it is likely to get bigger.

  Also, I intend to include more data arrays each timestep, I just want to get it working with pressure first and then I will include then which is why I want to calculate the offset... I assuming it is just the number of bytes to the start of the next datafield...

  Thanks David

  Hello David,

  the offset parameter is relevant if you append mulitple data sections into a single file.
  Every DataArray tag with append format specifies the offset as the position in the 
  binary data in bytes.
  To write the integer I use the following:

  std::ofstream os; // binary mode (for windows ...) ofstream to your file
  int N; // size in bytes
  os.write(reinterpret_cast<const char*>(N), 4);

    That's really helpful. I don't quite know how to write out the number of bits as a char? If you could explain a way of how to do that it would be greatly appreciated. 

    Also, how do I calculate what value goes in for the offset? I had a look at a couple of output files from paraview and it wasnt obvious how it was calculated.

    Hello,

    the solution might be to append your data as

    < DataArray ... format="appended">
    </DataArray>
    < AppendedData encoding="raw">
    _NNNNData 
    </AppendedData>
    where you should replace NNNN with a four 
    byte integer containing the number of bytes 
    in the data array as 4 chars.
    Setting the encoding to "raw" tells ParaView, that
    the data is simply a stream of bytes rather than 
    base64 encoded.
    If you want to write Image I can supply a small
    writer project for 2D data.

      Hello,

      I am currently trying to write my own quick output routine to generate a

      I so far have the ASCII output working no problem but I can't get the binary 
      working.

      I am using file.write() function to output the binary data and that seems to 
      be working no problem and when used in a legacy format application it works 
      perfectly except that the data is LittleEndian instead of BigEndian. That's 
      why I have moved to BigEndian because I don't want to have to make the 
      output routine for the data anymore complicated that file.write.

      I started using the xml format and considering my output is raw binary and 
      not base64 I changed it to be in the AppendedData section instead of 
      DataArray. It still isn't working right, I get the following error when I 
      try to load in ParaView:

Thank you all for your help! Much appreciated and I now have some very fast binary output working compared to my previous ASCII output.

Hi, Moreland

        Thanks for your reply. Maybe i have confused you people. 

       Now the question is: how do I make a grid invisible to the user using code style not the "eyeball" in the pipeline browser? Or how can i hide the gird using code style?

        Thanks very much.

I don't know what the problem is with the reader reading one block at a time so long as only the data for a given block is read in at one time.  This is not all that different than iteratively reading the data for each time step during an animation, and that is what every reader in ParaView that supports time does.

Still, if you don't like that and you already have a reader and extract filter that are working to your satisfaction, my approach would probably be to write a third component that internally uses the reader and filter to perform the operation in one step.  In its constructor it would create the reader and filter and hook them up.  It would forward all its ivars (like filename and selected block) to the internal reader and filter.  In the RequestData call it would call Update on the internal filter and then shallow copy the internal filter's output to its own output.  If you are careful, the pipeline update mechanism will prevent the internal reader from re-executing unnecessarily.

Hi, Ken
        Thanks for your reply.

        Yes, i am using my own reader. Currently all the blocks are constructed in the reader. And all the blocks are display in the view after pressing the Apply button. But the user would only expect to see one block each time. If i combine reader and filter together, i would have to open the data several times to see all different blocks(they need to compare with each other) which is not the way i want. Currently i have two options. Option one is that: reader stores all the data and subsequent filter retrieves block by block and construct the mesh accordingly. Option Two: The reader stores all data and constructed all the meshes but make them invisible to the user. Subsequent filter will retrieve block by block and display them.

        But neither way i do not know how to do it? Or it has the third or even more options?

Zhigao,

Are you creating your own reader?  If so, why not combine the actual reader and subsequent filter into a single "meta" reader class.  That way ParaView can read in the data and apply the block extraction all in one step.  It should make the user interface easier to use and gets around the problem in question.

     Thanks, Paul...The name part has been done according to your suggestion... The other question still remains:


      The scenario is that: I have a reader which reads a multiple block data. Each of the data block is a unstructured grid. After i load the data and press the Apply button. The meshes are displayed in the view window which is not what i want. I just want the reader to store the data and a subsequent filter will be used to retrieve the data block by block and display them. The grid needs to be constructed in the reader since all corresponding functions are in the reader. The filter knows nothing about these. Another option is "eyeball" icon in the pipeline browser, is it possible to "turn off" by default?

      What should I do? Setting the block name is for the filter to display the options that the user can choose. Is this the right way to do it?

      Thanks in advance.

Hi Zhigao,

If you are writing a reader or filter that returns a multi-block data set
you can name a block with the following:


MULTI_BLOCK_DATA_SET->GetMetaData(BLOCK_NUMBER)->Set(vtkCompositeDataSet::NAME(),
"PUT_NAME_HERE");

If you are just using ParaView you can use the "Extract Block" filter and
select the blocks you are interested in.   In the pipeline browser you can
change the name from "ExtractBlock1" to something more meaningful.

Paul

Subject: [Paraview] Should I put the files I include in my reader in the

Message-ID: <245222690904012312j35325197wa1cb11a7063e55ea@mail.gmail.com>

Hello, everyone!
I am trying to build a reader Plugin into ParaView
 In my reader code, I include my own c++ file to get the actual data and put
the data into a data object in reader code! So, should I put my own c++ code
with reader code into the same folder, and then run the CMake to produce the
source?

Thank you so much!

Message-ID: <972af284a7bc930af2879ccee9d8a1e7@93.63.207.2>




Hi all,

for a structured, multiblock CFD data which is the best Paraview-readable
file format? I need an equivalent multi-zone Tecplot file. At today I save
each block of the CFD data set in separate .vts file:

block-01.vts
block-02.vts
block-03.vts
block-04.vts
block-05.vts
...
with a large number of blocks this way is very boring: Paraview reads the
sequence of vts as a temporal sequence, thus I must to load each block
manually (I think that I can edit a Paraview-state file, but it is also
boring).
I need a single multi-block(zone) file. Any suggestions?

My best regards,
Stefano

the solution is to write a wrapper which is a collection of grids. Each
item in the collection can itself be a collection of sub-grids. So it is
fully hierarchical.

here is an example, which ParaView will read in a single button click:

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<VTKFile type="vtkMultiBlockDataSet" version="1.0"
byte_order="LittleEndian" compressor="vtkZLibDataCompressor">
  <vtkMultiBlockDataSet>
    <Block index="0">
      <DataSet index="0" file="foo/foo_0.vts"></DataSet>
      <DataSet index="1" file="foo/foo_1.vts"></DataSet>
    </Block>
    <Block index="1">
      <Block index="0">
        <DataSet index="0" file="foo/foo_896.vts"></DataSet>
        <DataSet index="1" file="foo/foo_897.vts"></DataSet>
        <DataSet index="2" file="foo/foo_898.vts"></DataSet>
      </Block>
      <Block index="1">
        <DataSet index="0" file="foo/foo_1397.vts"></DataSet>
        <DataSet index="1" file="foo/foo_1398.vts"></DataSet>
        <DataSet index="2" file="foo/foo_1399.vts"></DataSet>
      </Block>
    </Block>
  </vtkMultiBlockDataSet>
</VTKFile>

Message-ID: <e7f43c4f0904020204h39794f57r81f23c680937db6@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I am unsuccessfully fighting with XML description of the VTK
vtkImageMathematics filter. I want it to be available in the ParaView
filters. At the end of this mail is the XML I wrote, widely inspired from
"Append Geometry".

Note that it is part of a larger file making available ImageGaussianSmooth,
ImageSobel3D, ImageFilp, SplineFilter, some different sources... Everything
works well, except Image Mathematics and Image Reslice (I told about Reslice
in another thread).

The symptom is the following : the "Image Math" appears in the filters list,
but is always unavailable, even if I select one proxy or two in the
pipeline. What is the diagnostic, doctors ? Is there a therapy ?

Thanks all !

Best regards,
Jerome

Message-ID: <21265810.474571238668290686.JavaMail.coremail@bj163app128.163.com>

Hi everyone:
  I have written a Reader for my ducuments. This plugin can be build and used successfully within paraview,but I can't show it in "File of type".
It's like that when I want to open my document which is type of *.sgn.There is not a option of *.sgn in "File of type".I must choose the "All files" to show my documents(*.sgn) and then open them. Can anyone tell me how can I add my ducument type of the Reader in "Flie of type"? So that I can choose the option *.sgn in "File of type" to show my documents(*.sgn) when I want to open them.
  Thanks very much !
Jackie Chen

Hi Jean,

thank you very much for your tip! It works perfectly. 
Just another question: how can I &quot;handle&quot; the single block? It
seems that I
can &quot;play&quot; (applay filters, display ecc...) with only all blocks
together
while in the &quot;information&quot; tab I can see the hierarchical data
with each
block separately. It would be wonderfull if it is possible to maintain the
hierarchical data set and, at the same time, to manage each single block.

Thank you very much.

Stefano

Have you added the GUI xml which assigns the extension with your
reader? Refer to:

I justed loaded your XML as a plugin in CVS ParaView is seems to being
enabled fine. I was able to apply the filter to Mandlebrot source.
What version of ParaView are you using?

Since your plugin is built in your own directory separate from ParaView, you should do what ever makes sense for you.

Subject: [Paraview] The difference between Extending ParaView at compile
	time and at run time?
Message-ID: <245222690904020730n4b7fff8vb62b9bf8ed5bf782@mail.gmail.com>

Hello, everyone!
I am trying to know the difference between Extending ParaView at compile
time and at run time.
In my thought, extend paraview at compile time means that before I compile
ParaView with CMake and VS2005, I made some changes to tell the compiler to
include the plugins I made. So, after that, when I compile the ParaView, it
will compile the plugin as a default part?
And extend paraview at run time means after I compiled the paraView , I
budid the plugin and use Tool Menu to add to the paraview!
Am I right about the difference ?Please tell me something about that!
Thank you so much!

You are correct.

  I _think_ the current way to extend paraview with your own plugin is  
as follows:

Go to <http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ 
Extending_ParaView_at_Compile_Time> for an example of how to do this.

That article has all the information that you will need.

Hi,

Many thanks for your quick answer. The problem I described was observed on
Paraview 3.4 release, debug build. I have a 3.5 CVS (not updated, so bad...)
on which I tried my XML just right now: "Image Math" is no more gray!! I am
able to apply the filter on a single image, with "Add constant", "Multiply
by constant", etc.

The new problem is when I want to add two image. I selected two mandelbrot
sources, then I plugged the "Image Math" filter. The output window claims:
"Input port 0 of algorithm vtkImageMathematics(0x7f081c4bcb70) has 2
connections but is not repeatable".

I tried the repeat_command="1" statement, without optimism and not much
success... It seems that vtkImageMathematics input is old-fashionned, but
the VTK doc says that SetInput1 and SetInput2 is like involking
AddInputConnection. Where do I miss something ???

Thanks for all,

Jerome

I turned off the overlapping domain decomposition (ghost cells) for a  
simple problem and the sequence

MergeBlocks->CleantoGrid->ExtractSurface->Clip

shows just the physical boundary of the problem (clipped open so you  
can see inside). Also volume visualization and streamline calculation  
works with no processor boundary artifacts.

 From what I understand, there are no filters in paraview or  
abstractions in the XDMF data model  at this time that will allow  
paraview to read in overlapping blocks and really make use of the  
ghost cells correctly. For now truncating our output to only "owned"  
elements will solve our problems. Thanks again for the help.

Ok !
No, it doesn't work, but I made my mind:

* vtkImageMathematics has two input ports, the second one being optional.
That's why the XML works with one filter.

* Function SetInput1 and SetInput2 are wrappers around SetInputConnection
for old-style programming compatibility. SetInputX is in fact
SetInputConnection(X-1, input_port1 )

When using AddInputConnection like vtkImageAppend does, it is based on the
'one port' fashion of the filter, then multiple inputs means multiple
connections on one port... That is not the case for vtkImageMathematics !!

So, I would like to use kind of number_of_elements statement and
element_types statement to handle something like :
<InputProperty
                       name="Input1"
                       command="SetInputConnection"
                       number_of_elements="2"
                       element_types="0 3"   <!-- Yes I know, type '3' does
not exist: I want this to be vtkAlgorithmOutput -->
                       default_values="0 Input1"> <!-- Yes I know, but you
see what I means ?? -->
            <ProxyGroupDomain name="groups">
                  <Group name="sources"/>
                  <Group name="filters"/>
            </ProxyGroupDomain>
            <DataTypeDomain name="input_type">
                 <DataType value="vtkImageData"/>
            </DataTypeDomain>
            <Documentation>
                  Set the input to the vtkImageMathematics filter.
            </Documentation>
  </InputProperty>


And then the same with Input2, where default_values would be "1 Input2".
I know one solution is to create an inherited class from
vtkImageMathematics, with accessors on input port 0 and port 1. I already
did that for vtkImageStencil, what works fine. My problem here is to make
vtkImageMathematic available without building any plugins: c++-allergics
have rights to use image addition and substraction inside ParaView !! one
XML to load, that's all !

I hope -for these allergics- that there is a solution...

You are on the right track. The difference between vtkImageAppend and
vtkImageMathematics is that the former supports "multiple input
connections on a single input port" while the latter supports "one
input connection each on two input ports". This former is supported in
the XML by using the multiple_input attribute, while for the latter,
you need to have two separate input properties as follows:

<InputProperty name="Input1" command="SetInputConnection" ... />  <!--
port_index="0" is by default -->
<InputProperty name="Input2" port_index="1" command="SetInputConnection" ... />

The key here is the "port_index" attribute.

Subject: [Paraview] XDMF HyperSlab hints or example needed
Message-ID: <bENA0kFp3h1JFwFm@visual-technologies.co.uk>

Does anyone have some small working examples of XDMF xml
using they hyperslab option? I've yet to create any that will
load with any stability in either the release or current dev versions.
Suggestions for correcting the XDMF sample, or other working samples
are very much appreciated!

With both ParaView 3.4 Release and 3.5.0 Development, current CVS,
loading this XML file brings down ParaView at the "Apply" stage.
Very occasionally it loads but shows garbage data ranges.

Here is a simple test of a 2D uniform grid, subsampled by 2 in X.
Save it to "test.xmf", then File-Load into ParaView.

Subject: [Paraview] visualization a lot of models
Message-ID: <49D622B2.3010906@cs.wm.edu>

Hi,
If I have a lot of models and each one is represented by a mesh. If I
want to see all these models, one method is to load all these models
into memory. However the memory is an issue. The another method is to
only load the models, which can be seen from the current point of view
into the memory. When I rotate, some models will be brought into the
view and they will be loaded automatically. Does paraview support this?

Best,

Yixun

I agree that there's something very screwy going on. I can sometimes  
load a slightly reformatted version of this, but only when I've just  
opened PV 3.4, and even then when I look in a spreadsheet view it's  
not showing the correct data (not jumping by 2 in last dim). If I  
"delete" and reload, it crashes. I tried another test set that's 3d to  
begin with, and got a lot of crashes, too.

Sorry I have to run, but wanted you to know that I'm seeing something  
very similar.

Utkarsh, this is exactly what I want. Thanks a lot !
For those interested in, I give in the following the XML for exposing
vtkImageMathematics filter into ParaView filters menu. They are some weird
behaviour, but I am going further on (like : no "Change input" choice when
right clicking on the Image Math in the pipeline...)

Thanks again !

Jerome

I constantly have the same problem than you removing the parallel
interfaces. Even worse, since my solver does not use ghost cells at all.

BTW, try to execute the following pipelining in ParaView *version 2.2.1*.

Extract Surface --> Clean to grid --> Clip

Not sure if  it also works with Xdmf format. In my case, I used to employ
Ensight format and althought writing the SOS file, this method only works
for me when I load the parallel files serially one-by-one, so, in this case,
you'd need to put a "Append Data Sets" before "Extract Surface".

It's sad but I keep using this old version when I need to get rid of my
parallel interfaces.

Renato.

p.s.: It seems that if you'd like to use ParaView in parallel without

The right way to deal with this situation is to mark the ghost cells
as ghost. If you create a cell array called vtkGhostLevels and assign
0 to inside cells and 1 to ghost cells, you should not need
MergeBlocks or CleanToGrid. Note that this array has to be of type
unsigned char. There are actual benefits to keeping ghost levels since
some algorithms will produce better results.

MergeBlocks->CleantoGrid->ExtractSurface->Clip
should work for you in 3.4. If not, there is something else wrong. I
would like to see a dataset. I think we can make the whole thing work
without MergeBlocks and CleanToGrid if we required that you define a
vtkGhostLevels array that is point centered. The internal points that
are shared would be marked as level 1. ParaView would throw away any
polygon that has only points of level 1. What do you think?

I like the suggestion of giving better names to the inputs. I have
always disliked how confusing Input and Source are. If I remember
correctly, it is backwards because I changed it to be more compatible
with some other filter, maybe stream tracer? What about Source and
Target? Does that make it clear that we are probing the data from the
source to the geometry on the target?

I don't think ParaView is the right fit for your application. You
should probably look at renderers that support on demand loading,
specially if you are interested only rendering the models and not
filtering them. Maybe something along the lines of Coin3D or
OpenInventor?

I am not familiar with FDS. Does it produce standard single-block or
multi-block structured PLOT3D files? If yes, can you post a small
example?

Hi Peter,

Can you give us the first 10-20 timesteps of this dataset? Maybe there
is a memory leak somewhere and I would like to debug it.

This doesn't sound right. Can you post a screenshot (of the whole user

I am not very familiar with VTK's computational geometry algorithms
but to my knowledge we don't have a filter that can do this. I am
cross-posting to VTK's list in case someone there has a suggestion.
That algorithm is pretty cool by the way. Maybe you can contact the
original other and see if he is interested in releasing his source
code?

Berk,

Thanks for correcting me. I'll try adding the vtkGhostLevels to the  
XDMF and see how that goes.

Thanks again, this did the trick.
I have  one further question on the subject:
If I have read the hte min/max data into GUI
correctly, how do I set the slider in the GUI
to an arbitrary value within the range or
 the minimal/maximal value?

As an alternative, Are there any other imaging formats written by ITK
for which paraview has a time dependent reader?
I have a time series of imaging data that I want to animate.
I have used paraview's python command line interface to animate
the files in the past, but am wondering if there was an easier way?


thank you,
David Fuentes

Message-ID: <97433b88a9a8e3dfb6aa0b5201eda8fe@actiflow.com>

Dear All,

I am looking for an example script/pointers on how to write
IntegrateAttributes 
(Integrate01 =
servermanager.filters.IntegrateAttributes(registrationGroup='sources',registrationName='Integrator',Input=Calculator01))
to a CSV file, when using Python.

I cannot find the right functions to do so.

Thanks in advance,

Bart

Dear Xdmf users and developers,

I'd like to know if it is possible to run animations in Paraview, with
XDMF2 format? I asked the same question few days ago, without any
response. I was not sure if the email got through. Can someone respond
even if he/she is doesn't know the answer, so that I know that I am
sending the messages to right place.

The short answer is yes. ParaView supports loading of temporal xdmf2
based datasets and the allows the user to play through the timesteps.

Geometry sounds good.  Data is a bit vague.  How about probe points?  Or probe locations?  Or just locations?

I was able to replicate this with the point source (10 points, radius 1), and the Delaunay 3D filter with alpha set to .8.  See the attached image, Berk.

Bart,

Here's how you'd do it with the CVS version of ParaView (you'll need
to make sure your ParaView is up-to-date since I just committed some
fixes exposing a filter used by this script).

from paraview import servermanager as sm
sm.Connect()
sphere = sm.sources.SphereSource()
ia = sm.filters.IntegrateAttributes(Input=sphere)

# AttributeDataToTableFilter converts any dataset to a vtkTable which can be
# written as a CSV file. One needs to choose which attribute to save as well.
# First save points.
convertor = sm.filters.AttributeDataToTableFilter(Input=ia,
  FieldAssociation="Points",
  AddMetaData=1)
csvWriter = sm.writers.CSVWriter(Input=convertor)
csvWriter.FileName = "/tmp/output.points.csv"

# this writes the output.
csvWriter.UpdatePipeline()

# Now save cells.
convertor.FieldAssociation="Cells"
csvWriter = sm.writers.CSVWriter(Input=convertor)
csvWriter.FileName = "/tmp/output.cells.csv"

# this writes the output.
csvWriter.UpdatePipeline()

Well the idea is that the Geometry is composed of the probe points and
locations.... Whilst the Data is the original data that will be interpolated
onto the Geometry....
Geometry and probe points I think would be even more confusing

Subject: [Paraview] just an observation--resample with dataset filter

Keep in mind that the filter is called "Resample with dataset" not
Probe. I don't think Probe will be clear to users that are not
familiar with VTK.

Hmmm, I assumed that this was a bug but it is not. It is a feature of
the filter (see the documentation for alpha). The only way I can see
of turning it off is to change the source code of the filter. I also
can't think of a filter that would remove everything but tets... It
would be fairly easy to write one using programmable filter though.

Berk, forgive for delaying my response (I was out of my lab...)

Just a silly question:

What do you exactly mean by "Ghost cell"? This silly question is justified
by the fact that I thought that ghost cells only make sense when we have
subdomains _overlapped_. In these cases, the number of overlapped cell
layers should (or could) be considered as "ghost level".

In my case, the subdomains are not overlapped at all. They are just
partitioned by Metis and the solver can deal with the computations without
the need to use overlapped elements. Thus, if "ghost cells" can be simply
defined by "cells somehow touching the parallel interface (even those not
overlapped)" I think I could try tagging my parallel interface cells as
"ghost level 0" to see what happens...

Renato.

I did not mean ghost cells. I meant ghost points. If you were to mark
the points at a shared interface as ghost (more appropriately
duplicated), we can easily throw away all polygons that contain all
duplicate points when extracting external surfaces. Even better, if we
had an array that had values like:

-1        : point not shared
n >= 0 : point shared, owned by process n

we could make bunch of filters work correctly - mainly statistics ones
and the glyph filter. Is this something that is easy for your
simulation to write?

Yes, it's quite easy to implement (I just need to figure out how I do that
in Xdmf format... but it must be easy...)

Just to emphasize the subject -- or piss you off ;oP

The term "ghost" (some people use "halo". In portuguese it's "fantasma") is
suitable to define something that does not really exist -- or exists somehow
in another life ;o) -- in this sense, only cells (or nodes) that are not
really owned by a subdomain should be considered as ghosts. Consequently,
only cells (or nodes) that come from other parallel subdomains (in other
words, are somehow overlapped) should be considered as "ghost cells" or
"ghost nodes".

As I said, just trying to piss you off...

of course, I'm kidding....

Renato.

It explains why I never tried to define an array of ghost cells in my code.
They simply does not exist in my case...

I would vote for the ghost points. This is really a cool feature for
datasets that doesn't have overlapping cells.

Renato.

Spatial discrete algorithms based on the finite element method rarely if 
ever require "ghost cells" extending beyond the physical boundary.

Algorithms based on finite difference technology almost always require a 
layer of ghost cells around the analysis domain to allow the 
point-centered algorithms to be computed. Data on the ghost cells and 
ghost points is generally assigned to allow the finite difference 
algorithm to execute.

For parallel domains, along the shared boundaries, the ghost cells must 
acquire their data through swaps with adjacent domains.

The corresponding ghost cells on each subdomain usually are included in 
the output results data for the subdomain, and the post-processors are 
obliged to have algorithms and conventions to deal with the ghost cells 
and their data.

In my humble opinion, the ghost cells and ghost points are not needed 
for post-processing, but they are so "natural" to the finite difference 
algorithm world that nobody would think to live without them.

However, ghost cells and ghost points and their data are needed to 
restart a simulation and many developers want their restart files and 
post-processing files to be one in the same file.

For what its worth,

Sam Key

Subject: [Paraview] Question about wrapping my own class within a reader
Message-ID: <245222690904061842h7a2ee211naccb7670b9489bba@mail.gmail.com>

Hello, everyone !
I am writing a reader for my cuntom data format!
Now I have some troubles for help.
1.My reader is named vtkSgnReader, and I use class vtkSgn to get the data
information and the actual data.And then send the data into the reader. So
In my vtkSgnreader.h, i quote this:
#include "vtkSgn", and in my Reader code, I wrote like this:

int vtkSgnReader::ReadMetaData(vtkInformation *outInfo)
{
    int dimsRead=0;
    if (!sgnfile.Readsgn(FileName))
    {
        return 1;
    }
int dim[3];
    dim[0] = sgnfile.GetNx();
    dim[1] = sgnfile.GetNy();
    dim[2] = sgnfile.GetNz();
    //set the output information
    outInfo->Set(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::WHOLE_EXTENT(),
                 0, dim[0]-1, 0, dim[1]-1, 0, dim[2]-1);
    return 1;
}
And the function Readsgn(FileName) is defined in class vtkSgn. I am
wondering if this is correct!

2.After I wrote the source code and the XML file, I am trying to build it
with CMake and VS2005. When I use VS2005 build the plugin, the compile gives
me some errors like this:

2>Generating vtkSgnClientServer.cxx
1>Generating qrc_SgnReader.cxx
2>*** SYNTAX ERROR found in parsing the header file E:/test/vtkSgn.h before
line 40 ***
2>syntax error

I just do not know whatis wrong with this! So could anyone can help me?
Thank you so much for your help!

Yep. Here is the fun part.

Paste _exactly_ your "line 40 of vtkSgn.h" and lets see what we can  
come up with.

Subject: [Paraview] How to add file extensions into the Open File Dialog
Message-ID: <245222690904062254g5b742b89t41bf085cf0ee3a5f@mail.gmail.com>

Hello, everyone!
I have written a reader plugin for my oew data format, and I just built
it.Now I want to add the extension in the Files of type in the Open File
dialog.
I have written my GUI xml and SERVER xml and my CMakeLIsts.txt file like
below:

FIND_PACKAGE(ParaView REQUIRED)
INCLUDE(${PARAVIEW_USE_FILE})

#define the server-side portion of the reader plugin
ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN(SgnReaderPlugin "1.0"
  SERVER_MANAGER_XML SgnReaderSM.xml
  SERVER_MANAGER_SOURCES vtkSgnReader.cxx
  GUI_RESOURCE_FILES SgnReaderGUI.xml)

My GUI.xml like this:

<ParaViewReaders>
  <Reader name="SgnReader"
    extensions="sgn"
    file_description="My Sgn Files">
  </Reader>
</ParaViewReaders>

and My SERVER xml like this:

  <ProxyGroup name="sources">
    <SourceProxy name="SgnReader"
                 class="vtkSgnReader">
      <StringVectorProperty
        name="FileName"
        command="SetFileName"
        number_of_elements="1">
        <FileListDomain name="files"/>
      </StringVectorProperty>
    </SourceProxy>
  </ProxyGroup>

But, after I load the plugin. It does NOT show the extension in the files of
type. I just want to know what's wrong with my files?
Thank you so much!

Subject: [Paraview] How to show my Reader in "File of type" when I open my
 documents?(Again)
Message-ID: <30716151.251041239086867422.JavaMail.coremail@bj163app137.163.com>

Hi everyone:
  I have written a Reader for my ducuments. This plugin can be build and used successfully within paraview,but I can't show it in "File of type".
It's like that when I want to open my document which is type of *.sgn.There is not a option of *.sgn in "File of type".I must choose the "All files" to show my documents(*.sgn) and then open them. Can anyone tell me how can I add my ducument type of the Reader in "Flie of type"? So that I can choose the option *.sgn in "File of type" to show my documents(*.sgn) when I want to open them.
  My GUI.xml for the plugin above follows:
  <ParaViewReaders>
  <Reader name="SgnReader"
    extensions="sgn"
    file_description="My Sgn Files">
  </Reader>
</ParaViewReaders>
  
  Thanks very much !
Jackie Chen

Subject: [Paraview] 32b vs 64b and Binary vs Ascii
Message-ID: <49DB1961.90804@scconsultants.com>

we face non recurrent problem trying to read .vtu files containing 
Velocity vectors.
Paraview 3.4.0 replies with "...dataArray may be too short"  in some  
conditions.

the vtu are written under Linux 64 :
if reading whose vtu with client "windows 32" and server "linux 64" we 
quite often have the message "...dataArray may be too short" from 
Paraview 3.4.0. The same vtu file read locally under windows 32 is Ok.
Time to Time it is vice versa : the problem occurs under windows 32 and 
run correctly under client/server.
If we mask the velocity field at loading it is working.

-Ascii mode sounds more secure even though it is not working 100% of the 
cases.
-Finally, different vtu from a same run (at different time step) behave 
differentely.

thanks to anybody having encountered those type of problem or who may 
have some suggestions.

What code are you using to write the .vtu files? Is it vtk code or is  
it code that you wrote for your own simulation? It sounds like it  
_might_ be incorrect values in the header parts of the velocity field.  
I believe .vtu files are ascii so you should be able to hand check the  
values that are being saved into the file with what you think you  
should be writing.

    Also on the off chance that your simulation is using either  
threads or MPI or something where it is distributed are you locking  
the section of code where the writing is performed? Possibly sounds  
like 2 processes maybe accessing and writing to the areas of memory as  
the same ares is being written to disk.

  Just some thoughts.

Message-ID: <245222690904070612j4f9648dehd086a3a1b3abd318@mail.gmail.com>

Hello!
I have read in the mailing lists that you have done with a reader plugin
very well. So, I am wondering whether you can help me to point out what's
wrong with my code!
Thank you!
I have written a reader plugin, and I have installed into the paraview
source code. So, now I can find my custom extension file type in the Open
File dialog!
But Now, the plugin seems does NOT work properly. When I try to open a sgn
file which I defined, the ParaView just crash. So, could you please check my
code and find where I was wrong!
Thank you so much!!!

Here is my code:
vtkSgnReader.h

Did you write a GUI xml file to describe your reader to ParaView and 
tell ParaView what file extension you are using?

Subject: [Paraview] Question about runing my own reader!
Message-ID: <245222690904070636s32104836ve5a1dbe7f723b3a@mail.gmail.com>

Hello, everyone!
I wrote my own reader plugin for my custom data format.
But when I use it, it seems do NOT work!
It seems can NOT execute  the function RequetInformation.
Should I use the method ProcessRequest()?
May some one can help me out?
Thanks so much!

Here are my some parts of codes:

int vtkSgnReader::RequestInformation(vtkInformation *vtkNotUsed(request),
                                     vtkInformationVector
**vtkNotUsed(inputVector),
                                     vtkInformationVector *outputVector)
{
         vtkInformation *outInfo = outputVector->GetInformationObject(0);
          return this->ReadMetaData(outInfo);
}

int vtkSgnReader::ReadMetaData(vtkInformation *outInfo)
{
    if (!sgnfile->Readsgn(FileName))
    {
        return 1;
    }
    int dim[3];
    dim[0]=sgnfile->GetNx();
    dim[1]=sgnfile->GetNy();
    dim[2]=sgnfile->GetNz();
    //Set the extent
    outInfo->Set(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::WHOLE_EXTENT(),
                     0, dim[0]-1, 0, dim[1]-1, 0, dim[2]-1);
    return 1;
}

int vtkSgnReader::RequestData(vtkInformation *vtkNotUsed(request),
                              vtkInformationVector
**vtkNotUsed(inputVector),
                              vtkInformationVector *outputVector)
{
    vtkInformation *outInfo = outputVector->GetInformationObject(0);
    vtkImageData *output = vtkImageData::GetData(outInfo);
   int *extent = output->GetUpdateExtent();
    int numPts=0;
    int L, M, N;
    if (!sgnfile->Readsgn(FileName))
    {
        return 1;
    }
    int dim[3];
    dim[0] = sgnfile->GetNx();
    L = dim[0];
    dim[1] = sgnfile->GetNy();
    M = dim[1];
    dim[2] = sgnfile->GetNz();
    N = dim[2];
    numPts = dim[0]*dim[1]*dim[2];
   output->SetExtent(extent);
    output->SetOrigin(origin);
    output->SetSpacing(ar);

    //set the scalar data
    vtkShortArray *castkey = vtkShortArray::New();
    castkey->SetName("casting_type");
    castkey->SetNumberOfComponents(1);
    castkey->SetNumberOfTuples(numPts);
    for (int i=0; i<L; i++)   for (int j=0;j<M; j++)   for (int k=0; k<N;
k++)
    {
        int idx = i*M*N+j*N+k;
        castkey->SetTupleValue( idx, &(sgnfile->GetSGNData()[idx]) );
    }
    output->GetPointData()->AddArray(castkey);
    castkey->Delete();
    return 1;
}

Do I have something wrong with my code?
Thank you so much for your truly help!

thanks for your feedback:
We do use in-house FEM code which also use MPI: I will cross check your 
suggestions. Small vtu work fine but 300mb one have problems (where it 
is not obvious to manually check them). thank you again

philippe,

you might be running into the same problem i had in that the vtu (or all XML
styled files) have a
problem in that all the contents (points, connectivity, data) must be shorter
than 2^31.
it's the way the thing is written... there's an "int" (or several) that needs
to be
a long int or long long int.

sounds like your grid is large or has a lots of data variables, either way
the XML format isn't capable of handling it presently. 

it would be desirable for the XML writing codes to flag this and at least
give you a warning about this.

for what it's worth, i got around this by writing binary legacy vtk files.

Michael Jackson a ?crit : 

	What code are you using to write the .vtu files? Is it vtk code or is
it code that you wrote for your own simulation? It sounds like it _might_ be
incorrect values in the header parts of the velocity field. I believe .vtu
files are ascii so you should be able to hand check the values that are being
saved into the file with what you think you should be writing. 
	
	   Also on the off chance that your simulation is using either
threads or MPI or something where it is distributed are you locking the
section of code where the writing is performed? Possibly sounds like 2
processes maybe accessing and writing to the areas of memory as the same ares
is being written to disk. 
	
	 Just some thoughts.

In that case I guess I was simply confused by the names geometry and data.  How about the names "input field" and "sample points"?

Message-ID: <49DB61BD.20803@bluequartz.net>



Hello!
I have done the work to write a custom reader plugin and can show extension
in the Open File dialog.
But now, I have another question.
My reader seems do NOT work!
In my reader code, I used RequestInformation, RequestData, and ReadMetaData
which was executed in RequestInformation.
But it doesn't work!!
Should I use RequestDataObject to create a output data object? Or I can do
this in RequestInformation with :
vtkInformation *outInfo = outputVector->GetInformationObject(0);


Thank you so much!

I was hitting the same problem and I ended up writing the unstructured  
grid to and HDF5 file. I wrote the code so that the writing was  
portable and NOT vtk dependent but reading the HDF5 data would read it  
directly into a vtkUnstructuredGrid object. Never really cleaned up  
the code but anyone is welcome to it if you want. Just shoot me  an  
email off list.

Hi everyone,

We have python wrappers (C++) to run our simulation ( unstructured grid
based solver).
When a simulation is running, I would like to see update results on
Paraview.
Could you help me for initial guidiance?

I  just started using  Paraview, sorry if it is asked before,

oops.. Well my code wasn't quite what I remembered. I do have code to 
read/write vtkUnstructuredGrids from an HDF5 file BUT all the code _is_ 
based on vtk code. Sorry for the mis-information. What is there is the 
beginnings of a "translation" of vtk files into HDF5 files. I think the 
idea was to try and create a library where one could write "vtk" files 
into HDF5 files using the native hdf5 services. So instead of writing an 
xml file or ASCII file the data is stored natively into an HDF5 file. I 
think all the farther I got was for unstructured grids. I think if you 
followed the layout of the hdf5 file with your own code the at least the 
reader portion would be useful. Unless you want to bring in vtk into 
your simulation as a dependency.

  Again sorry for the mis-information on this. I am truly "red-faced" 
over this.

The lowest hanging fruit: If your simulation is writing out data files intermittently, you can just start ParaView and load them in.  This is a somewhat common mode of operation.

Further integration requires some coding, which in turn has some much steeper learning curves.  There are several ongoing projects that are integrating ParaView with running simulations (most operating in "batch" mode).  The end game we hope for is to make the process much simpler.

Hi,
My question is I want to render a lot of models, which are represented
by mesh. After these models appear on the screen I want to add an
additional model. I add the actor corresponding to the model to the
vtkRenderer and then call render() to show all these models. What I want
to know is only this model is redrew or all the models need to be
redrew.  Maybe this is a question related with VTK.

Thanks.

Berk,

It's working fine. If you create a plane, then the previously none-visible obstacles become apparent and the data is also visible. Thank you.

As a separate question (and this might have been answered in a previous posting), is there a way of loading all the *.q files or a way of loading one after another (automatically) in order to create an animation?

Many thanks,

Alexej

I am not familiar with FDS. Does it produce standard single-block or

Hi Battalgazi,

Since you already can drive your simulation with Python, another
relatively simple way (until ParaView directly supports it) could be
to add to your Python code to update the ParaView scene every time
after you write the simulation data.
http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Python_Scripting

I may be wrong in details since I have done this only in C++ not in
Python, but the steps should look something like
- mark anyhow your ParaView reader as modified
- reader.UpdatePipelineInformation() to rescan the timesteps
- reader.UpdatePropertyInformation() to pull the updated timesteps
- get the last element of reader.TimestepValues
- set the view.ViewTime to the last timestep
- (optional) rescale the range of the color lookup table
- view.StillRender()

Hi,

I have just begun with python scripting in Paraview. I agree that I should
use servermanager to communicate to Paraview Engine.

But problem is  (at least for me) how will I add my own source (or reader)
in servermanager.source.  is there any place or book I can look how I can
create  new reader ( servermanager.sources.MyReader())?

Hello, everyone!
I have a question about writing a reader of my own!
Do I need use the method ProcessRequest to set the output object or just set
the type of output object in the method RequestInformation?
And I do NOT know which method in reader is the first to be called when read
a file?Is the RequestInformation or something else!
Thank you so much for your help!

Subject: [Paraview] Questions regarding: volume calculation,
	xyplot along a curve and 	tensor calculation
Message-ID: <162b55750904072022r35d5dbadx6cde3c9d0593b1bf@mail.gmail.com>

Hi there,

I am using linux version of paraview to read .vtk data files. (Anyone
knows if I can attach documents in this mail list?) I have two
questions:

1) Volume calculation:
I found that the "integrate variables" over a sphere clip never gives
the correct volume. For example, I tried to use a very simple geometry
and a very fine mesh (a 200x200x200 micron cube with 2 micron cube
elements), and use paraview to generate a sphere clip that has radius
of 50 micron in the center of that cube, then I apply the "integrate
variables" filter to the clip and show the "Cell Data", it gives a
volume of 4.78818e-13 instead of 5.236e-13, which is 4/3*pi*r^3. The
discrepancy is so large that it just cannot be due to the coarseness
of the mesh. Different mesh and different size of clips gives
different discrepancies, and I cannot find any obvious relationship
between the paraview-calculated volume and the real volume.

2) X-Y plot: how can I do a xyplot of a scalar along a curved line?
For example, if I have the pressure field data from a
flow-around-a-cylinder case, I want to plot the pressure along the
surface of the cylinder as a function of angle or arc length.

3) tensor calculation: I have the pressure field and velocity field
calculated from a CFD tool (Transat in my case), how do I calculate
stress tensors at each point from P V field in paraview?

I am new to paraview and this mail list, please let me know if I asked
any inappropriate questions. Thanks in advance for your kind help.

Regards,
Jie

Consult the following link to learn how to make a plugin reader. Once
compiled -- assuming you already have PYTHON enabled in your paraview
build -- your own reader will automatically be active as
servermanager.sources.MyReader

http://paraview.org/Wiki/Plugin_HowTo

Running pvpython for example, you may type the command
servermanager.LoadPlugin("/path/to/your-plugin/libMyReader*.so") and
your plugin will be loaded.

Hi,

Well... since vertices are 0-dimension objects (lines are 1- , triangle are
2-,...) I would answered that point clouds are 0-dimensionned. But if your
points are connected by lines, it is 1-dimensionned, if lines represents
polygonal cells (like a triangulation), it is 2-dimensionned. You can check
this by the existence of different cells in a polydata: Verts, Lines,
Polys,...

'Hope this helps

Best regards,
Jerome

Hello, everyone!
I am doing some development on paraview.
I just want to know if I can design a custom Object Panel using Qt Designer
and make the panel work with my custom reader plugin. And the panel will
show some information that my data have such as the number of points, the
scalar name and so on like that. I just want to know does that can be done
or can custom object panel can realize that function?
Thank you so much!

You almost never have to override the ProcessRequest method.  The default ProcessRequest for all the algorithm convenience classes (like vtkImageAlgorithm, vtkPolyDataAlgorithm, and so on) will identify the request and call the appropriate Request* method (RequestInformation, RequestData, etc.) as appropriate.

Is there any brave guy (maybe a Sandia's folk) successfully working with the
following exotic combination?

Exodus II, Windows and Fortran

(well, it _should not_ be exotic)

If so, how could you manage such "miracle" (without using Cygwin or a bunch
of huge third party libraries/shells/compilers would be the desirable
answer...)?

I've never used Exodus II format since it's quite hard to use in Windows
machines...

Thanks for any discussion

Renato.

p.s. (1): I'm not a Windows defensor, but, portability, for me, is a key
issue.

p.s. (2): I'm posting such question in the ParaView/VTK lists because I'm
pretty sure there are ExodusII users here.

Bart,

You can create a writer of the type you want eg.
XMLUnstructuredGridWriter and set the input etc. exactly as I did for
the example I sent you.  Writing CSV through python is not possible
through 3.4, if I remember correctly.

Is there any brave guy (maybe a Sandia's folk) successfully working with the following exotic combination?

Exodus II, Windows and Fortran

(well, it _should not_ be exotic)

If so, how could you manage such "miracle" (without using Cygwin or a bunch of huge third party libraries/shells/compilers would be the desirable answer...)?

I've never used Exodus II format since it's quite hard to use in Windows machines...

Thanks for any discussion

Renato.

p.s. (1): I'm not a Windows defensor, but, portability, for me, is a key issue.

p.s. (2): I'm posting such question in the ParaView/VTK lists because I'm pretty sure there are ExodusII users here.

In some sense, yes. I mean, I know that Exodus II has Fortran bindings and
that it _should be_ easily compiled using CMake, even in Windows machines.
The problem is that I've never got success in compiling Exodus II in
Windows. Ok, it must be a problem with me... but it's not as easy as compile
VTK or ParaView and there's much more improvements to be done (my opinion).

Exodus II depends on Netcdf library. Netcdf, in my opinion, has a poor
support for Windows. Compile Netcdf using the source code, in Windows, seems
to be almost impossible... The library itself can be wonderful, but, with
poor portability it looses all of its power (my opinion again). Well, at
least there's something in the link
http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/netcdf-install/Building-and-Installing-NetCDF-on-Windows.html...
Ok, I downloaded this Netcdf precompiled library and tried to compile
Exodus II using CMake and got a bunch of error messages. It's frustrating...
(not to mention that weird requirement of C header adjustment to manage
large files... but it's another history...)

HDF5 is so much easier to use that I just decided to stick with Xdmf format.
The problem is that ParaView seems to be Exodus II driven for much of its
parallel resources. Every time I try to do something more complicated in
ParaView, I'm adviced that the resource is not available for the file format
I'm using.

Anyway, I'm sure there's people out there using Exodus II in Windows
machines (at least in Sandia labs). Including Fortran users. I was just
curious to know how these people managed to do that...

Hi,

I have been reading Paraview Scripting with Python document.
I have installed  paraview from ubuntu repository. Everything was
working ok for following script (I could see a cone on the pop-up window as
in
Paraview Scripting with Python manual).

I decided to download the source code and build it from scratch. It was ok
Paraview was working correctly, but now this script works but I got
blank pop-up windows and don't see the cone any more.


do yo have any idea what might have been gone wrong?

Thanks,


from paraview import servermanager
import time
import os

connection=servermanager.Connect('localhost')
coneSource = servermanager.sources.ConeSource()
coneSource.Resolution = 32
coneSource.Center[0:3]=[1,2,3]

shrinkFilter = servermanager.filters.ShrinkFilter(Input=coneSource)

shrinkFilter.UpdatePipeline()
shrinkFilter.UpdatePipelineInformation()

view = servermanager.CreateRenderView()
rep = servermanager.CreateRepresentation(shrinkFilter, view)
view.StillRender()
view.ResetCamera()
view.StillRender()

Is the render window popping up behind some other window?
Try capturing an image using:
view.WriteImage("C:/temp/image.png", "vtkPNGWriter", 1)
Is that blank too?

I just tried to add the CubeAxesRepresentation via python scripting using Paraview 3.4. Within the script I read some VTK-file, get its cell data, add a color legend and save the screenshot as png-file. It looks like the following:


from paraview import servermanager as sm
reader = sm.sources.LegacyVTKFileReader(FileNames=fname)
reader.UpdatePipeline()
rv  = sm.CreateRenderView()
rep = sm.CreateRepresentation(reader, rv)
rep.Representation = 2   # 0 (Points), 1 (Wireframe), 2 (Surface), 3 (Outline)
...
lt = sm.rendering.PVLookupTable()
rep.LookupTable = lt
...
bar = sm.rendering.ScalarBarWidgetRepresentation()
bar.LookupTable = lt     # assign the lookup table to the color bar
...
axes = sm.rendering.CubeAxesRepresentation()
axes.Visibility = 1 
axes.Color = [0,0,0]      # get it in black
...
rv.Representations.append(bar)
rv.Representations.append(axes)
rv.WriteImage(fname_out,"vtkPNGWriter",1)


I get the following messages:

ERROR: In /home/berk/Work/ReleaseBuilds/ParaView3/Servers/ServerManager/vtkSMDataRepresentationProxy.cxx, line 118
vtkSMCubeAxesRepresentationProxy (0xa485748): CreateVTKObjects() must be called before AddToView.This typically implies that the input to the representation was not set before adding it to the view.

vtkSMRenderViewProxy (0xa117020): vtkSMCubeAxesRepresentationProxy cannot be added to view of type vtkSMRenderViewProxy


I just don't know which 'Input' I have to set (must be sth like 'axes.Input = ...').
Any hints will be helpful. Thanks in advance...

Hello,
I am a new Paraview user. I saw that it can be possible to open a file at
the start of Paraview with the option --data=my_file.
So my quesion is :
 - Is it possible to open multiple files with this option, knowing than this
files are not files serie like my0.vtk, my1.vtk ...  ?

Subject: [Paraview]  How to plot Surface StreamLines
Message-ID: <49DDC2E2.4020902@onera.fr>

Hello,

I am trying to plot streamlines on the surface of an aircraft using 
Paraview 3.40.
My data contain a multiblock structured surface grid only (no volume) 
with a 3 component vector at each point of the grid (may be the surface 
velocity vector from Euler flow computation or the skin friction vector 
from NS computations) .
I try to follow the example given in 
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Custom_Filters for creating a custom 
Surface Streamlines filter but I get only short lines from the seed points.
Also I can reproduce the example given in 
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Custom_Filters with a slice by a plane but 
this example does not work if the slice is not a plane (trying with a 
sphere). I don't undestand how to obtain surface streamlines if the 
surface is not a plane.
Is there an example or a tutorial for surface streamlines on non planar 
surfaces?
Thanks in advance.

Utkarsh, Berk, and I just discussed this yesterday.  Our current plan is to branch in 6 weeks from now (during which time we try to address the bugs slated for 3.6).  After that it should take about 2 weeks to get the release ready.  According to my calendar, that puts the release at early June.

The single .vtm file is wrapper that links multiple .vts file. Reading a

Hi again,

I found a way that seems to work, but I still have a problem.
The StringVectorProperty I'm using look like this:

      <StringVectorProperty
         name="Arrays"
         command="SetArrays"
         repeat_command="1"
         number_of_elements_per_command="2"
         element_types="2 0">
      </StringVectorProperty>

to connect this property to a Qt SLOT, I used:

vtkSmartPointer<vtkEventQtSlotConnect> VTKConnect =
                            vtkSmartPointer<vtkEventQtSlotConnect>::New();
VTKConnect->Connect(arrays, vtkCommand::ModifiedEvent,
		this, SLOT(onArraysModified()));

because repeat_command=1 the SLOT will be called every time an element
is modified in the StringVectorProperty
and that will cause a slow excecution if the number of elements in the
StringVectorProperty is to big.
Is there a way around this ?

Hi,

I tried to write  png file (view.WriteImage("image.png", "vtkPNGWriter",1)
), and I got following error

Warning: In
/home/yildirim/projects/ParaView3/Servers/ServerManager/vtkSMRenderViewProxy.cxx,
line 1110
vtkSMIceTDesktopRenderViewProxy (0x2630390): Disabling offscreen rendering
since empty image was detected.

and image is blank too (visualized with gimp)

Thanks,

Hmm, I am not sure what's happening. Try changing the background color
of the view to something non-black. Is the color being updated?

view.Background = [1, 0, 0]

There;s no direct way around this. You can handle it in use Qt code by
using a singleshot timer and calling some other slot only on idle.
Alternatively try to look at the code that's modifying the "Array"
property. Instead of using the SetElement() API, change it to using
the SetElements() API which modifies all elements and then fires the
modified event.

Hi again,

My background would be updated (still black) even when I tried to use
view.Background = [1,0,0].

Thanks,

Only a file series or a single file can be opened by specifying a
command line option, and not just a random set of multiple files. This
is consistent with the gUI behavior which does not allow users to open
multiple files (unless it's a file series) without hitting Apply after
each reader.

Message-ID: <971D3AAAE60F3241973E4DFA762F548806CE2C4C65@ivdis5.ivdwin.ivd.uni-stuttgart.de>

Is there an option to define the size of a color bar? Except that, everything is working quite fine using the ScalarBarWidgetRepresentation(). Just the size seems too large and I can't any switch for that issue... (see also appendix)
My script looks like that:
...
        # Format of the color bar     ### TODO size of bar !!!
        bar = sm.rendering.ScalarBarWidgetRepresentation()
        bar.Visibility  = 1           # switch on color bar
        bar.LookupTable = lt          # assign the lookup table to the color bar
        bar.TitleColor = [0,0,0]      # switch to black
        bar.LabelColor = [0,0,0]      # switch to black
        bar.TitleFontSize = 10
        bar.LabelFontSize = 10
        bar.AutomaticLabelFormat = 0  # switch off, to modify the format
        bar.LabelFormat   = "%-#8.2f" # format of labels
        bar.AspectRatio   = 15
        bar.Position  = [0.85,0.1]    # relative position of bar and labels
        rv.Representations.append(bar)
...

Thanks in advance!

Bart,

Please cc the mailing list as well so other can use this information
as well as respond.

I think one dubious statement I see in your code is:
## First save points.
convertor = sm.filters.AttributeDataToTableFilter(Input=filter1Output,
  FieldAssociation="Points",
  AddMetaData=1)

You are setting the input to this filter be the data object returned
by using Fetch(). In ParaView python scripts the input to filters
cannot be other data objects, but filters or sources. So, the proper
usage would be:

convertor = sm.filters.AttributeDataToTableFilter(Input=filter1,
  FieldAssociation="Points",
  AddMetaData=1)

Does that solve the issue? Also creation of the representation is not
necessary unless you are rendering into a view, which doesn't seem to
be the case.

Utkarsh,

I used the CVS from yesterday but it returns :
      Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<string>", line 41, in <module>
      AttributeError: 'PVModule' object has no attribute
'AttributeDataToTableFilter'
     
I have not used the following as the Connect part did not work, perhaps
thats the cause?
I replaced the sm by servermanager.
       from paraview import servermanager as sm
       sm.Connect()

bar.Position2 can be used to control the size. It's the normalize
display size relative to the Position.

Can you give your full script? If you are not calling Connect() at
all, it won't work since Connect() is required.

Ok, than that should be the problem I guess;

Here's my "full" script, almost the same as provided before:

from paraview import servermanager as sm
sm.Connect()

###############################################################################################
# create implicit device to populate Slice
impPlane =
sm.implicit_functions.Plane(registrationGroup='implicit_fuctions')
###############################################################################################

caseName = 'Case'
caseLocation = '/home/bart/Desktop/Test_Python/'
showScalarBar = 2 #0=none, 1=vertical, 2=horizontal

#read data
VTKreader01 =
sm.sources.LegacyVTKreader(FileNames='/home/bart/Desktop/Test_Python/1/VTK/1_1000.vtk',registrationGroup='sources',registrationName='RR')

Slice_in =
sm.filters.Slice(registrationGroup='sources',registrationName='slice02',Input=VTKreader01)
Slice_inprop = Slice_in.GetProperty('CutFunction')
domainSlice_in = Slice_inprop.GetDomain('proxy_list')
domainSlice_in.AddProxy(impPlane.SMProxy)

cutplane_in = impPlane
cutplane_in.Normal = [0, 1, 0]
cutplane_in.Offset = 0
cutplane_in.Origin = [0, 0, 0]
Slice_in.SliceType= cutplane_in

Calculator01 =
sm.filters.Calculator(registrationGroup='sources',registrationName='calculator',Input=Slice_in)
Calculator01.ResultArrayName = 'Pt'
Calculator01.Function = '1.225*p+0.5*1.225*mag(U)^2'
Calculator01.AttributeMode = 1 # 1=pointdata,2=celldata
Calculator01.VectorVariable = ['U','U','0','1','2']
Calculator01.ScalarVariable =
['p','p','0','U_0','U','0','U_1','U','1','U_2','U','2']

filter1 =
sm.filters.IntegrateVariables(registrationGroup='sources',registrationName='Integrator',Input=Calculator01)

## AttributeDataToTableFilter converts any dataset to a vtkTable which can
be
## written as a CSV file. One needs to choose which attribute to save as
well.
## First save points.
convertor =
sm.filters.AttributeDataToTableFilter(Input=filter1,FieldAssociation="Points",AddMetaData=1)
csvWriter = sm.writers.CSVWriter(Input=convertor)
csvWriter.FileName = "/home/bart/Desktop/Test_Python/output.points.csv"

## this writes the output.
csvWriter.UpdatePipeline()

### Now save cells.
convertor.FieldAssociation="Cells"
csvWriter = sm.writers.CSVWriter(Input=convertor)
csvWriter.FileName = "/home/bart/Desktop/Test_Python/output.cells.csv"

### this writes the output.
csvWriter.UpdatePipeline()


when trying to Connect it gives:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 2, in <module>
  File

Oh, are you running the script through the python shell in the
ParaView client? In that case, sorry, but you don't need the Connect()
:). I assumed you were using pvpython.

Are you sure you built your paraview after updating? I just tried the
CVS and I indeed have the AttributeDataToTableFilter.

Hello again,

I did ran it from the python shell, so that problem is fixed.
I just updated the CVS and built the update, but still not
AttributeDataToTableFilter :(
not in dir(servermanager.filters) nor in dir(servermanager)

When looking for files I can find the vtkAttributeDataToTableFilter.cxx and
.h but this is not available as well.

Bart

If there's no Servers/Filters/vtkAttributeDataToTableFilter.h and
Servers/Filters/vtkAttributeDataToTableFilter.cxx then I am guessing
you are not updating correctly. There may be some sticky tags set with
your CVS checkout. Can you look at
ParaView3/VTK/Utilities/kwsys/kwsysDataStamp.cmake and verify that the
date mentioned is indeed today's?

I am using ParaView3.4.0 with Qt4.5.0.  I have solved the 3 
colorScalarBar issues, but I still have the timer hack in place.  Are 
there any pq/qt triggers available that will tell me when a new 
pipeLineRepresentation has been added?

Thanks, Chris

Look at pqServerManagerModel. It fires signals when a representation
is created. The pqServerManagerModel can be accessed from the
pqApplicationCore using
pqApplicationCore::instance()->getServerManagerModel().

Try updating your graphics drivers. Hopefully someone else on the
mailing list has run into a similar issue  knows how to overcome it.

Bart,

Make sure your paraview is built as correctly. Then
import sys
print sys.path

Ensure that the path does not include any old version of paraview

  When I run ccmake for the ParaView build, the option: BUILD_SHARED_LIBS
  gives me the help string: Build Verdict with shared libraries.
  Am I right in thinking that this option affects more than Verdict?

  thanks

Yes, it _should_ build shared libraries for everything.

Subject: [Paraview]  How to plot Surface StreamLines
Message-ID: <49DE2236.8070801@onera.fr>

Hello,

This is an addition to my previous mail about Surface Streamlines:

After several tests, I can obtain some pieces of surface Streamlines on 
non planar surfaces (with the Wiki example for Custom Filter as with my 
own data). I have to use a very low value of "Initial Step Length" of 
the Custom StreamTracer, but I get always more or less short pieces of 
streamlines. never a full streamline from the seed point to the border 
of the surface. So I have to put many seed points all over the surface 
to cover the surface with pieces of streamlines in order to have an idea 
of the surface flow.

What I would like to get is a full streamline extending over the whole 
surface from  a given seed point.  As an example, let us consider the 
fuselage of an aircraft. I would like to put some seed points on a 
circle around the fuselage at a given location on the aircraft axis. The 
seed points may be obtained using Mask Point on a Slice of the fuselage 
by a plane at the desired location on the axis. Then a Surface Vectors 
filter is applied to the fuselage dataset and the Custom StreamTracer is 
applied to the Surface Vectors. But all I can obtain is always more or 
less short (depending of the "Initial Step Length" value) pieces of 
surface streamlines extending around the seed points.

Is there a way to have full surface streamlines with the existing 
filters other than including LC or some other software?

Thank you in advance for your help.

Hi everybody,
I have updated graphics drivers, there is nothing wrong with that. I have
used "paraview-3.4.0-Linux64-x86.tar.gz" again and it is working fine and I
am not getting any blank screen. But, I want to do exactly the same thing
for
my own build.

I think that some options which I turned "ON" in compilation caused the
problem,  Do you think that it is possible?

Thanks,

When I create a 100^3 wavelet and clip it with a sphere of radius 20,
I am getting a volume of 33447.5 which is pretty close to the analytic
value of 33510.3. Can you send me a dataset that demonstrates this
problem?

You can't, yet. I am working on that feature for the next release.

Let me ask a question back : do you have any Python knowledge? We are
working on making this really simple but currently the array
calculator is too limited and cannot produce tensors. However, this is
doable using the programmable filter.

Hi again,

I only turn BUILD_SHARED_LIBS, PARAVIEW_ENABLE_PYTHON, PARAVIEW_USE_MPI  on
(default was "off").

My version from paraview repository shows that it is 3.5, do you think that
I should go with 3.4 source?

thanks,

Message-ID: <245222690904091822l1459bfc8rf177d7c2467b3e8e@mail.gmail.com>

Hello, everyone!
I am working on developing some Object_Panel_Plugins with QT Designer.
Now I have a question about how to name the widget.
I have known that if you want the paraview to hook up the server manager
objects with the widgets you designed, you should name them with the
correspond name. But if the widgets have more than one parameters, how
should I name them?
Let me give a simple example, the Source cone have parameters of Resolution,
Radius, Height and Center, and the parameters Center have 3 elements,. So
how can I name the 3 lineEdit components in my QT Designer to place the
three elements?
Thank you very much!

Message-ID: <49DEE9A6.4050600@cscs.ch>

I ran a dashboard set of tests prior to committing my most recent time 
related fixes, but as you can see from the list below, I get a lot of 
errors in my ctest.

a couple of pqClientXXX tests do pass, but nearly all fail. I'm not 
worried about headertesting & temporal fails, but where should I be 
looking for the pqClient*** fails?

What's the first thing I should check. Dashboard submit failed, so I 
can't "see" what went wrong. I'll try again, but as it takes about 12 
hours to complete, I need a head start.

thanks

Subject: [Paraview] visualising a network of tubes and spheres using python
	programmable filter

Dear paraview,

Following the examples given in paraview wiki, i have made a script to
create a network of lines. After that I apply  both tube and glyph(sphere)
filter on it and the resulting
view is attached in the figure. But what i would like to have is to be able
to create varying tube radius and varying sphere radius. Ihave the radii of
each tube and sphere in a file and i like to be able to get this into
paraview. Any help in this regard is appreciated.
here is a sample script.

##---------------------script-----------------##
#!/usr/bin/python
#This is intended as the script of a 'Programmable Source'
#Get a paraview.vtk.PolyData object for the output
pdo = self.GetPolyDataOutput()
filename="network.dat"
#Allocate the number of 'cells' that will be added. We are just
#adding one vtkPolyLine 'cell' to the vtkPolyData object.
no_of_tubes=7
pdo.Allocate(no_of_tubes, 1)
#This will store the points for the lines
newPts = vtk.vtkPoints()
offset=0
file=open(filename,'r')
lines=file.readlines()
for line in lines:
   # skip lines starting comment char #
   point=0
   if line[0]=='#':
      pass
   else:
      #read x,y,z values
      #check 3d or 2d network
      #end points of tube (x1,y1,z1) & (x2,y2,z2)
      if(len(line.split())==6):
         x1 = float(line.split()[0])
         x2 = float(line.split()[3])
         y1 = float(line.split()[1])
         y2 = float(line.split()[4])
         z1 = float( line.split()[2])
         z2 = float( line.split()[5])
      else:
         x1 = float(line.split()[0])
         x2 = float(line.split()[2])
         y1 = float(line.split()[1])
         y2 = float(line.split()[3])
         z1=0.0
         z2=0.0
     #Insert the Points into the vtkPoints object
     #The first parameter indicates the reference.
     #value for the point. Here we add them sequentially.
     #Note that the first point is at index 0 (not 1).
      newPts.InsertPoint(point+offset, x1,y1,z1)
      point+=1
      pdo.SetPoints(newPts)
      #print x1,y1,z1
      newPts.InsertPoint(point+offset, x2,y2,z2)
      point+=1
      pdo.SetPoints(newPts)

      #print x2,y2,z2
     #Add the points to the vtkPolyData object
     #Right now the points are not associated with a line -
     #it is just a set of unconnected points. We need to
     #create a 'cell' object that ties points together

     #A 'cell' is just an object that tells how points are
     #connected to make a 1D, 2D, or 3D object.

     #Make a vtkPolyLine which holds the info necessary
     #to create a curve composed of line segments. This
     #really just hold constructor data that will be passed
     #to vtkPolyData to add a new line.
   aPolyLine = vtk.vtkPolyLine()
     #Indicate the number of points along the line
   aPolyLine.GetPointIds().SetNumberOfIds(point)

         #the order of the point on the line. The second value
         #is a reference to a point in a vtkPoints object. Depends
         #on the order that Points were added to vtkPoints object.
         #Note that this will not be associated with actual points
         #until it is added to a vtkPolyData object which holds a

Another problem, when i tried to take a screenshot using paraview menu
(file->save screenshot), the paraview got crashed saying Segmentation fault
. I am using paraview linux version 3.4.0 in debian lenny. What would be the
problem?

thank you,
Sreejith

Here's the data replied by the import sys and print sys.path
It shows no old versions. I also included the filters with
dir(servermanager.filters)

I would try :

- diminishing the step size (in cell length)
- Putting a very high number of steps
- Decreasing the termination speed

hey Utkarsh,

I'm sorry that my writing was a bit unclear, but I said that I can find the
.cxx and .h files, but I can't find them in the dir(servermanager) and
dir(servermanager.filters).

The dataStamp.cmake contains this, (today indeed):

# Do not edit!  Generated by kwsysDateStamp.py

# KWSys version date year component.  Format is CCYY.
SET(KWSYS_DATE_STAMP_YEAR  2009)

# KWSys version date month component.  Format is MM.
SET(KWSYS_DATE_STAMP_MONTH 04)

# KWSys version date day component.  Format is DD.
SET(KWSYS_DATE_STAMP_DAY   09)

I tried this. The best results are obtained with a step size of 0.01 
cell length on my data,and I get always short peaces of surface streamlines.
I discovered that the grid refinement was also an important parameter:
- when the grid is coarse at the seed point location, the surface 
streamline stops after crossing only one or two cells.
- when the grid is well refined at the seed point location, the surface 
streamline is longer and propagates over many cells, but it never 
reaches the boundary of the surface.

So I think that the best workaround is to put many seed points all over 
the surface. If someone has a better idea...

Best regards.

Out of curiosity, did you do a "make install" and are you running from
the installed version of ParaView? If so, just to confirm, you redid
the make install after building, right?

Ok, I'll try it once more, but I have tried that before. We'll see what
happens.
As I am not available until wednesday I will let you know by then.

Thanks for help so far,

Hmm ok. Sorry, I just can't seem to reproduce it here. It maybe
something silly as it bringing in old libraries or something like
that.

No problem, I'll try it again and we'll see.
And if you maybe come up with another solution for writing out the
integrated variables, just let me know.

With regards,

Thanks Utkarsh. This will solve the problem.
I have another question:
to get the array from the client, I implemented a method in my server
side that look like this:
void SetArrays(const char *array, int state).
This works perfectly but what if my StringVectorProperty was an
information_only property that I want to set in the server side and
display in the client.
How can I set the element of an information_only StringVectorProperty
that looks like this in the server side: ?
      <StringVectorProperty
         name="Arrays"
         command="GetArrays"
         repeat_command="1"
         number_of_elements_per_command="2"
         element_types="2 0"
         information_only=1>
      </StringVectorProperty>

Thank you,
Nehme

IN that case you'll have to use a what's called an information helper.
Look at vtkSMInformationHelper and subclasses.

Hello,

you may try to first project the velocity vector on the surface, so  
that the normal components are zero, then compute the streamlines  
using this velocity field. I did this with a velocity field which was  
defined as a cell data, and the results are good (at least in my  
case...).

Hi Berk,

Thanks for looking at my questions.

1) I attached a sample data set: test.vtk, and the screenshot of my
paraview window, from which you can see that the clip is created at
(0,0,0) with radius of 50e-6, and the calculated volume is
3.32862e-13, which is much less than what it should be.
(Interestingly, in this specific case, the calculated volume is about
2/pi times the real volume.)

2) Thanks for letting me know.

3) Unfortunately, I have no experience with Python. Now I am trying to
see if I can use matlab to do the tensor calculates and modify the vtk
file readable by paraview.

Regards,
Jie

Subject: [Paraview] U3D and X3D
Message-ID: <66341C01-4A33-4BB2-A901-D148C9E3107E@usace.army.mil>

Hi,

Is anybody working on tools for exporting U3D from paraview? I noticed  
that we can export some information in other 3D modeling formats like  
VRML and X3D, but since our group often produces reports and  
presentations by using LaTeX to generate PDF, I thought it might be  
nice to try including U3D because it is supported by adobe reader. The  
U3D standard and an example are here:

http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-363.htm
http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/pdfs/3d_pdf_demo.pdf

The results look nice. On the other hand, it looks like X3D is a much  
nicer/more open format, and I found one blog that makes  me worry that  
it would be a waste of time to pursue U3D at all:

http://my2iu.blogspot.com/2005/04/u3d-is-half-baked.html

I did find one tool called meshlab (http://meshlab.sourceforge.net)  
that can read a lot of the input and output formats of paraview and  
export U3D, but the binary I downloaded seems to have a bug in the U3D  
exporter.

Anyway, I'd be interested in any views on this, as it's out of my area  
of expertise.  I realize the focus of paraview is on massive 3D data  
sets so maybe I need to be using a different tool like meshlab when I  
want to work with simpler/smaller boundary representations once I've  
extracted them with paraview.  I suppose one could also make the  
argument that we should get away from adobe reader and focus on web  
browsers with 3D modeling plugins for these kinds of reports.

Chris

It seems rounding errors... try to scale your model at least 100x to see
what happens...

Just to reforce Jie Xu's problem. It's not the first time the Integrate
Variable presents issues in volume calculations. Take a look:
http://markmail.org/message/67dkxpypfodylfnr#query:volume%20integration%20paraview%20renato+page:1+mid:67dkxpypfodylfnr+state:results

In my case, I don't remember if the problem was solved....

I tried to find my dataset to test it again but I haven't found (yet)....
:-(

Renato.

Hi Jie, Renato,

There had been a bug until ParaView 3.4 that led the volume of a wedge
to have been miscalculated as a negated volume of a tetrahedron.
http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2008-August/009246.html
http://paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=7588

The bug has been fixed with the recent CVS versions.

I can confirm that the bug also affects volume calculations of clipped
hexahedral meshes as well by Jie's test.vtk. If I try the .vtk with a
CVS version and follow Jie's procedure I get a volume of 4.95177e-13
which is closer to the analytic value of 5.23599e-13. However if I
revert the bugfix (revert vtkWedge.cxx from the current revision 1.7
to ParaView 3.4's 1.5) I get the identical value with what Jie got,
3.32862e-13.

I'm forwarding this question to the mailing list because I am not sure.  I recall a lot of talk about aggregated operations like sum in context with the programmable filter, but I don't remember if there is a way to do it outside that.

Subject: sum of values at all nodes

Ken,
Is it possible to get a sum of all variables from all nodes into one number?  Are we planning on adding this for the future?

Subject: [Paraview] python function documentation?
Message-ID: <c19fcadc0904110757v5c4b8002o6cbd269497dde6a2@mail.gmail.com>

I am doing something like this:

--------------
view=servermanager.CreateRenderView()
#render something
view.WriteImage("top.png", "vtkPNGWriter")
--------------

I can find help with
help(servermanager)
or
help(servermanager.CreateRenderView)

but not with

help(servermanager.CreateRenderView.WriteImage)

I was trying to figure out how to change the image size or see what other
writes are available, things like that. I can't seem to find documentation.
I found this:
http://www.paraview.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkPVRenderView.html

But it doesn't have a WriteImage() function, so I guess I'm not in the right
place?

Can someone point me in the right direction?

Thanks,

David

Try the vtk documentation.  I think this page might be what you're looking for.

http://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkImageWriter.html

Hope that helps,
Peter.

Hm I still don't see anything about how to set the size of the image? And I
also don't know how I would have found vtkImageWriter from WriteImage(),
when WriteImage() is not an actual function anywhere in the vtk docs.  And
the same kind of thing, I thought maybe size would be changed in my:

view=servermanager.CreateRenderView()
rep = servermanager.CreateRepresentation(reader, view)

instead of in the actual writing step, but I didn't see servermanager in the
vtk docs. Also, I found a vtkCameraRepresentation, but it doesn't look like
this is the same thing created by CreateRepresentation. I found
vtkRenderView, and in vtkView (the parent class) there is a SizePort(i , j)
function, but how would you call that from python? I think the main issue is
that python doesn't require the variables to be typed and hence I don't know
what they actually are.

Thanks,

David

Message-ID: <5CA8EE28-38DA-4BDC-A052-8B8AB2AB1F2A@videotron.ca>

Good morning,

I've been trying to compile ParaView with Cocoa 64Bit support over the  
last few day using the instructions from
the previous posts in the thread http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2009-March/011281.html

Basically I have :

1) Compiled qt-4.5 using flags -cocoa and -arch x86_64
2) Compiled cmake-2.6.3
3) Downloaded ParaView from CVS and applied patches pv-cocoa.patch and  
qt-cocoa.patch
4) In the configuration process, enabled VTK_USE_64BIT_IDS,  
BUILD_SHARED_LIBS and PARAVIEW_ENABLE_PYTHON

I have the following errors when compiling :

[ 44%] Built target vtkViewsPython
Linking CXX shared library ../../../../bin/libvtkQtChart.dylib
ld warning: in /opt/qt-4.5.0-64/lib/QtGui.framework/QtGui, file is not

...

Any idea or suggestions ?

Looks like the qt libs are not 64 bit.

You can check the arch of the shared libraries and object files you've  
built  using the 'file' comand. It may be paraview that's being built  
as i386. Did you set CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES to x86_64? I'm guessing  
you will also need to built python as 64 bit if you enable it.

Hi David,

I agree that it can be a bit of a frustrating scavenger hunt.  I'm not
sure what platform you're using but it will pay off if you get
familiar with 'find' and 'grep' commands to dig through the paraview
source.  In the meantime I think you're looking for something like,

view.ViewSize = [number, number] to set the gui size.
You can use something like 'view.ParallelScale' to zoom in (that's not
the exact command but it should be listed in dir(view)).

Good luck,
Peter.

Thanks Peter - good idea about grepping the source - that just always seems
like a last resort so I wanted to make sure I wasn't being silly and missing
some nice documentation some where first.

.ViewSize looks like what I was asking for, I'll give that a shot.

Thanks,

David

You need to set the CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES to x86_64. By default they  
build as i386 (32 bit)

I would also suggest NOT building with Python at first. See if you can  
actually get the 64 bit to build first, then start adding things.

  I have already run into a number of issues with the cocoa build of  
Qt 4.5. QTreeViews do not respond to user clicks and there are also  
menu issues within applications. Drag and Drop seems pretty buggy  
also. I think I'll probably wait for the next few point releases in Qt  
4.5 before trying again.

Good luck. Keep the list posted on how things go as there are more  
than a few people interested in the technology.

I am not sure I understand. You need to associate time values with
various vts files? Why not use pvd then?

Hi Richard,

If you have an example dataset you can share, I would like to play
around a bit. The reason the streamlines are terminating prematurely
is because streamlines are leaving the surface because of integration
inaccuracy. Making sure that all of the velocity values are tangential
to the surface would help but not necessarily fix the issue. What
needs to happen is a change in the algorithm that move the points back
to the surface when integration along the surface. I know someone who
has done this in the past. I'll check with him to see if he would
contribute his changes.

This would be super easy to do with the python calculator (which is
not committed). So, I would say the answer is "yes, we are working on
it".

Do I need to patch something else ?

I would try running ParaView from the build directory first before  
doing an "installation" or anything else. When a "make install" is  
performed there are lots of "fixups" to the frameworks and dylibs that  
are either produced or used by paraview. If one of these got missed  
then that might lead to what you are seeing. So try running from the  
build directory and lets see where that gets you..

Message-ID: <245222690904122326g3e272be7i59e0060aa9e11ec3@mail.gmail.com>

Hello, everyone!
I am trying to add a new source in the ParaView. So I just want to know how
can ParaView add a source label in the Source Menu.
In my opinion, when ParaView starts, it will search the source.xml file and
find out the source label in that file. And then set every label in the
Source lable. Am I right?
Thank you so much!

Hi berk,
I need to associate time values to vtm files which point to vts files. I
found the timestep attribute only in &quot;collection&quot; dataset, 
but my need is to associate the timestep value to the MultiBlock dataset of
vtm file. If it is not possible directly into the MultiBlock data set, 
can you send me a simple example of pvd file (with time step values) that
points to a set of vtm file?

Thank you very much.

Hi Berk,

My dataset is an Euler velocity field at the surface of an aircraft, so 
it's everywhere tangent to the surface. But the grid refinement is 
really an important parameter. The forebody has almost a constant 
section in the area where I put the seed points, but the mesh is coarse 
in the aircraft axis direction in this area, and the surface streamlines 
stop after crossing one or two cells. But at the wing root, the grid is 
well refined in all directions and I can obtain fuselage streamlines 
crossing many cells on a distance covering more than the wing root chord.

I am sorry but the datasets I am working on cannot be shared. But you 
can try the example for Custom filters in 
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Custom_Filters. The dataset is the 
disk_out_ref.ex2 from Sc07_paraview_tutorial_data.tar.gz.
In this example surface streamlines are plotted on a slice plane and I 
tried to replace the slice plane by a slice sphere. Of course this is 
not a good example as the vectors are not tangent to the plane or to the 
sphere before applying the "Surface Vectors" filter, but it works with a 
plane.

I agree with you concerning the fact that the point sould be moved back 
to the surface at each step of the integration. If such an improvement 
of the surface streamlines computation could be added in a future 
Paraview release, it would be really a nice feature. I am always keeping 
an eye on Paraview.

Best regards,

Hi Marzio

But is not it the purpose of the "Surface Vectors" filter that should be 
applied to the input vector field before calling the Custom 
StreamTracer? I don't know what this filter exactly does.
As I said to Berk in my last mail, my velocity field coming from Euler 
computations was supposed to be tangent to the surface, but it has been 
interpolated to the grid's nodes, so it's not cell data, and the quality 
of the surface grid seems to be very important. Maybe I would try later 
with some clean cell data.

Best regards.

Here is an example. Note that you need to use the vtmb extension
unless you are using the current development version in which case the
vtm extension is also ok.

That generally happens when you start dragging but move the mouse out
of the renderwindow before releasing the mouse button. Is that indeed
the case?

No, it does not have to do with the mouse outside the render window.
This is a bug with colorbar. To reproduce:

Load a dataset, slice it, color it with a scalar, display the colorbar.
Load another dataset, slice it, color it.
Now hide the first slice (unclick the eye).
The color legend is gone, but stays there hidden, faking the mouse. Move
the cursor to see false mouse-over effects. This now often results in
the mentioned "locking" while dragging with the middle button. It is the
 invisible colorbar that gets moved instead of the dataset and the whole
thing gets eventually stuck. It is extremely annoying, if not impossible
in case of complex pipeline states, to go through all entries and switch
off the colorbars. Is it possible to fix this?

I want to do a "fly around" of a model. I opened the animation inspector,
and chose "selected object: Camera", and click "add keyframe". Then under
"camera position" I clicked "Create path" (Because I want to leave the focal
point at (0,0,0) ).  The main paraview window disappears and a "Create

else experienced this? / Am I doing something wrong?

Thanks!

David,

Don't use the "Animation Inspector". It is  going to be deprecated in
the next release. Use the "Animation View" to create animations for
the camera. Another caveat, the camera animation functionality is
still a bit "raw", so expect some usability issues.

It works with a basic example:
1) Add a sphere source.
2) In "animate view", choose "Camera" and click the blue "Plus"
3) double click in the timeline near "Camera"
4) double click "path..." next to time "0"
5) click ok
6) click ok
7) click "play"

the sphere rotates as I expect.

However, when I do exactly the same thing, but with step 1 replaced by
opening a vtp file instead of adding a sphere source, nothing get animated
at all.  Sometimes when I click on the camera timeline the Time's are both
nan. It doesn't seem like the camera should be attached to either of these
objects, making it weird that it works in one case and not the other? Any
thoughts?

Thanks,

David

Check your play mode. Is it set to "Snap to Timesteps" and is ParaView
reporting that your dataset has only 1 timstep? Change the animation
play mode to Sequence and try.

Also if you are simply orbiting about the active object, you don't
have to do anything after step (2). It should by default create an
orbit about the object that's currently selected in the pipeline
browser.

I had tried all of the modes, and nothing changed. I tried again after your
response, stopping after step 2 and making sure it was on sequence mode and
still nothing was animated. Are you able to get the correct behavior? I've
tried it with a few different models with the same result, and I've done all
of those steps in every order I could imagine and tried setting the
start/end times in the animation view and in the "editing camera mode" to no
avail.

Thanks,

David

Message-ID: <36D74B4E-8A73-4B70-9E11-064627975049@cs.duke.edu>

Hey,

(Maybe this is a question specifically for John Biddiscombe, but I  
think others have contributed, too.)

Is there a particular reason that the Scalar Array combo box was  
dropped from the Particle Pathlines (vtkTemporalPathLineFilter) filter  
XML (gui) when it was brought into CVS ParaView? I always found that  
to be a really useful option so I could pass an attribute on to color  
the generated pathlines.

If people don't find it a confusing option, could we get it added back  
in?

Thanks a lot,
-Eric

When I download and install the 3.4.0 binary from paraview.org, I am missing documentation for all the sources, filters, readers, and writers.  When I click on, for example, the "Filters Menu" entry in the contents, I get the error that ParaViewFilters.html cannot be found.  This file does in fact appear to be missing from the distribution.

Hi,

I got a .vtk file with some scalar quantities given along the x and y coordinates (2D). I would like to plot these scalar quantities, say the temperature, in a 3D surface plot instead of just visualizing a 2D color map by default.

Thanks for the help!

Hugo.

Then select appropriate scalar and normal.

Oops.  This is my bad.  I made several improvements to the particle pathlines filter.  One of the improvements was to pass all of the field data to the pathline much like the streamlines filter does.  This makes the scalar array combo box obsolete.  However, I didn't check in the changes to the VTK filter because John asked me to hold off so that he could check in his own changes that have not yet migrated back to ParaView.  That was over a month ago.  Since then I errantly checked in my changes to filters.xml that removed the property you actually still need.  I'll back out those changes.

On a related note, John, hurry the heck up and check in those changes.  I'd like to improve the pathlines filter before the 3.6 release.

Ok. This is a nasty one. Before I tell you the fix, be aware that this
will change soon. We are working on cleaning up the animation time
issues that this is exposing. So here's the problem, you are loading a
dataset with single timestep. So ParaView switches to SnapToTimeSteps
mode and also enters a mode where the animation start and end times
are automatically determined based on the dataset. Inspite of changing
the play mode to sequence, it still remains in the mode where the
start and end times are determined by the dataset. Since that's just 1
time, the animation does not play. To fix this, go back the "Animation
Inspector" (remember this is going to be automated and cleaned up
soon), and then check the "Use custom end times" check box and specify
some animation end time which is not same as the animation start time.
Now try playing in the Sequence mode.

Subject: [Paraview] Animating the camera
In-Reply-To: <7ba9d6a30904150748q491e7aa9v206f967e6c0d2f91@mail.gmail.com>
Message-ID: <C60B5210.80B7%kmorel@sandia.gov>

Part of the problem is that the file series reader is reporting time even when you are loading a single file with no time in it.  In retrospect, that is probably not a good idea.  I just assigned a bug to myself to look into it.

Ok. This is a nasty one. Before I tell you the fix, be aware that this
will change soon. We are working on cleaning up the animation time
issues that this is exposing. So here's the problem, you are loading a
dataset with single timestep. So ParaView switches to SnapToTimeSteps
mode and also enters a mode where the animation start and end times
are automatically determined based on the dataset. Inspite of changing
the play mode to sequence, it still remains in the mode where the
start and end times are determined by the dataset. Since that's just 1
time, the animation does not play. To fix this, go back the "Animation
Inspector" (remember this is going to be automated and cleaned up
soon), and then check the "Use custom end times" check box and specify
some animation end time which is not same as the animation start time.
Now try playing in the Sequence mode.

Utkarsh,
Thanks for the patience, it worked! I'll track the bug that Ken added and
try it out when it is fixed.

Thanks,

David

Dear all,
Thinking that my question went unnoticed, i am sending it again. i would
appreciate any tips, in particular for displaying tubes with varying
diameter.
Thank you

Read in the sphere radii and tube radii as point data on the dataset
that you are creating. Both the glyph filter and the tube filter has
options that allow you to scale the glyph (and the tube) by point
data.

Subject: [Paraview] questions concerning axes and python...
Message-ID: <971D3AAAE60F3241973E4DFA762F548806CE2C4CCC@ivdis5.ivdwin.ivd.uni-stuttgart.de>

I have some questions concerning the tuning of the CubeAxesRepresentation(). I get the attached pngs using my script, which is looking something like that: 

...
rv.CreateRenderView(CameraParallelProjection=1)
...
axes = sm.rendering.CubeAxesRepresentation(Input=icut, Color[0,0,0])
axes.TickLocation = 1
axes.XTitle = ""
axes.YTitle = ""
axes.ZTitle = "" 
rv.Representations.append(axes)
...
rv.WriteImage(fname_out,"vtkPNGWriter",1)

1)  Is there a way to set the position of the labels for each axis? At the bottom, the numbers are above the axis and below the cut view. At the left the single-digit labels are on the left of the axis, while the double-digit labels are on the right of the axis and also below the cut view.
2)  Why are the major ticks on the left side missing?

I tried to change the FlyMode, but 1, 2, and 3 give the same result. With FlyMode 0, on the left all the labels are visible but still too close to the cut view, and the major ticks are still missing. If I switch to 'TickLocation = 0', then for all FlyModes there is the same result (test-cut-inside.png) with the correct major ticks, but still the same label problems...

Thanks for any hints.

Michael

Even simpler way to reproduce:

just move the (sliced) dataset with MMB onto the visible colorbar: a
lock results for me. Invisible datasets hide their colorbars, but they
are somehow still there, locking the navigation: a clear bug, at least
on my system.

Subject: [Paraview] creating very large data sets
Message-ID: <97d9bd670904151240w55c9dacap85427e0268b52276@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I want to create a few billion cell data set to do bench marking.  I thought
it would be useful to write a small
app to generate the data set and output the file into several pieces.  I
managed to get it working and it outputs
what I need and I can load this data correctly in paraview.  In short, I
create

vtkRectilinearGrid,
set dimensions of the grid,
pass this as input into vtkXMLPRectilinearGridWriter
and the job is done.

However, I am now faced with the problem, where I run out of memory when I
create the rectilinearGrid, like
vtkRectilinearGrid *grid = vtkRectilinearGrid::New();
grid->SetDimensions(2000,2000,2000);

and this falls over, because of lack of memory.  Is there a clever way to
get around this problem ?

Alternatively, I thought I can just loop over the number of pieces I want,
and create a rectilinear grid for each piece
and use the vtkXMLRectilinearGridWriter - this is also fine, but I am unable
to set the piece and whole extent correctly.

For example, if I define the problem as a 100,100,100 and want to write into
10 pieces, because now my grid dimension is
10,10,10 - the writer picks up the wholeextent from the grid, which says
10,10,10 - but in fact it should be 100,100,100 - if I manually
try to set this, I get an error saying my piece extent is outside the whole
extent.

Can some one please give me some pointers as to how I can solve this
problem?

Sreejith,

For two truly separate parts, create two separate *.vtu files. Each of 
the files should have a unique name (not really necessary for PV). PV is 
happy to read and display multiple datum sets -- even the same datum set 
twice. If you plan later to have many parts (for example, 100 parts), 
the collection can be aggregated with via a single *.pvd file (a 
meta-file or "mother-file"). Having PV read the single *.pvd file will 
load all of the *.vtu files referenced within the *.pvd file.

A good rule to follow is to have each part as a "standalone" displayable 
graphical object.

Later on when you want to process large sets of data, EnSight-formatted 
binary files incorporate a "part" concept. Also, the EnSight-formatted 
data set has constructs for parallel file sets, and multiple files for 
individual data streams to get around file size limitations.

I have a meta-reader that I wrote a while ago. It can handle series of
q files (also series of xyz files). I am too busy to test it now. I
hope that I can take a look at it soon.

Thank you for the tips. Yes , idea of having a pvd file to load  different
vtu files is good. I have tried that.  I was thinking that I can have kind
of multiblock data in same vtu file with each block with different data set.
I understand there is multiblock data format too for vtk files.  But dont
know the details and google search didnt give me enough information.

Hello Utkarsh,

Here I am again, but still no good results.
A complete rebuild was done but still no AttributeDataToTableFilter :(

Would it be possible to write the data in another way with Python, without
having to program new filters ?
So load VTK -> make Cut -> use calculator -> integrate -> export integrate
results.

Thanks, Bart

I have been trying many things but still not able to get what i wanted. For
instance; please find a polydata xml file i created for a small cubic
network (8 spheres and 12 tubes).

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<VTKFile type="PolyData" version="0.1" byte_order="LittleEndian">
<PolyData>
<Piece NumberOfPoints="8" NumberOfVerts="0" NumberOfLines="12"
NumberOfStrips="0" NumberOfPolys="0">
<Points>
<DataArray type="Float32" NumberOfComponents="3" format="ascii">
0 0 0
1 0 0
0 1 0
1 1 0
0 0 1
1 0 1
0 1 1
1 1 1
</DataArray>
</Points>
<Lines>
<DataArray type="Int32" Name="connectivity" format="ascii">
0 1 2 3 0 2 1 3 4 5 6 7 4 6 5 7 0 4 1 5 2 6 3 7
</DataArray>
<DataArray type="Int32" Name="offsets" format="ascii">
2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24
</DataArray>
</Lines>
<PointData Scalars="sph_dia">
<DataArray type="Float32" Name="sph_dia" format="ascii">
 2 5 6 8 9 4 3 8
</DataArray>
</PointData>
</Piece>
</PolyData>
</VTKFile>


If I read the above file with paraview and apply Glyph (sphere) and tube
filter, I can view the network with spheres and tubes. If i choose the scale
mode scalar and choose sph_dia, i can view spheres with different size.
Similarly If i choose "vary radius" option to tubes, the size of the tube is
varied based on the point data (sph_dia) and looks tapered (gradual change
in size) as shown in the attachment. But that is not I wanted. I have tube
diameter data and would like to be able to scale based on that and tube
should have uniform diameter from one end to the other.  Please let me know
if you have any suggestion or tips to attempt.

thank you

Message-ID: <20090416180037.17405bgszl5pr9k4@webmail.tu-harburg.de>

Hallo everybody,

I try to write a python script, that will read some data, process this  
in a filter pipeline and write a new file with the results. I am fine  
so far, but I need to use the calculator filter for something like that:

'coordZ - offset'

Can somebody point out how to use it? That is what I tried so far:

new_r = r
new_r = servermanager.filters.MergeBlocks(Input=new_r)
new_r = servermanager.filters.CleanUnstructuredGrid(Input=new_r)
new_r = servermanager.filters.CellDataToPointData(Input=new_r, PassCellData=0)
new_r = servermanager.filters.Contour(Input=new_r,ContourValues=[0.5],  
SelectInputScalars="AirVolumeFraction")
new_r = servermanager.filters.Calculator(Input=new_r,  
ResultArrayName="SurfaceElevation" )

---- up to here anything is fine

new_r.AddCoordinateVectorVariable

---- the error is:
    Syntax error: expecting a variable name; see position 0

    I need to assign something, but how?

---- The rest is then
new_r.Function = 'coordsZ - 0.5'
new_r.UpdatePipeline()

I am gratefull for any help.

Cheers Johannes

The tube filter only allows for using point data for scaling the
tubes. Another alternative is create two data sources one for the
sphere and one for the lines, and have duplicate points for the line
ends with appropriate point data to avoid the tapering. In the end you
can use AppendPolyData filter to append the two datasets into one.

Bart,

I will have to check, but I am not sure there was a CSV writer in 3.4.
I am out of town this week. Let me check it out and get back to you.

Thanks! If you wanted to you could send it over with a 2 line instruction and I can test it?! I'm not very familiar with Python (I use Perl a lot), but I'm sure I can figure something out...

Cheers,

I have a meta-reader that I wrote a while ago. It can handle series of
q files (also series of xyz files). I am too busy to test it now. I
hope that I can take a look at it soon.

Subject: [Paraview] Crash recovery on by default
Message-ID: <C60CCB8B.ACBA%kmorel@sandia.gov>

The new crash recovery feature, which records the state every time you hit the Accept button, is off by default.  Is there any reason why that should not be on by default?

It creates a state snapshot on every "Apply". Since saving state for
huge pipelines can be slow, it adversely affects the "Apply" response
time and hence it's off by default. Python tracing should overcome
this issue more gracefully.

I am guessing we forgot to explicitly build the HTMLDocumentation
target when those binaries were built.  I am adding a checklist to the
wiki.
http://paraview.org/ParaView3/index.php/ParaView3:Distribution_Checklist

Feel free to add to it. We should follow this checklist before any
binary is released. It will get easier with the VMs (and associated
scripts), but still we should have some checklist. Ideally, we may
want a test suite that we run on the installs which covers all these
things, but that may be a bit time consuming. Maybe we can address it
when we undertake the testing overhaul for 3.8 (?).

John,
If the client is running on the login/head node (with X-forwarding to my 
laptop) and from the client I want to start the parallel
backend I would enter the commands in the connect gui to choose a 
server. Have you ever tried using qsub this way?

Hi Jack,
  Usually you have to figure out what process 0 is going to be, so you  
get an interactive session using something like:
qsub -I -A myproject -q debug -V -lsize=64,walltime=20:00
which I use on one of the machines I use...

I then do an
mpirun -n 1 hostname
to find out the first node from MPI's perspective so I can connect to  
it with a client.

then:
mpirun -n 64 pvserver

If you are really trying to do batch I think there is still a pvbatch.

-John.

I have not tried a reverse connection from a batch job to a waiting  
client, but it sounds like it should work.  Have you tried using a  
normal batch script something like:
#PBS -A myproject
#PBS -N paraview
#PBS -j oe
#PBS -l walltime=00:01:00,size=512
cd /myparaviewbindir
mpirun  -n 512  ./pvserver  --reverse-connection --client- 
host=myheadnode


as an aside,
forwarding X is generally much slower than it has to be.
My environment makes it very difficult to get the reverse connection  
all the way to my desktop but i can do some port forwarding to get  
port 11111 from my desktop to the back end node.
ssh -L11111:process0:11111 myheadnode
which would probably work a lot better/faster than forwarding X
We have a some machines that have a gateway and then a front end node,  
which gets a lot more complicated, but can still be done with port  
forwarding.

Subject: [Paraview] Conflict with FindBoost.cmake included with paraview?
Message-ID: <811a1f290904161311s773ebf9fude6e24fd5c9421ee@mail.gmail.com>

I have using the PARAVIEW_EXTRA_EXTERNAL_MODULES method to compile my
plugin into paraview. My own code needs boost and makes its own calls
to find_package(..) to find boost. This works just fine with the
FindBoost.cmake that comes with CMake 2.6.3 so I know what I am doing
works correctly. Now when I run cmake on ParaView (Latest CVS) I get
the following error:


WARNING: You are using Qt 4.4.3. Officially supported version is Qt 4.3
-- [PVRoboMet] MXADATAMODEL_TARGET_ADDED: ''
-- Plugin: [PVRoboMet] adding MXADataModel Library
CMake Error at /Users/Shared/Kitware-CVS/ParaView3/VTK/CMake/FindBoost.cmake:362

  arguments specified).

  /Users/mjackson/Workspace/MXADataModel/Resources/CMake/FindSupportLibraries.cmake:13
(FIND_PACKAGE)
  /Users/mjackson/Workspace/MXADataModel/CMakeLists.txt:98 (INCLUDE)


-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!

The contents of my cmake file at the line where the error occurred is
the following:

SET (Boost_FIND_REQUIRED TRUE)
SET (Boost_FIND_QUIETLY TRUE)
set (Boost_USE_MULTITHREADED TRUE)
set (Boost_USE_STATIC_LIBS TRUE)

FIND_PACKAGE(Boost 1.36 COMPONENTS  program_options
unit_test_framework test_exec_monitor)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


I put in some debug statements into the FindBoost.cmake file and it
seems that the Boost_VERSION is not getting defined.
520:[mjackson at Ferb:Build]$ cmake ../
WARNING: You are using Qt 4.4.3. Officially supported version is Qt 4.3
-- [PVRoboMet] MXADATAMODEL_TARGET_ADDED: ''
-- Plugin: [PVRoboMet] adding MXADataModel Library

-- Boost_MINOR_VERSION:


And replacing the FindBoost.cmake with the one from CMake 2.6.3 allows
the configuration to proceed to completion without errors.

So would it be possible to update the FindBoost.cmake that is included
to the one from CMake 2.6.3?

Thanks
Mike Jackson

Dear all,
I build ParaView CVS with GL2PS enabled. Can somebody provide me a sample
python script how to use GL2PSExporter in ParaView? I can use that in vtk
but my problem is where the GL2PSExporter is located in ParaView.

Many thanks,

I'm sure there's a simpler way but when I used it in a script I had to do:

exp = vtkInstantiator.CreateInstance('vtkGL2PSExporter')

if I used it wrong but I found that the 'vtkPostScriptWriter' was able
to generate much better eps images than the vtkGL2PSExporter.

Good luck,
Peter.

I don't understand why the gui does not allow users to open multiple files.
Because user can hitting apply when he select a file in the plugin pipeline
browser. This is two separate operations. Is it a particular reason for this
kind of behavior?

Subject: [Paraview] Retrieving tuples from dataset
Message-ID: <BAY122-W523E1ED2BAEA63EBEC0286BC7B0@phx.gbl>


Hi!
I?m having trouble retrieving the data from a vector-valued vtkDoubleArray, my code looks like this:

double tuple[3]; //tuple should be stored in this array
scalars -> GetTupleValue(i,tuple);

The first component, i.e. tuple[0] is retrieved properly, but tuple[1] and tuple[2] are definitely wrong, does anyone see the reason? 
(the array has 3 components, that?s checked). 
Or is there any other method I could use?

thx,
Natalie

ParaView that allows a user to open multiple files from the GUI (
http://www.vtk.org/Bug/view.php?id=3D7344 ).

As far as doing it from the command line, I don't expect it would be
impossible to do.

Almost every time I open a file, I find myself immediately going and
changing the point size from 5 to 2, changing the colors to my color vector,
and changing the display type from "surface" to "point".  I have many
colleagues who complain about the same thing. If you open say 5 files, this
is an extra ~ 25 mouse clicks, which gets very tedious if you're doing this
all day. Is there anyway (besides editing the source, clearly) that we can
set these things to be defaults?

Thanks,

David

For what it's worth, I use reverse connect all the time to connect a server launched with pbs, and it works quite well (although you will have problems if your client is behind a firewall).  Reverse connection also has the added advantage of having the connection happen as soon as the pbs job launches; you don't have to guess how long the job is going to take to launch to connect to the server.

#PBS -l walltime=00:01:00,size=512
cd /myparaviewbindir
mpirun  -n 512  ./pvserver  --reverse-connection --client-
host=myheadnode


as an aside,
forwarding X is generally much slower than it has to be.
My environment makes it very difficult to get the reverse connection
all the way to my desktop but i can do some port forwarding to get
port 11111 from my desktop to the back end node.
ssh -L11111:process0:11111 myheadnode
which would probably work a lot better/faster than forwarding X
We have a some machines that have a gateway and then a front end node,
which gets a lot more complicated, but can still be done with port
forwarding.

I also use reverse connection with Torque (same commands used by PBS).

Here it goes the script that I use to start my PV session (reverse
connection and offscreen rendering):

#====================================================================
#PBS -l nodes=1:ppn=8
#PBS -l walltime=12:00:00
#PBS -N pv-omp
#PBS -j oe
#PBS -V
# PBS -m ae
# PBS -M user at domain.ufrj.br

PVCLIENT=ip.to.pvclient.machine

export
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:/sw/shared/x86_64/paraview/openmpi/3.4.0/lib/paraview-3.4:/sw/shared/x86_64/Mesa/7.2/lib64

# change directory
cd ${PBS_O_WORKDIR}

# get the number of processors and nodes
NUM_PROC=`cat ${PBS_NODEFILE} | wc -l`

# mpi program launch
mpirun -np ${NUM_PROC} /sw/shared/x86_64/paraview/openmpi/3.4.0/bin/pvserver
--use-offscreen-rendering -rc -ch=${PVCLIENT}

#====================================================================

Of course, you'll need to leave your pvclient waiting the reverse
connection.

I hope it helps you...

Regards

Renato.

Subject: [Paraview] segmentation fault
Message-ID: <3b6093ef0904171005o29d1edd9ucd78194eee668e5e@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I am trying to install paraview such that I can do remote rendering
through python scripting without the time consuming difficulty of
having the render window pop up.  I've compiled mesa with osmesa
support inorder to take advantage of the --use-offscreen-rendering
option.

Everything compiled correctly and things start running but when I try
to write the image I get a segmentation fault.  I started paraview
under gdb and found the source of the segmentation fault when trying
to save an image:

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x00002aaab7c31f2a in vtkPNGWriter::WriteSlice ()

I'm using paraview 3.4 and mesa 7.4 on fedora 10.  Any ideas as to
what's causing this and how to fix it?

Thanks,
Peter.

In the mean time, you can do it via Tools->Python Shell and this script:

Start up paraview and apply wavelet source for example. Then open
python shell and do this:


Python 2.5.1 (r251:54863, Jan 13 2009, 10:26:13)

>>> mm = servermanager.filters.MinMax()
>>> mm.Operation = "SUM"
>>> print pm.GetProxiesInGroup("sources")
{('Wavelet1', '114'): <paraview.servermanager.Wavelet object at 0x2d9c9910>}
>>> wavelet = pm.GetProxy("sources", "Wavelet1")
>>> out = servermanager.Fetch(wavelet, mm)
applying operation
>>> out.GetPointData().GetArray("RTData").GetValue(0)

I don't mean to flood the list but after some investigation it appears
that the PNGWriter is the ONLY image writer that leads to a seg fault.
 All the others work fine.

Subject: [Paraview] Resize Data Arrays in Object Inspector
Message-ID: <c19fcadc0904171342n5fe82b10j363356a4f704965@mail.gmail.com>

In the Object Inspector, the Data Arrays box is usually about 1 line high,
making it very hard to see anything. If you resize the object inspector, the
Data Array's box gets a little bigger, but often I do not want everything
else in the Object Inspector to get bigger, just the Data Arrays. Is there a
way to change it so you can resize things inside the Object Inspector?

Thanks,

David

Subject: [Paraview] Bug in Slice representation or in my XML ?
Message-ID: <e7f43c4f0904180506u25eb9482va15d2e6af4223e3a@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list,
Please find attached an XML that will expose vtkImageGaussianSource and
vtkImageMagnitude to ParaView
First of all, vtkImageGaussianSource behaves like it does not produce any
data :
   - Add a Gaussian Source to the pipeline,
   - Apply
   - Then go to the information panel of the object inspector : No data
arrays !!

Then, a hack is to plug a Image Magnitude to the Gaussian Source.
   - Apply
   - Set a Slice representation.
   - Slice : you see a beautiful gaussian sphere centering on the center of
the volume

Now,
    - change the Gaussian Source's Std Dev parameter (without changing
representation)
    - Apply
    - Go to the representation panel of image magnitude, and try to slice...
    - You cannot ! You have to change the slice direction
    - Moreover, go to the information panel of Image Magnitude : Z dimension
has change to 1.
    - Moreover of the moreover, Gaussian Source has z dimension to 1 too !

So, Choosing "Slice representation" in the pipeline leads to changing data
information upstream. Note that this does not occur if you change gaussian
parameter while Volume, or Outline, or any other representation is active,
except Slice.
I have this problem for many other VTK filter (like vtkImageMathematic, I
told that in an other thread).

Today, I am working on a Fedora 9, Paraview CVS system. I don't think my
Windows VS9 express has this problem.
'Hope I am guilty and that you will find my mistake...

Jerome

For sanity check, what do these return?

scalars->GetValue(i*3+1)
scalars->GetValue(i*3+2)

scalars->GetTuple(i)[1]

Would it be too painful to compile paraview with debug and to get a
full stack trace? We may also ask you to attach to paraview with a
debugger depending on what the stack looks like.

Hi David,

Are you running one of our binaries or did you compile ParaView
yourself? If you compiled it yourself, which version of Qt did you
use. On which platform?

And the version is:

QMake version 2.01a

David,

I think this is an issue with Qt 4.5. I noticed the same with Qt 4.4
but Qt 4.3 works fine. We will track this down after the 3.6 release,
when we switch to 4.5.

Message-ID: <c19fcadc0904181415r40efd888r18505658d61981c8@mail.gmail.com>

I am trying to make the camera fly around a very large data set. I turned
representation to outline, hoping that would let me setup the animation and
view it quickly (ie without having to wait 10 seconds for it to display each
frame). The idea being that once it looks like it is correctly orbiting the
outline, I could turn back on the points or surface and then do the waiting
while it rendered the actual animation. It seems like animating this little
cube shouldn't be that big of a deal, but is it doing something with the
underlying geometry even when it is in outline mode? Is there a better way
to setup the animation quickly?

Thanks,

David

I estimate June for 3.6. I don't have an estimate for 3.8 but probably
6-8 months after 3.6.

I think that the outline should render very quickly and is probably the best
way of setting the animation. Is it not doing that? It may be a bug then.

Can anyone else confirm or deny this? It goes slightly faster than if I
don't have it on outline, but certainly not like what I would expect. If you
make a camera animation with a sphere source, for example, it is real time
(you click "next frame" and it shows the next frame instantaneously). In
outline mode I would expect the same, but it takes many seconds.

Here is a large data set if you dont have one :) (

I can confirm this behavior. Funky. We'll debug this soon (before the
3.6 release).

Hi!
Thanks, retrieving works now, but the next problem is inserting:
I tried the following:

result -> InsertTuple3(i,tuple[0],tuple[1],tuple[2]);

or 

result -> InsertNextTuple(tuple);

but none of those methods work correctly. I checked the values of tuple, they are correct, but in the output - dataset, the values are wrong.. 

thx, 
Natalie

Hi!
I?m just wondering if Paraview can write time-series of files, I.e. I have as input various files grouped as a timeseries, apply a filter and then write all new files with just one command.. 

thanks,
Natalie Happenhofer

This behavior can be traced back to the fact that the vtkDataArray
allocated in VTK/Filtering/vtkImageData.cxx does not name the array.
ParaView needs all data fields to be named. Adding this single line of
code makes wit work.


scalars->SetName("scalars");


For the rest of your comments concerning slicing and information, I
cannot reproduce any of the symptoms you mentioned. Slice representation
works fine and the Extents are not touched AFAIK.

Hi Jean,

- I was aware of the missing scalars->SetName("blabla") instruction. I think
I have to post it on the VTK mailing list: I find it terrible to have to
derived a VTK class like vtkImageGaussianSource to a
vtkPVImageGaussianSource, to give a CMakeList with cxx code, for the only
purpose to overload one function and to add one line. I do that by now!!
I proposed the ImageMagnitude hack in order to produce only an XML that will
expose the VTK classes without compilation.

Question to developers would be: Has ParaView to be less restrictived about
existenz of Point/Cell Data name, or has VTK to be more strict about setting
a name, in all cases, to data?

- Today I am working on a Windows XP computer. And yes, you are right, I
cannot reproduce the bug. My Fedora looks problematic then. I will wait
until may, for Fedora 11. New system, new libs, maybe new behaviours?

Many thanks for your time!

Jerome

Natalie,

Those methods definitely work otherwise our dashboards would be
showing it. You must be doing something wrong. Make sure that tuple[]
is a double array.

Subject: [Paraview] Tiled display with multi-gpu.
Message-ID: <49EC65A7.3010105@darshan3d.com>

Hi,

Is it possible to achieve tiled display using a single dual-gpu machine 
which can drive 4 displays? I have read that the number of servers 
should atleast be equal to number of tiles.
Can paraview be configued to have atleast a 2x1 tiled display with 2 GPUs?

Thanks
Omkaranathan

IMHO, VTK has to be more strict to ensure that all data arrays are
named, maybe even assign some default unique names to the data arrays.
Some API on vtkAlgorithm breaks if arrays are not named.

Yes, just run pvserver as follows:

mpirun -np 2 pvserver -tdx=2

Of course, you'll have to build your own MPI enabled ParaView (you
cannot use the binaries provided by on www.paraview.org). You'll have
to ensure that the environment is set up correctly so that each
pvserver processes gets the right display etc.

Thanks for pointing this out. I've just changed VTK to only use its
local FindBoost.cmake if you are using CMake 2.4. Otherwise it will
use the FindBoost located in CMake 2.6.

Hi Utkarsh,

Thanks for the response.
The suggested command line creates two seperate processes and devides 
the data properly, but I'm getting both the tiles in the same 
display(connected to first GPU).

That's basically what Utkarsh meant by needing to set up the environment correctly.  Typically the GPU used is determined by the DISPLAY environment variable.  ":0" is typically the first GPU and ":1" is typically the second GPU.  You need to launch pvserver such that node 0 gets :0 for the DISPLAY env variable (or -display flag) and node 1 gets :1.

Thanks Ken,
But what I was searching for was the configuration options, as I 
couldn't find any information on how to launch the server in case of 
multiple displays.
Can I specify display numbers in machinefiles?
It would be great if I can get any pointers.

Other than the -tdx and -tdy options and the mullion options, there are no more specific pvserver configuration options.  pvserver assigns processes to tiles in a left-to-right and top-to-bottom order.  It is up to you to make sure that each process has the right X display.

Basically, you need to tell mpi to launch the different processes with different arguments.  The means of doing this is specific to the implementation of MPI.  I use the : argument for openmpi line this:

mpirun -np 1 pvserver -display :0 -tdx=2 -tdy=1 : -np 1 pvserver -display :1 -tdx=2 -tdy=1

I don't know if this works with mpich or not.

Hi,
I Think I did what you are asking  some time ago and used a pvx file  
which I handed the pvserver  as a command line option,
I can't recall all the details but here is one of the files, it was  
used when launching 2 pvservers via mpi on the same machine with 2  
graphics cards.   :

$cat myconfig.pvx
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<pvx>
   <Process Type="client">
   </Process>
   <Process Type="server">
     <Machine Name="hostname1"
              Environment="DISPLAY=:1"/>
     <Machine Name="hostname1"
              Environment="DISPLAY=:0"/>
   </Process>
</pvx>

I just found there is some more regarding the pvx file at:
http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/ParaView:FAQ

Thanks Ken :-) ,
That worked like a charm ;-) . I wasn't aware of the '*:*' argument.
Thanks for ur time.

Thanks for your response John,
As I'm using openmpi, I could get it done with the ':' argument as 
suggested by Ken, thanks for your pointer anyways.

I recompiled with debug and the seg fault went away.  I then
recompiled it with the standard build and the seg fault was still
gone.  At this point I'm fairly confused as to what caused the
original seg fault but I'm willing to chalk it up to the mysterious
force that works to extend a grad student's time in school to
unreasonable levels.

thanks,
Peter.

The same force sometimes applies to those who have been on the job for
13 years..

I recompiled with debug and the seg fault went away.  I then recompiled it with the standard build and the seg fault was still gone.  At this point I'm fairly confused as to what caused the original seg fault but I'm willing to chalk it up to the mysterious force that works to extend a grad student's time in school to unreasonable levels.

thanks,
Peter.

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview 3.4.0 and HDF5
Message-ID: <49ED4D22.8000803@gmail.com>

Hi,

    I downloaded the precompiled version of Paraview 3.4 recently from

       http://www.paraview.org/files/v3.4/paraview-3.4.0-Linux64-x86.tar.gz

    Doing a bit of google search, it seems that HDF5 has been supported 
since paraview 3.3

    When I tried to open HDF5, the drop downlist does not have HDF5 as a 
known file type?

    I can see libvtkhdf5.so in the lib directory so I am not sure what 
the problem is. I have added that path to LD_LIBRARY_PATH too.

Regards

The HDF5 library is in there because of the Xdmf library that is also  
used. I don't think there are direct HDF5 readers for paraview. You  
can format your HDF5 data into Xdmf files and you may have better luck  
or you can write a custom reader for your data.

Hi,

This is an up of this old thread. I have problems with vtkImageResample. I
wrote an XML that exposes this filter to ParaView, and
vtkImageGaussianSource and vtkImageMagnitude too. Please, could you try that
and tell me if you can reproduce this behaviour ?
- Load plugin as XML
- Create a Gaussian Source and Apply with default settings
- Plug an Image Resample proxy to the Gaussian Source output
- Set Spacing to 0.5 0.5 0.5
- Apply.

Then, a normal behaviour would be for ImageResample to produce a volume with
Extent twice more than input, so dimension (256, 256, 256). This is not the
case. Extent is blocked to 0 127 0 127 0 127. With the given spacing, the
bounding box is smaller than the input! You can try with a down-sampling of
the input: set Spacing to 2 2 2 in Image Resample object property panel,
Apply. Extent is twice less than input, Spacing twice more: bounding box is
the same, this behaviour is correct.

It acts like there is a saturation of the output extent according to the
input one. I didn't note that problem within a python script (outside
ParaView) and with an VTK-only dependent executable.

Find attached the XML.

Thanks for your time!

Hi Jerome,

I have had the same problem. It seems to be an incompatibility with the 
paraview pipeline.


Standard applications with these filters work fine.

It also affects the vtkImageConstantPad filter.


I sent my attempts to the list in March:

Subject: [Paraview] Field variable interpolation on different meshes
Message-ID: <CDF938CF8BA33546B9C6D29B9854EAF447C85DE6@EXMBXVS4B.campus.mcgill.ca>

Hi,

In the spirit of estimating the error of a numerical scheme (using Richardson's extrapolation), I computed a cell-centered solution on two different 2D meshes of size h1 and h2, where h2 > h1. Now my question is: how can I interpolate the solution (say density) A1(h1) on the finer mesh h2 so to obtain A1(h2)? Then how would I subtract both fields likewise: A2(h2) - A1(h2)?

Thanks!

Hugo.

I would like ParaView to have a bounding box representation and make the
outline actually be the outline of the model.  Some of my users find the
current behaviour confusing as we usually deal either structured of
unstructured grids and, depending on what type of data is loaded, it will
either display an outline or bounding box.  An outline could easily be
created for unstructured grids using the filter "Extract Surface" and then
"Feature edges".  What do other people think about this suggestion?

Message-ID: <d5c9d2de0904210320p342dd5adkdcc963b88e77794a@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Paraview,

When I select the 2D Glyph Circle option in Paraview 3.4.0, the glyphs look
more like an octagon than a circle. I could not find an option to increase
the number of sides or resolution so that it looks like circle. How can I do
that,  like for instance, in sphere glyph there is an option to change theta
resolution in the properties tab.

Thanks

Hi,

Having a "feature edges" representation would indeed make sense, but it 
would not replace the bounding box representation which is a very 
lightweight representation (in particular, it does not need the 
geometryFilter, which is a costly algorithm) and is needed for large 
models.

St?phane

You cannot change it, unless you modify the source code. It is
hard-coded to generate 8 points.

Look in ./VTK/Graphics/vtkGlyphSource2D.cxx

vtkGlyphSource2D::CreateCircle()

HDF5 is supported through the Xdmf format. You can understand Xdmf format as
a kind of format descriptor for HDF5 files. In HDF5 format you can store
data in several different ways, in this sense, Xdmf is just a XML file
pointing to where the data actually is inside HDF5 file (or files).
Moreover, the fastest way to get your HDF5 files loaded by ParaView is
simply writing a couple of Xdmf ASCII lines. You don't need to download,
compile and install any library. For a first try, I'd suggest you simply
writing the file manually using a text editor.

Take a look in some examples provided by Kitware and I'm sure you'll easily
understand what I'm talking about.


Regards

Renato.

Are your grids nested?  By this I mean is there a node in h1 for every node
in h2?  That should make things a bit more straightforward.

A simple way then, at least for the linear nodal shape functions usually
used in ParaView, would be just to use a vtkPointLocator for nodes/points in
h1 if the grids are nested or a vtkCellLocator which will give you the cell
and the parametric location in the cell in h1.  The points you are looking
for are the point locations of the nodes in h2 and the result of the grid
search can be used to get the field value according to h1 at that point.

As for subtracting one field from another it is straightforward once you
have both fields defined over the same grid.  You should consider the type
of norm to use for the subtraction (e.g. L2 norm seems like a decent
choice).  For more accurate results though you may want to actually do the
subtraction over the integration points of the cells and this is where
nested grids make things much easier.

Message-ID: <c9010c7d0904211141h3961a47fi8ce807375b071753@mail.gmail.com>

Is there any reason that someone may want to use vtkPVMain with ParaView
compiled with MPI that doesn't want it to be initialize MPI if MPI is not
already initialized?

Right now the InitializeMPI variable is used to both indicate whether or not
to initialize and finalize MPI as well as to indicate whether or not to use
MPI.  This is a bit confusing for programs that want to use vtkPVMain but
want to initialize and finalize MPI elsewhere.

Thanks,
Andy

Yes, there's a reason. The pvpython executable and paraview executable
don't want MPI initialized even if ParaView is compiled with MPI since
these processes shouldn't be run with MPI enabled. You are right,
right now vtkPVMain::InitializeMPI does indeed mean initialize and use
mpi. Maybe adding a new flag UseMPI and changing the meaning of
InitializeMPI to initialize the MPI only if UseMPI is true makes more
sense.

 If I want to change, I will have to download the source and modify it and

Nope, sorry, the circle radius is hard coded, so you will have to recompile.

Alternatively, you could try creating the circle you want some other way (for example sphere -> slice), then use the Glyph (Custom Source) filter (instead of the standard Glyph filter) to use the circle you created.

You cannot change it, unless you modify the source code. It is
hard-coded to generate 8 points.

Look in ./VTK/Graphics/vtkGlyphSource2D.cxx

vtkGlyphSource2D::CreateCircle()

I am now using the binary version of paraview 3.4.
 If I want to change, I will have to download the source and modify it and compile.. right? No other way?

Thanks

Subject: [Paraview] problems with volume rendering
Message-ID: <BAY122-W471DF8A1D14A5A0214C0EABC740@phx.gbl>


Hi!
I?m trying to render the volume of a vector valued dataset. That?s what I tried (and what happens):

1) I read in a scalar valued dataset and applied the gradient filter. Viewing the output as a "surface" works well and the data look ok, but clicking on "Volume", Paraview get a segmentation fault.

2) I read in a scalar valued dataset and applied the gradient filter. Then I saved the data and opened it again with paraview. It seems, that the output of the gradient filter is a dataset with two associated arrays to it, the first scalar-valued and being the values of which the gradient was computed, and the second data-array consists of vectors, which are the computed gradients. 
Clicking now on "volume", I get a rather strange picture, it seems that in the first third of the dataset the scalars are displayed and then there are many little points on the rest of the cube.. if anyone wants I can mail a screenshot. 

3) I opened a dataset with just a vector-valued array associated. Again, "Surface" is ok, but clicking on "volume", I get the error: "Cannot volume render since no point (or cell) data is available". (Well, the vector-array should be a point data array). 

Maybe it is not possible to render the volume of a vector -valued dataset?

thanks for any piece of advice,
Natalie

Message-ID: <e7f43c4f0904220254i46972ff4s34b1d5d0609c0645@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I gave up to find a solution for Windows plug-in deployment. I don't have
access to a VS2005 licence here, so I build ParaView together with my
plugins and share all this at the same time. My hopes was that I have to
only share the DLL of my plugin, and users install Official Release
Binaries, and that's all.

Now, I wonder if the next on-line available binaries will be built from the
same Windows environment, or if a VS2008 Express built is planned. IMHO, it
will increase the well-done Core/Plugin architecture of ParaView.

Best regards,
Jerome

I've a problem with threshold on paraview 3.2.3 on kubuntu 9.04 (kde 4.2.2, qt 4.5.0). I receive

and I can't insert values into the upper and lower threshold of the threshold filter. I've to install 
qt 4.3.0? Or the problem is anything else?

We will not use VS2008 express, I am afraid. We want to be consistent
in our use of compilers and VS2008 express does not support 64 bit.
However, we are going to add support for 3rd party plugins - we will
setup a way of building these plugins with our binaries and distribute
them separately as 3rd party plugins. Of course, we will need the
source code for those plugins to do that. I am not sure that this will
be available by 3.6 but definitely by 3.8.

Thank you !
Sorry for the foolish question, I was not aware of the 32-bit-exclusivity of
VS2008 express. Currently, I am working on XP-32 and Fedora-64.
So I will wait PV3.8.

Thankyou again,
Jerome

Sounds like a bug that needs fixing. Please post a bug on the bug

A screenshot would be helpful.

I'm not sure if there are any volume rendering algorithms in VTK that
operate directly on vectors. What do you want the transfer function to
do with the vector exactly? The obvious choice is to compute the
vector magnitude and then volume render that, which you can by
filtering and then volume rendering the output of the magnitude
filter.

Subject: [Paraview] Un-Rescale Data To Range
Message-ID: <c19fcadc0904220705s36ab63e6va167f17459932b98@mail.gmail.com>

I made a color map like this (-1 is black, 0 is green, 1 is red)

<ColorMap name="Consistency" space="RGB">

<Point x="-1.000" o="1" r="0.0" g="0.0" b="0.0"/>
<Point x="0.000" o="1" r="0.0" g="1.0" b="0.0"/>
<Point x="1.000" o="1" r="1.0" g="0.0" b="0.0"/>

</ColorMap>

When I apply the colormap, it automatically rescales the map to fit the
range of the data. Would it make more sense to leave the colormap alone
until the user clicks "Rescale to Data Range"? Then also, when I go into
"Edit color map" and uncheck "Automatically Rescale to Fit Data Range", it
would be nice if it snapped back to the original color map values, without
having to then click "Rescale range" and enter the values manually. Here is
not a huge problem, but if the color map was automatically generated by my
code, I may not know even know the range that it was supposed to be, so I
could not enter the values manually.

Thoughts?

Thanks,

David

Message-ID: <e7f43c4f0904220858m4cee9ba8n221d5324685ed2d6@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I want to mimic the Line Source of Paraview. So I ran into the XML in order
to understand how the 3D widget is created, the one that makes available a
picker through the 'P' key. Unfortunately, I didn't understand...

1- In sources.xml, I found a "LineSource" proxy description in the sources
ProxyGroup, with label "Line" that match with the one available under the
sources menu of Paraview.
2- In utilities.xml, I found another "LineSource" proxy, but with label
"Line Source" in the extended_sources ProxyGroup.

The XML looks very usual, with DoubleVectorProperty for each point and an
IntVectorProperty for the output line resolution, except the PropertyGroup.
I didn't find in the paraview book the explanation of this <Hint>

My questions are:
- What is the difference?
- What are the keyword in these XML descriptions that activate the 3D
widget?
- Is the PropertyGroup involved in the interaction mecanism?

Thank you all,

Jerome

* The LineSource in  "extended_sources" is a high-resolution line
source, used for filters such as StreamTracer. It's same as the
LineSource in "extended_sources" except for the default value for the
"Resolution".

* The PropertyGroup specified in the <Hints /> section is what tells
the GUI to create the interaction widget for this source to control
certain properties. There are a predefined set of values that can be
used for type which identifies each  type of widget provided by
ParaView such as LineSource/ImplicitPlane etc. Each type comes with a
predefined set of functions such as
"Point1WorldPosition"/'Point2WorldPosition" which are basically
properties on the widget. Now the <Property /> elements in the
PropertyGroup tell the GUI how these widget properties are to be
mapped to the filter/source properties. In case of the LineSource, we
are mapping the "Point1" property on the LineSource to the
"Point1WorldPosition" on the widget and so on.

Is it possible to sort by a particular column in spreadsheet view?

Nope.  It has been reported as bug number 8282, and is slated for ParaView 3.8.

You can always write the data to a CSV file, then import it into excel, then sort.  Clunky I know.

Look at the LineSource proxy in source.xml.  In particular, look at the LineSource PropertyGroup in the Hints.

Dear all,

I want to mimic the Line Source of Paraview. So I ran into the XML in order to understand how the 3D widget is created, the one that makes available a picker through the 'P' key. Unfortunately, I didn't understand...

1- In sources.xml, I found a "LineSource" proxy description in the sources ProxyGroup, with label "Line" that match with the one available under the sources menu of Paraview.
2- In utilities.xml, I found another "LineSource" proxy, but with label "Line Source" in the extended_sources ProxyGroup.

The XML looks very usual, with DoubleVectorProperty for each point and an IntVectorProperty for the output line resolution, except the PropertyGroup. I didn't find in the paraview book the explanation of this <Hint>

My questions are:
- What is the difference?
- What are the keyword in these XML descriptions that activate the 3D widget?
- Is the PropertyGroup involved in the interaction mecanism?

Thank you all,

Message-ID: <c19fcadc0904221336j23e95b38x2fefcd6723865830@mail.gmail.com>

I have a vtk file which was made from an image stack. The slice slider is
excellent, but I'd like to save an animation of the slices moving.
When I select MyFile.vtk in Animation View, there is only Visibility and
Opacity as choices for what to animate. Is there a way to animate the slice
slider?

Thanks,

When I go to "File -> Save Data", the last directory that I was in is
displayed in the "Look in" field. The "Files of type:" is set to ".vtp"
(which is the type of the file I am working with). However, no files appear
under "Filename"! If I change "Files of type" to something else, and then
back to .vtp, the files appear. Is this another qt problem that will just go
away with the next release (since the newer qt will be used)? Or is it a
paraview bug?

That's a known bug. I should be fix before the next release.

Hi!
I got it to work with saving every component of the input array in a separate vtkDoubleArray. 

input1 -> GetPointData() -> GetArray(arr1) -> GetData(0,numOfTuples1,0,0, scalars1comp0);
input1 -> GetPointData() -> GetArray(arr1) -> GetData(0,numOfTuples1,1,1, scalars1comp1);
input1 -> GetPointData() -> GetArray(arr1) -> GetData(0,numOfTuples1,2,2, scalars1comp2);

input2 -> GetPointData() -> GetArray(arr2) -> GetData(0,numOfTuples2,0,0, scalars2comp0);
input2 -> GetPointData() -> GetArray(arr2) -> GetData(0,numOfTuples2,1,1, scalars2comp1);
input2 -> GetPointData() -> GetArray(arr2) -> GetData(0,numOfTuples2,2,2, scalars2comp2);

Then I?m working with those arrays. 

greetings,
Natalie

Another option that is accessible in the GUI is to use the extract subset filter to extract a slice using the volume of interest (VOI) parameters, and then animate those parameters.

Kevin,

Any help is always appreciated :). However given that we are gearing
towards the ParaView 3.6 release, for which the official Qt version
will remain Qt 4.3.*, any non-backwards compatible changes will have
to wait until after the branch.

Both of my boxes (murron and gargon) just upgraded to qt-4.5 with Fedora-10.

This is causing configuration errors on the VTK and ParaView dashboards.

Should I build a supported version of qt?

Should I leave the configuration as it is and help as much as I can in 
supporting the new version?

You're absolutely right. The errors are only on the ParaView Dashboard.

Apparently I can't baby-wrangle and line up the dashboard columns at the 
same time.

The outline render is very quickly, but if you change a filter  
parameter during the animation
paraview will still calculate the solution.

Hm, I wasn't changing any filter params, just trying to move the camera.

I am running QT 4.5 on Windows , both ParaView and VTK compile Ok. The
only thing I had to do was to delete the build directory and re-run
CMake.

This is definitely a bug/issue. David is not doing anything wrong. We
will investigate it.

Hello all,
        
        I'm struggling with camera positions in an animation I try to
        make. What
        I want is :
        
        1 move and zoom the camera to a given spot.
        2 Wait for a while 
        3 move to another spot
        
        Is this posible and if yes ... how do I do that ?
        
        Thanks a lot,
        
        Jouke

My ctest scripts have

# should ctest wipe the binary tree before running
SET (CTEST_START_WITH_EMPTY_BINARY_DIRECTORY TRUE)

So the build should be starting with empty build directories.

I updated my cvs a few weeks back and since then I have not been able

John:

You might verify the following:

* That VTK/Utilities/utf8/source/utf8.h exists in your source tree.

* That VTK/vtkIncludeDirectories.cmake line 194 looks like

	# Include UTF-8 support
	SET(VTK_INCLUDE_DIRS_SOURCE_TREE ${VTK_INCLUDE_DIRS_SOURCE_TREE}
   		${VTK_SOURCE_DIR}/Utilities/utf8/source)

My suspicion is that one or both are missing, in which case your source 
tree somehow isn't completely synced with CVS.

Cheers,
Tim

In order to get CTest to configure ParaView with the Qt on Fedora 10 I
made some changes to the top level CMakeLists.txt.

I tried to repeat the warning for Qt-4.4 nested in with the error I was
getting for Qt-4.5.

I'm running an experimental build on gargon now.

Thank you. Very much!

I had no VTK/Utilities/utf8 folder at all.

I just updated and it grabbed that folder.

I will try to figure out why cvs did not sync everything.

You probably just forgot the "-d" option to cvs update. Without that
it will not create new directories in your working directory.

You have to use "-d" with your cvs updates to get new directories....
I always use:
cvs up -dAP

to sync my dev trees to CVS HEAD.

Subject: [Paraview] Error when opening openFOAM case
Message-ID: <e6d1c8ca0904240831x229b8057t1a9de6d5137e6004@mail.gmail.com>

Hello ParaView gurus,

I've been having trouble for weeks getting ParaView to work. I've
finally gotten a build that loads and seems to work well until I try
to load an openFOAM casefile. In ParaView, I open the file
(casename.foam) and then it asks for a reader because the program
doesn't know how to read the file and then it crashes with this
message in the terminal.

/Volumes/openFOAM/ThirdParty/ParaView3.5 ->
bin/paraview.app/Contents/MacOS/paraview
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::length_error'
  what():  basic_string::_S_create
Abort trap

The source was obtained from the cvs repository last night and it was
built with MPI turned off. I'm on an Intel Mac running OS X 10.5
trying to use ParaView to visualize openFOAM results.

Any help would be very appreciated, I really want to get this working
on my Mac (instead of giving in and using Linux...)

Thanks!
Bill

Thanks, all. That was it. I forgot that because I mostly use cvs
through a GUI and this time I did just a

cvs up

from a command window.

I have been doing a lot of

git pull

from linux lately so I forgot the cvs options are needed to get new folders..

I can confirm identical symptoms with CVS from earlier this week,
compiled with gcc-4.3.3 on

Linux brakk 2.6.29-ARCH #1 SMP PREEMPT Sun Mar 29 19:31:38 CEST 2009 x86_64 Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Duo CPU T9300 @ 2.50GHz GenuineIntel GNU/Linux

This error is quite familiar (even on Linux). You have a few possible
courses of action:

- use foamToEnsight* to convert to EnSight formats

- use the library plugin supplied with OpenFOAM (loads files with
".OpenFOAM" extension)

- use Takuya OSHIMA's updated version of the OpenFOAM reader. Actually,
can someone explain why this isn't included in VTK by default? It seems
to work fairly well and Takuya is quite diligent about providing fixes
and improvements.

Here's some further information:

Message-ID: <c19fcadc0904241004m5aab6ea4g1e8c1e9b48a7f7a9@mail.gmail.com>

I want to open some .ply files and save them as .vtp files in a python
script.

For reading vtp's, I've used
reader = servermanager.sources.XMLPolyDataReader(FileName=ModelFilename)

I saw there was a vtkPly class, so I tried
    reader = servermanager.sources.PlyFile(FileName=ModelFilename)
and it says "no attribute PlyFile"

For writing a vtp, I thought it may be something like
rep.XMLPolyDataWriter(NewFilename)
or
servermanager.sources.XMLPolyDataWriter(NewFilename)

but both give errors.

Anyone know how to do this?

Also, I'm curious why Paraview does not have the ability to import .obj
files? That seems to be what many algorithms take as input and give as
output, so I find myself using Blender to convert obj to ply, then Paraview
to convert ply to vtp. Does anyone else think it would be nice to support
.obj's?

Thanks,

David

Hey David,

Only responding to one little piece, it's:

servermanager.writers.XMLPolyDataWriter()

to take the guess work out, you may simply refer to the help using the
dir() command

dir(servermanager.sources)??? # will print out all sources, and you will
find what you are looking for under the name

servermanager.sources.PLYreader()

reader = servermanager.sources.plyreader(FileName=ModelFilename)

Here is how to write once you have the file read:
    writer = servermanager.writers.XMLPolyDataWriter(FileName="test.vtp")
    writer.Input = reader
    writer.UpdatePipeline()

I added an example of how to take a screenshot and how to convert a file to
the wiki.

The only remaining question is why is there no obj support?

Thanks,

David

There is the vtkOBJReader.  It's not in paraview, but you can access
it from the vtk.io module bundled with paraview.

import paraview.vtk.io as vtkio

# for pv 3.4, use instead: import vtkIOPython as vtkio
#     or on posix, import libvtkIOPython as vtkio

r = vtkio.vtkOBJReader()
w = vtkio.vtkXMLPolyDataWriter()
r.SetFileName("/home/pat/porsche.obj")
w.SetFileName("/home/pat/porsche.vtp")
w.SetInput(r.GetOutput())
w.Write()


The above code is purely in the vtk world, so you can't mix it with
things from servermanager, and you can't do things like
Reader(FileName=foo)

Thanks for the reading obj example, Pat. I looked at dir(vtkio) after
importing it, and it looks like there is an ObjReader, but not an ObjWriter
(makes sense, because I've been wondering the same thing about the missing
objwriter in c++ vtk). How do people generally write obj files from
polydata's?

Thanks,

David

Hi Mark,

Thanks for the mention about the reader. In fact, it was once checked
into the CVS late last year, but reverted back to the original version
due to too many dashboard errors especially on older and minor
platforms (VS6/SunOS/HP-UX/AIX).

Perhaps I can make a one-time effort of getting rid of all the
reported errors provided that the VTK developers are collaborative
(except an ICE generated by only one of the VS6 dashboard machines for
which I totally have no idea about a solution unless I have direct
access to that particular machine). But I don't think I am so diligent
and patient as to keep asking the VTK developers for repetitive
dashboard trials and errors each time I make improvements or bugfixes
in order to maintain the reader ongoing.

However as a bright side, I am aware of the recent "Can we drop Visual
Studio 6 support?" discussion held on the vtk-developers list. During
the discussion there were not only VS6 but also some other outdated
platforms named as retiring candidates. If it materializes, the
contribution could be easier since most of the remaining (similar)
platforms listed on the dashboard are accessible around me and thus I
should be able to prepare on my part.

Regards,
Takuya

Hi David,

Good question.  I've worked with obj files before, but never in vtk.
After a quick read of vtkOBJExporter, I think I can answer your
question.  I encourage you to take a look at the source code for
vtkOBJExporter.cxx, it's actually quite readable.  Here is what it
does:


The exporter takes a renderer, gets the actors from the renderer, and
loops for each actor.  For each actor, it calls
vtkOBJExporter::WriteAnActor.  This method gets the material
properties from the actor and writes them to the .mtl file.  Then it
gets the actor's dataset.  If the dataset is not polydata, it converts
it to polydata by pushing it through the vtkGeometryFilter.  Then it
writes the polydata's geometry to the .obj file.


If you have some time and you want to improve this file, it might be
helpful if you pulled some of the code from
vtkOBJExporter::WriteAnActor and put it into a new subroutine named
something like vtkOBJExporter::WriteAPolyData.  Then you could use
this method to write a .obj file from a polydata if you are not
interested in having an accompanying.mtl file.

Pat, I did exactly what you said and now have a function:
void WriteAPolyData(vtkSmartPointer<vtkPolyData> pd, std::string
&OutputFilename)
that seems to work!

At first I tried to put it in the public section of vtkOBJExporter.h/.cxx
and recompile Paraview/VTK, but it tells me there is a compiler parsing
error (there is nothing wrong with the syntax because it compiles fine
"outside" of VTK).

In vtkOBJExporter.h, I added
#include "vtkSmartPointer.h"
#include "vtkPolyData.h"
#include <string>

And under:
  void PrintSelf(ostream& os, vtkIndent indent);
I added:
void WriteAPolyData(vtkSmartPointer<vtkPolyData> pd, std::string
&OutputFilename);

I put the function definition in vtkOBJExporter.cxx.

After fighting that for a while (with no resolution) I moved the declaration
outside the class (to the very bottom of vtkOBJExporter.h (as the function
doesn't actually rely on anything in the class anyway) and it compiled fine.
Can I commit this function? I feel like it would probably be useful for many
users. (I don't have write access).

As a side note : I have QT4.5 and cmake (with the latest cvs paraview/vtk)
wouldn't let me proceed installing vtk because the qt version was too high.
I commented out that check in the CMakeLists.txt file and it seemed to work
just fine... is there a reason that check is still there? Maybe it should be
decreased to a warning instead of a show-stopping error?

Thanks,

Dave

Hi Dave,

Usually we try to minimize the number of extra includes placed into a
header.  Is it possible to rewrite the method declaration as:

void WriteAPolyData(vtkPolyData* pd, const char *OutputFilename);

and then replace the 3 added includes with the line:

class vtkPolyData;

About your compile error, you didn't include the specific error
message so I can only guess, but I think it is a parse error from the
python wrapper.  The python wrapper doesn't recognize template
arguments like vtkSmartPointer or std::strings.  If a method uses such
types then its declaration must be preceded with a line containing
//BTX and followed by //ETX, this tells the parser to skip over the
declaration.  It also means this method will not be available from
python.

Another suggestion, in vtk it is preferred to use vtkstd::string or
vtkStdString instead of std::string.

Hi Pat,
In this case none of the string functionality is used anyway, so char* would
be fine - std::string just always seems like the "new" way to do things to
me, and with almost no overhead (maybe I'm wrong?). Also, why would you not
want to use a smart pointer around the polydata (and I had also used smart
pointers around all of the other variables (normals, points, etc) in the
function)? I thought that was the "vtk way" to do things? Maybe it is only
to keep the python support like you mentioned?

I understand the forward declaration of the class that already has some of
the other headers that I had included - wouldn't it be more clear to
explicitly show which headers are used though? I have never worked on a big
project like this so maybe there are significant costs of re-including the
headers that I'm not used to caring about?

Also - I didn't mention that I changed the printf's to use std::ofstream - I
suppose that's out of the question too?

You were exactly right about the parser error - it compiled fine with the
//BTX //ETX tags.

(Maybe we should move this to a dev list instead of the users list? Or take
the discussion offline?)

Thanks,

David

Message-ID: <6c915be80904260137o3654c6a3g7ec5955631531db5@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all, I have a field u(x,y,t), stored in a set of .vtk files (one for each
time steps). What I need to do is the following,

1) At each time steps, cut a slice, say through y=0, so as to have a set of
curves
    u(x,0,t1)
    u(x,0,t2)
    u(x,0,t3) ...

2) build a contour plot of the surface formed by stacking the above lines on
top of each other

Is there a filter for that or do I have to write a python script? If I have
to use python, can you give me an idea of how to do that?

Thanks

Daniele

Hi everyne:
  I want to add the plugin through building code as part of paraview. My plugin is a object pannel and I can add it through loading *.dll by the plugin manager. I followed the request of "Build Code As Part Of ParaView" from the ParaView's net. I got the success when I configured the CMake,But there are 22 false when I compile the code by vs2005.
  2DGLYPHParaViewImport.cmake:
  SET (2DGLYPH_SRCS
    ${2DGLYPH_SOURCE_DIR}/pq2DGlyph.cxx
     )
  INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES(${2DGLYPH_SOURCE_DIR})
  INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES(${2DGLYPH_SOURCE_DIR}/..)
  PARAVIEW_INCLUDE_WRAPPED_SOURCES("${2DGLYPH_SRCS}")
 Can anyone tell me how to solve this problem. Thanks very much.

Hi,
I use visual microsoft visual c++ to run my c++ code. I write my results as VTK imagedata, PointDataScalars, float 32, ascii format.
I know I could use binary instead of ascii format to substantially reduce the size of my results.
Is it possible to link directly my c++ code to a paraview library to directly write my results in binary (zipped) format without installing cmake?
thanks for your help,

Thanks, all. That was it. I forgot that because I mostly use cvs
through a GUI and this time I did just a

cvs up

from a command window.

I have been doing a lot of

git pull

from linux lately so I forgot the cvs options are needed to get new folders..

Subject: [Paraview] Plugin Wizard for Paraview development
Message-ID: <49F764AF.2000305@gmail.com>

I would like to share with the rest of the Paraview development 
community a small program that MIRARCO developed as an internal (and 
open source) tool.

The program is called PluginWizard. It was designed to streamline the 
development of basic plugins (Filters/Readers/Writers/Sources), by 
creating the framework (xml, cmake, cxx and h files).

http://pluginwizard.mirarco.org/

Developer contacts are available on the website, so feel free to let us 
know of any bugs you come across, or any features you would like to see 
implemented. I expect development to continue on the project as we enter 
internship season.

Thank you.

This is cool.  I bet this could help a lot of plugin beginners.  Are there any issues with adding a link to this from the ParaView Wiki?

Hello Utkarsh,

I was wondering if you have found another writer in Paraview 3.4 ?

From bogus@does.not.exist.com  Thu Apr  9 10:40:16 2009
From: bogus@does.not.exist.com ()
Date: Thu, 09 Apr 2009 14:40:16 -0000
Subject: No subject
Message-ID: <mailman.14.1241006712.3311.paraview@paraview.org>

format, as long as it is written to a file outside Paraview.
The data I need to write is the Cell Data and Point Data of integrated
values.

Once again, thanks for the help.

Regards, Bart

Gargon has been submitting builds with Qt-4.5 from Fedora 10 for several
days now. 

It has rather more test failures than the other builds.

There are several errors that look like this:

-------------- client output --------------
Couldn't find object  "pqClientMainWindow/lookmarkInspectorDock/1QDockWidgetTitleButton1" 
Found up to  "pqClientMainWindow/lookmarkInspectorDock" 
pvTestDriver: client process exited with code 1

Hi All, 

When I write my own plugin filters, I can choose to have them appear in a
menu of my choice rather than having them under Alphabetical. 
I would like to modify the .cpd files of custom filters so that some custom
filters appear in another menu than Alphabetical as well. How do I do this ?
Is this supported ?

Menu position cannot be controlled from the cpd files. You can write a
plugin that provides the custom filter you want and then add it to the
custom menu.

Message-ID: <!&!AAAAAAAAAAAYAAAAAAAAAF0V88snc7NDnLzKjZ+tgCrCgAAAEAAAAKSqCHNKJvlDsjKQnTsHBR0BAAAAAA==@ara.co.uk>


Hi all, 

I would like to be able to obtain the list of blocks available in a dataset
(by name) through Python.
At the moment, I am using the following :

blockFilter=servermanager.filters.ExtractBlock(Input = ensightReader)
blockFilter.BlockIndices = [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]
blockFilter.PruneOutput = 1


This works fine but I need to hardcode the indices.
What I would like is to enable the python script to output a list of indices
and names of blocks before .... How can I do this ?

Thank you !

What I mean by a plugin for a custom filter, is almost like a new
plugin for a filter with the servermanager xml and the gui xmls
however, instead of a new filter, the servermanager xml will inlcude
the custom filter definition. Having said that, it may a good feature
request to add support for specifying filter menu category in cpd
files. Please feel free to add a feature request to the bug tracker.

Hey again,

Thanks Utkarsh -- with your description I was able to figure out how  
to put a custom filter in some servermanager xml to load it through a  
plugin. I was also able to combine this with some GUI xml which adds a  
new menu item and puts the custom filter there, plus a custom icon for  
the menu (by using CMake and building against ParaView).

In reading through the Plugin HowTo, though, it seems to imply that  
both the icon and the GUI xml can be combined into a binary .bqrc file  
(using Qt's rcc) so that I could do all of this without having to  
build against ParaView (and just load servermanager xml and bqrc  
through the Plugin Manager).

I can load the servermanager xml and use the filter, but I can't seem  
to get the menu item and/or icon to show up when I load the bqrc file  
-- is there a special way to build the qrc and GUI xml together with  
rcc to make this work?

Thanks a lot,
-Eric

Subject: [Paraview] Exodus weirdness
Message-ID: <49F9FC4A.60201@arl.army.mil>

I am working with one of my customers viewing an Exodus dataset 
generated by Alegra(?) using 256p.    The dataset loads fine, but seems 
to have an issue at the processor boundaries.    When viewing the 
dataset using something like a clip plane or isosurface, the data seems 
to be "slipped" (or offset) at each processor boundary - that is, there 
appears to be a hard edge at each processor boundary.     Unfortunately, 
I'm not able to post an image that represents the problem.

I'm not familiar with the Exodus data format, but it looks like it could 
be an issue associate with ghost cells.   Either there are no ghost 
cells at the processor boundary layer, or they're possibly being 
mismanaged?     Curiously enough, this is the first time we've noticed 
this problem after processing quite a few Exodus datasets.    We're 
using the latest production version of Paraview (3.4) and we've also 
been able to duplicate the issue with other visualization tools, so we 
think this is a problem with this particular Exodus dataset, if not the 
Exodus format in general.

Any ideas?

Hi folks

when running pvbatch on time-dependent data and on many processors, the
output becomes very verbatim since every proc writes messages similar to

vtkCutter : [.......] x 1000000 million times

I end up with files of millions of lines which I do not read. I just
look at the movies...

Is there a flag to make pvbatch silent?

TIA
Jean

Indeed use:

I don't recall seeing anything quite like that before.  Are these boundaries in question those in the original simulation (noted by the file number) or the processes in your visualization (which can be annotated with the Process Id Scalars filter)?  Does running the data through D3 help?

Subject: [Paraview] qt 4.5 64-bit mac os x
Message-ID: <AFE633CD-751A-4FE8-B60A-3E7B3700C1AA@usace.army.mil>

Hi,

I've been trying to compile paraview in 64 bit using the qt 4.5  
binaries distributed by trolltech. It looks like the variable  
QT_MAC_USE_COCOA is not being set by cmake, but it looks like it's  
needed to compile with the new qt (need -DQT_MAC_USE_COCOA).  Does  
anybody know what's going on here?

Thanks,
Chris
