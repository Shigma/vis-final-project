Subject: [Paraview] ensight, time dependent, SEGFAULT
Message-ID: <alpine.DEB.2.00.1001032323590.18655@localhost>


  Hi

  I'm having problems opening a time dependent ensight file (set of files). 
After the first time step, if I make it advance in time, paraview 
segfaults. I'm using the latest cvs version, compiled in a debian machine. 
I've tried it in my laptop and remotely, using pvserver. I've run it 
through ens_checker and it reports everything ok. any ideas? Is something 
broken? I can make the dataset available for try out (just email me).

  best,

  Ricardo Reis

On this page: http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Paraview_Make_building_Paraview_plugin_optional
2 CMakeLists.txt files appear, is it a mistake? should one of them be a link on the other one? what else?

Having never made a paraview filter but made hundreds of
CMakeLists.txt files it looks to me this is about organizing the code.
In my projects I have a CMakeLists.txt file for every subdirectory in
the source code. You do not have to do this that way its a matter of
preference and in my opinion makes the build system more manageable.

Yep, John got it exactly. You'll notice that one of them is:
MyFilter/CMakeLists.txt

and the other:
MyFilter/plugin/CMakeLists.txt

The idea of this page was to demonstrate how to optionally build a subdirectory:

SET(BUILD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN OFF CACHE BOOL "Build Paraview plugin?")

if(BUILD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN)
 SUBDIRS(plugin)
endif(BUILD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN)

Thanks,

David

Subject: [Paraview] STEREO_CRYSTAL_EYES type
Message-ID: <201001041613.22857.joelle.caro@ec-lyon.fr>



Hi,

I build ParaView from CVS tag 3.6.2-RC1 with crystal eyes stereo type on a linux 64 workstation.


I modify the line 50 in VTK/Rendering/vtkRenderWindow.cxx 
	this->StereoType = VTK_STEREO_CRYSTAL_EYES;

But when I launch "paraview --stereo" the display in Paraview is  in red-blue mode (the default mode)


The crystal eyes stereo type works fine with 3.2.2 release.  Does somebody encounter this problem with the new release? Do I need to specify something else?

Kind regards,


Jo?lle

Hi all,

I'm working with paraview in script python, and I would like to use the
EnSightWriter. 

But when I'm running, the program crash and it appear the error message
"error pvbatch.exe"

I don't understand why the program didn't run. 

 

Thanks for your answer.

I would like that the possible values of variable TimeStep be chosen in the range of the selected scalar array, for instance thanks to a slider.

You don't need to change the line in vtkRenderWindow. Instead, change
the default value for the StereoType property on the RenderWIndow
proxy in Servers/ServerManager/Resoruces/rendering.xml to "1" as
follows:


 <IntVectorProperty name="StereoType"
        command="SetStereoType"
        number_of_elements="1"
        default_values="1">                     <-- ***** HERE's the
changed value ** -->
        <EnumerationDomain name="enum">
          <Entry value="1" text="Crystal Eyes" />
           ......
        </EnumerationDomain>
      </IntVectorProperty>

I am guessing that this is because the EnSight writer is now a bit out
of date. Does this work from the GUI at all?

There is also a short Python tutorial in The ParaView Tutorial (http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/The_ParaView_Tutorial) and there is  somewhat more complete documentation on the Python scripting on the Wiki (http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Python_Scripting).

Is there any tutorial about using Python script for  it?

Thank you



2009/12/21 Moreland, Kenneth <kmorel at sandia.gov>


Luis,

With the 3.6.2 release candidate and  the latest CVS you can use the Python tracing to build a Python script that  does the operation you wish.  You can then edit the script if necessary  and make a macro for it.

One of the intentions of the Python  tracing/macro capability is to make creating solutions to these repetitive  processes easy.  If you try this, let us know how it works for  you.

Hi David, thank you very much.
Custom filter is  useful but it doesn't seem to be exactly what we would.
In fact, with  this filter we obtain the final result.
Instead, we would preserve in  our pipeline all operation:

1) slice
2)  contours
3)...

Can anyone help us?
Thank  you

Hi all,
could you please explain the way to  automatize a sequence of operations?

For example, suppose I  always have to apply on every input:

1) slice filter (with some  plane...)
2) contour filter (on some variable, with some values  interval...)

We would like to apply automatically these two  operations after loading a generic input file.
W tried to use File  -> Save state, but this saves the sequence and the input, and we  won't the input.

Thank  you

Happy New Year Utkarsh,

> What is the user wants the panel

> MyFilter)?
To be honest I hadn't anticipated the situation but, as far as I can 
tell this scenario is OK under the proposed change because the group is 
tested first and if it doesn't match the search is terminated. So bottom 
line, panels for objects with the same name but a different group can be 
distinct and PV won't get confused.

Here is an example of how the proposed changes lets one associate the 
same panel with both a source and a filter that is implemented with a 
single vtk class. For example if the class is vtkSQHemisphereSource and 
the panel is pqSQHemisphereSource, here is what the cmake lists look like:

# beginning of cmake lists

QT4_WRAP_CPP(MOC_SRCS pqSQHemisphereSource.h)
QT4_WRAP_UI(UI_SRCS pqSQHemisphereSourceForm.ui)
ADD_PARAVIEW_OBJECT_PANEL(
  IFACES IFACE_SRCS
  CLASS_NAME pqSQHemisphereSource
  XML_NAME vtkSQHemisphereSource
  XML_GROUP sources filters)   # <----------------------THE PROPOSED 
CHANGE GIVES YOU THIS

# end of cmake lists

Here is what the server manager XML looks like:

Taking a quick look at how it all works in pqObjectInspectorWidget it 
doesn't look like there is a cleaner solution to be had easily. But you 
know you are the expert here, so if there is a better way you probably 
spot it better than I. I can say this though, this solution may not be 
elegant but in most cases the change adds very little over head because 
in the nested m*n loop, the outer m loop is the number of groups, will 
almost always be 1 and when it's not m will most likely be 2, in the 
worst case (I don't think it will ever come up) it could be 3 or 4 
(sources,filters,readers, what else?). And, n the number of custom 
panels, currently I will guess is at worst on the order of 100. So we're 
not talking about adding a lot of work here.

Let me know if you have something better in mind

Message-ID: <FCB109C3-DDCA-4FBD-9133-D6418920D9F5@videotron.ca>

Good afternoon,

using the latest cvs version, it seems that the client-server mode does not work as well as before (early december).
For some reason, every time I try to pan or rotate, the client application re-downloads all the data, which was not the case before. 
Using the standard view buttons work properly doe not generate a full re-download of the data. With this new behaviour, it's impossible 
to work under the client-server mode.

Suggestions ?

Thanks

So, if I understand correctly, you are using local-rendering mode i.e.
deliver data to client and render. How are you determining that the
client is re-downloading the data? I just tried with a simple sphere
source, and could not reproduce the behavior.

Hi !

yes, I'm connecting to a server machine which is running pvserver. The local and server machines have exactly
the same cvs version.

I tried different cases / an easy one was to open an stl file located on the server machine side. I'm monitoring the network
traffic on the client machine. As soon as I try to move/rotate the stl geometry, I can see that the download traffic is going up
and reach the maximum for some time.

Thanks

Try this:
* Open Tools | Timer Log.
* Change the "Time Threshold" to "Show All"
* Pan etc. then click "Refresh"
If there are any entires in there that say "vtkMPIMoveData" it
represents a data delivery to the client.
* I can see data-delivery happens when I change properties on the
source, but never when merely interacting with it.

Hi,

I'm bumping up this old thread now that PV 3.6.2 has been released.
Any chance the development files for 3.6.2 can be made available, too,
to ease the task of providing plugins for the official binary releases?

Thanks,
Sven

Subject: [Paraview] cannot get streamlines on unstructured meshes
In-Reply-To: <4B3AAA5E.7090004@ices.utexas.edu>
Message-ID: <C767B439.158B7%kmorel@sandia.gov>

It looks like your mesh comprises voxel elements instead of hexahedral elements.  I guess voxel elements are not really well supported in unstructured grids (you are supposed to use hexahedra instead).  How did you create this data set?  Did you start with a structured grid and convert it to an unstructured grid?

Hi,

        While all paraview features work perfectly fine for my
unstructured mesh output, I cannot get streamlines to show up (or they
are too small to see). This only happens on warped geometries -- if the
geometry is a Cartesian box, everything works.
I've tried the CleanToGrid feature to align nodes and avoid holes due to
roundoff in the mesh, but not had any success.
It must be some simple problem, for instance caused by not perfectly
aligned elements, but I do not see the problem. I'd highly appreciate
any hint.

Here is a small test example where I have the problem (I use v3.4 but
have tried other versions as well)

Thanks everybody,

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView 3.6.2 Release Announcement
Message-ID: <a44d4ae01001041411u684e5e55o9135013367651e36@mail.gmail.com>

Hello All,

Kitware, Sandia National Laboratories and Los Alamos National Lab are proud
to announce the release of ParaView 3.6.2. The binaries and sources are
available for download from the ParaView website (
http://www.paraview.org/paraview/resources/software.html). ParaView 3.6.2
contains the following new features and improvements.

The Python interface has been revamped, an exciting new extension to the
Paraview Python interface is Python trace. The goal of trace is to generate
human readable, not overly verbose, Python scripts that mimic a user's
actions in the GUI. See the "Python Trace" article on page 6 of the October
2009 Kitware Source for more details.

ParaView 3.6.2 includes a collection of statistics algorithms. You can
compute descriptive statistics (mean, variance, min, max, skewness,
kurtosis), compute contingency tables, perform k-means analysis, examine
correlations between arrays, and perform principal component analysis on
arrays.  More information about these filters is available on the ParaView
Wiki at http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Statistical_analysis.

ParaView 3.6.2 includes the VisTrails Provenance Explorer plugin in the
Windows and Linux packages. VisTrails is an open-source scientific workflow
and provenance management system developed at the University of Utah that
provides support for data exploration and visualization. The VisTrails
Pplugin brings provenance tracking and many of the benefits of provenance to
ParaView users. It automatically and transparently tracks the steps a user
followed to create a visualization. In contrast to the traditional undo/redo
stack, which is cleared whenever new actions are performed, the plugin
captures the complete exploration trail as a user explores different
parameters and visualization techniques. A tree-based view of the history of
actions allows a user to return to a previous version in an intuitive way,
undo bad changes, compare different visualizations, and be reminded of the
actions that led to a particular result. Also, there is no limit on the
number of operations that can be undone, no matter how far back in the
history of the visualization they are. Last, but not least, the history is
persistent across sessions. The VisTrails plugin can save all of the
information needed to restore any state of the visualization in .vt files,
which can be reloaded across ParaView sessions and shared among
collaborators. This also allows multiple visualizations to be shared with a
single file.

LANL's cosmo plugin is now distributed with ParaView 3.6.2. This plugin
allows ParaView to read and process *.cosmo format files, in which particles
are described by mass, velocity and identification tags. These particles
typically represent stellar masses. The halo finder filter is a
friend-of-a-friend particle clustering algorithm. It creates groups
containing particles that satisfy a tolerance/threshold linking distance
criterion. The cosmology data format, halo finding algorithm, and related
(experimental) filter implementations are made possible by the LANL
cosmology researchers, the LANL visualization team, and international
collaborators.

Mac application bundle and comand line tools are now built as universal
binaries (PPC and Intel i386). This simplifies managing ParaView on Mac as
now there is only a single binary to download for any architecture.

As always, we rely on your feedback to make ParaView better and powerful. We
are experimenting with a new user-feedback mechanism. Please use

Subject: [Paraview] base proxy shows up in filters and sources menu and
	causes segfault
Message-ID: <4B429F01.2020403@gmail.com>

After a recent cvs update I have noticed that base proxies for my server 
manager xml show up in the filters and sources menus clicking on them 
causes immediate segfault. These shouldn't show up in the menus, its a 
recent thing.

For example I have

    <ServerManagerConfiguration>
    <ProxyGroup name="sources">

    <Proxy name="SourceUI">
      ...
    </Proxy>

    <SourceProxy
        name="Source1"
        class="vtkSource1"
        label="Reader 1"
        base_proxyname="SourceUI"
        base_proxygroup="sources">
    ...
    </SourceProxy>

    <SourceProxy
        name="Source2"
        class="vtkSource2"
        label="Reader 2"
        base_proxyname="SourceUI"
        base_proxygroup="sources">
    ...
    </SourceProxy>

    </ServerManagerConfiguration>
    </ProxyGroup name>

in the sources menu I'll see menu items for SourceUI, Source1,  and 
Source2.

I don't think the SourceUI should be showing up in the menu items. I 
think it's a bug can anyone confirm?

It looks like PV is now scanning the server manager xml to get the 
menuitems because I haven't in my client xml named the base proxy 
anywhere. If that's the case it should probably skip making menu items 
for the base proxies. It also looks like there is a lot of changes going 
into the client and server manager xml files, is there any documentation 
on this as of yet?

No, I can't use the ensightwriter, neither with script python, nor with the GUI.
Is there a way to edit a new file Ensight? (add variable, change values...)

I am guessing that this is because the EnSight writer is now a bit out
of date. Does this work from the GUI at all?

The problem is I can put any value in the lineedit widget, ie without any constraint.
I would like to obtain the same interface as in Threshold, ie a slider + a lineedit with constraints such that only a value in the range of the scalar array may be entered.

Subject: [Paraview] Periodic End Correction Option in Temporal Shift Scale
Message-ID: <4B430E38.9070902@web.de>

Hello,

the Periodic End Correction Option in Temporal Shift Scale Filter
doesn't seem to have any influence to the rendering. According to the
vtk documentation (
http://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkTemporalShiftScale.html#a6841f89f32bb3393bcaf14eae7c197ca
) one should choose between a 0,1,2,3...N,0,1,2,3... series and a
0,1,2,3...N,1,2,3...N,1,2,3 series. But regardless of the option in paraview,
every time the latter series is applied. I am using paraview 3.6.1.

One can check this with the example pvsm files from bug 6307 ( http://public.kitware.com/Bug/view.php?id=6307 ). As the
original time steps 0 and 9 are identical, the time steps 9 and 10
should be duplicated in the periodic case if the option is set to false.
But unfortunately this is not the case. Can anybody reproduce this problem and maybe has a workaround?

Dear paraview developers/users:

I just downloaded the binary version of paraview-3.6.2 for linux 64.? When I tried to run it, I got "segmentation fault".

The binary version of paraview-3.6.1 runs fine.?

Any suggestion?

Thanks!

If you have voxels that are not voxels (i.e. they are warped), the
interpolation is likely to fail. As Ken said, you should use hexahedra
instead. Having said that, is there a reason why you are not using a
structured grid (i.e. curvilinear grid)? It looks like the data is
structured. A structured grid would be much more efficient
memory-wise.

ParaView by default puts a entry widget for ArrayRangeDomain. This is
done to handle the case where the range may change over time, but the
user wants to explicitly put a value that's beyond the current
timestep's range. The Threshold panel is a custom panel. Look at
Qt/Components/pqThresholdPanel.cxx to see how you can implement the
same for your filter.

Hi Xunlei,

Unfortunately, I don't know the answer. I suggest sending this to the
Xdmf list. Some of the Xdmf developers are on that list but not this
one. You can subscribe here:
http://www.kitware.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/xdmf

If the answer is that this can't be done with Xdmf, I'd be happy to
help with a custom reader.

What do you mean by "plotting vectors"? Are you using the glyph filter?

Subject: [Paraview] base proxy shows up in filters and sources menu and

Is this coming through a plugin? To not have it necessary for plugin
developers to create the GUI xml for their filters/sources to show up,
once started, ParaView automatically listens to any definitions that
get added and updates the menus. The easiest way to deal with your
scenario where you have a bunch of base-proxies that should not show
up in the menus, simply create a new group in the xml, say
"sources-bases" in which you can put all the base proxy definitions.

What is the type of the data (unstructured, curvilinear etc.)? Do you
have a single part or multiple parts?

This is a shortcoming of the glyph filter we should address in the
future. For now, you can apply "cell centers" and then the glyph. Cell
centers creates a new dataset where points represent the center of the
cells of the original dataset.

Aaaaaaahhhhh .... that does indeed work, thanks :-). I do observe that 
the color map for the resulting vectors is a bit off (I looked at all 5 
of them), I can't get any yellow to show up at all in any of them, is 
this a known issue ?

Tacky to self-reply, but the colors are AOK w/ the same dataset on PV 
3.2.1 (32-bit) under FC6 (64-bit) for me ....

Can you give us a small dataset that demonstrates the problem?

What color map are you using?  The current default color map has no yellow in it whereas the old color map (used in 3.2) does.

Re: [Paraview] Problems plotting vectors w/ Paraview 3.6.1-6.FC11.x86_64 .... What color map are you using?  The current default color map has no yellow in it whereas the old color map (used in 3.2) does.

-Ken <http://www.cs.unm.edu/%7Ekmorel>




How about the RGB map ? I looked at all 5 colormaps & saw no yellow in any of them, all very similar pastel blues, browns, purples & reds .... If that is as expected, then all is well, although I definitely prefer (the option of) the full RGB map from 3.2.n ....

Hi Pei, 

Can you try removing?/home/hsieh/paraview/paraview-3.6.2-Linux-x86_64/lib/paraview-3.6/libfontconfig.so.1. If it is gone it should attempt to use your system version of libfontconfig.

Hi all,
I am newbie in Paraview and I want to ask you something. Using Paraview I am going to realize the following mechanism. I've written a reader, where the additional thread receives the data from another program. How properly to update the reader? How to update the view?

Thanks!
Andrey.

I think I may have seen this before.  The solution was to delete my config files.  So, if Ken's idea below doesn't work, try deleting the config files.  Instructions on how to do it are on the Paraview WIKI.

It's there under the "Choose Preset" button.  Select the "Blue to Red Rainbow".

How about the RGB map ? I looked at all 5 colormaps & saw no yellow in any of them, all very similar pastel blues, browns, purples & reds .... If that is as expected, then all is well, although I definitely prefer (the option of) the full RGB map from 3.2.n ....

I cannot get any of the plugins that come with the ParaView 3.6.2 binary to work.  They all give me an error like the one attached.  Is there some problem with the build?

Which architecture are you trying? What version, Service Pack of Windows are
you using? I just reverified both 64 bit and 32 bit binaries in a clean VM
with no development tools and have no problems loading any of the plugins.
Very strange.

It is not easy to make ParaView update automatically when the data
changes because of VTK's demand driven nature, VTK's lack of thread
safety, and due to ParaView's client server architecture. Doing it
well is an active research topic.

Search the mailing list (ex
http://paraview.markmail.org/search/?q=in-situ#query:in-situ+page:1+mid:is7zpzmo75lmnihj+state:results)
about live data, real time visualization, or in-situ visualization for
guidelines about how to go about doing it yourself.

I wonder if you need to have the manifest files and the msvc dlls in
all the directories containing the plugins as well.

I just installed ParaView from the Kitware web page (XP, 32 bit).  I then loaded the VisIt reader plugin.  I then opened tire.silo from the visit data download (from the VisIt site).  Worked fine.

Anything else anyone wants me to test?

Actually that might not be a bad idea. We can even make it a option
that the user can uncheck, if he wants. Maybe we should look into that
for 3.8.

My pre-canned response for SP2 is to upgrade to SP3! ;-) I should mention
that the XP testing I did was with SP3 as SP2 is circa 2004.

If the computer does not have the msvc dlls installed or on a current 
path you need to package them also in the plugins directory. Another 
option would be for ParaView to do a silent install of the MSVC redist 
package instead of dumping the dll's/

Because perceptual studies show that human vision is quite bad at properly interpreting the rainbow colors as linear range of numbers.  There has been a push in the visualization community to discourage people from using it.

Here is a link to a paper that outlines in more detail the reasons for abandoning the rainbow color map and the design considerations in creating the new one.

Right you are :-/ .... I told it to make that the default, will that hold across sessions ? Why is full red-to-blue not the default any more ? TIA :-) ....

I do believe I have had this problem show up on a fresh VM images of 
SP3, but it could have only been SP2.

Okay I just created a virgin SP2 VM and get the same problem as Ken. If I
put the MSVC runtime in a particular Plugins directory (PointSprite for
example) then all is well. So the options are:

1. Run Windows update and get all the latest.
2. Install the VS2008 runtime redistributable by hand. (probably the
simplest option)

http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=A5C84275-3B97-4AB7-A40D-3802B2AF5FC2&displaylang=en
3. Have ParaView run the runtime redistributable (not an option until the
next release) as Robert suggested.

Ken,
Some bad news, this patch didn't solve the problem, the holes returned
on my first run.

Given that, is there some advice you can give for installing the MSVC classes on Windows XP stuck at SP 2?  How do you do that (without installing the entire compiler)?

Actually that might not be a bad idea. We can even make it a option
that the user can uncheck, if he wants. Maybe we should look into that
for 3.8.

The best you can probably do if you're stuck at SP2 is install the runtime
redistributable.

I tried adding the runtime redistributable.  The plugins now load without complaint, but they do not work.  The SLAC tools plugin does not create a toolbar like it is supposed to.  The point sprite plugin does not create the "Point Sprite" representation to the representation combo box.  The VisIt reader plugin allows you to open .silo files, but they always end up with empty data.

Does anyone have an idea why that is?  Could it be using two different sets of MSVC libraries?

Actually that might not be a bad idea. We can even make it a option
that the user can uncheck, if he wants. Maybe we should look into that
for 3.8.

Would you be able to run dependency walker, and report back the results?

Loading 2 sets of MSVC libraries would make sense. The normal paraView
libraries will find the c/c++ runtime libraries in the same directory
and load those. The plugins will find the c/c++ libraries where ever
the redistributable libraries are installed and thus load up a
separate set of libraries.

   You are better off simply building paraview on your own system.

 Of course, ParaView code could be changed to look for plugins in the
directory where the libraries are located which would solve the
problem. I think.

I've not seen multiple versions of the CRT load unless it was VS 8 and 
VS 9 compiled code used together combined.
Can you just remove the manifests from the plugins, by not embedding them?

I am afraid not. The writer needs to be updated to work with
multi-block datasets and that is not a straightforward thing. If you
had one part, the solution is pretty straightforward.

Does anyone have an idea why that is?  Could it be using two different sets of MSVC libraries?

Actually that might not be a bad idea. We can even make it a option
that the user can uncheck, if he wants. Maybe we should look into that
for 3.8.

When you profile ParaView does the main executable and plugins load the 
same MSVC dlls. ( F9 shows full paths of loaded dlls ).

If they don't load the same dlls, comparing the manifest files will 
determine if the problem is two different versions of the MSVC are being 
used.

Subject: [Paraview] paraview-3.6.2 and display wall
Message-ID: <19268.48170.594937.734167@medoc.limsi.fr>

Dear all,

  First of all I would like to congratulate the paraview developer team for
  releasing paraview-3.6.2. It is a great job and a great tool I use since 2.2
  release on my laptop and on a display wall since a couple of years.

  I installed, from source (gcc version 4.1.2, ofed-1.4, openmpi-1.3.2),
  paraview-3.6.2 on a cluster of 4 quadro FX-4500 graphic cards (driver
  117.82) running rocks-5.2/centos-5. Each graphic card is connected to an LCD
  screen.

  The latest release of paraview has solved many problems relating to 3.4 et
  3.6.1 versions on display walls. With 3.6.2, when displaying isocontours with
  "Interpolate scalars" toggle button selected and "opacity is less than 1
  in the display panel, different pieces of the displayed object appears on
  the wall. When "Interpolate scalars" toggle button is off (keeping opacity
  less than 1), the displayed object becomes clean on the wall without any
  pieces arround.

  Is there any experience with 3.6.2 on display walls ?

Happy new year.
Sincerely,
--

Burlen,

Is there any possible way you can send me some data or replicate the problem with something like the Mandelbrot source?  So far I have not been able to replicate it exactly.

Subject: [Paraview] Problem linking Cocoa pqWidgets
Message-ID: <10566667-3735-4E8C-B356-A6BAA5C5B8FF@cs.duke.edu>

Hello,

On one of my machines I just switched over to Snow Leopard, so I did a fresh CVS grab of ParaView. I have Qt 4.5.3 built from source for Cocoa (x86 and x86_64 architectures), and I have been trying to build ParaView (i386;x86_64), but keep getting a linking error on the pqWidgets library:

[ 90%] Built target QtTesting
Linking CXX shared library ../../bin/libpqWidgets.dylib
Undefined symbols:
  "_objc_msgSend", referenced from:
      pqProgressBarHelper::setProgress(int)    in pqProgressBarHelper.mm.o
      pqProgressBarHelper::setProgress(int)    in pqProgressBarHelper.mm.o
      pqProgressBarHelper::setProgress(int)    in pqProgressBarHelper.mm.o
ld: symbol(s) not found
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
Undefined symbols:
  "_objc_msgSend", referenced from:
      pqProgressBarHelper::setProgress(int)    in pqProgressBarHelper.mm.o
      pqProgressBarHelper::setProgress(int)    in pqProgressBarHelper.mm.o
      pqProgressBarHelper::setProgress(int)    in pqProgressBarHelper.mm.o
ld: symbol(s) not found

I found I can get past this if I add a "-framework Cocoa" to the linker line manually, so I think in ParaView3/Qt/Widgets/CMakeLists.txt maybe there should be another check added, something like (line 198):

  if(VTK_USE_COCOA)
    TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES(pqWidgets "-framework Cocoa")
  endif(VTK_USE_COCOA)

The progress bar doesn't really work and I'm running into the "grayed out filters" that some others have mentioned (filters show up right after launching PV, I can generate or load a "source", and I can apply one filter, but then they disappear after that and won't come back), but at least PV compiled... :)

Not sure if it's relevant, but in case it's helpful: On another machine with a very similar setup (Snow Leopard and x86,x86_64 Cocoa Qt 4.5.2 from source), but just CVS "update" and rebuild on an old checkout rather than a fresh one, I noticed that the pqWidgets_LIB_DEPENDS (and a bunch of other things) include ;general;-framework Carbon;general;-framework AppKit;general;-framework ApplicationServices;  The progress bar doesn't work on that version, either, but I don't get the "grayed out" filters problem.

Thanks,
-Eric

Subject: [Paraview] Image Filters And Changing Extent - Paraview 3.6.2
Message-ID: <1262808699.7331.25.camel@splatter.kin.ucalgary.ca>

In ParaView 3.6.2 it appears to be still impossible for a filter to have
output extent different than input extent.

Here is a relatively recent post from someone with the same issue.

http://markmail.org/message/frmcm2wnce3ye6ae

Is there any suggested work-around for this?

As a demonstration, I have attached ImageConstantPad.xml, which converts
the VTK class vtkImageConstantPad into a ParaView filter.  Regardless of
how much padding is requested, the output image will be no larger than
the input image.

Even when the extents are forced, by for example subclassing
vtkImageConstantPad and overriding UPDATE_EXTENT before calling
vtkImageConstantPad::Request_Data, thus forcing at least
vtkImageConstantPad itself to update correctly, subsequent filters in
the pipeline still receive the original (incorrect) UPDATE_EXTENT.

Did you use the CVS version of CMake?
FindQt4/UseQt don't put the extra dependencies in there anymore unless Qt is 
static.  So if pqWidgets uses Cocoa, it needs to link against the Cocoa 
framework.

Hey Clint,

Yes, I'm using CVS CMake (2.9.20100105). Qt is not static (unless that's the default, but I don't think it is).

So older versions of CMake added in other framework dependencies (like Carbon, ApplicationServices or AppKit) automatically based on what Qt was built with?

Thanks,
-Eric

The default is shared/dynamic.

Correct.  So, your suggestion to fix Qt/Widgets/CMakeLists.txt needs to happen.

Subject: [Paraview] cmake language syntax highlighting added to wiki
Message-ID: <c19fcadc1001061421n2891bd8by77508095c9ec233a@mail.gmail.com>

FYI anyone writing wiki pages -

On the Kitware wiki's, you can now use:

<source lang="cmake">
... cmake code here ...
</source>

(versus the old <source lang="text"> or manual syntax highlighting )

This looks much nicer than plain text, and is must less painful than
manual syntax highlighting.  I know many of the Paraview wiki pages
(http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/Plugin_HowTo#Writing_Plugins) use manual
syntax highlighting - should I update them to use lang="cmake"?

A comparison with plain text is here (for a few days - before I remove
the old text-only version):

Hi All,

I have tracked down the issue. That being an inconspicuous Visual Studio
Security update
(KB971092<http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/info.aspx?na=49&p=1&SrcDisplayLang=en&SrcCategoryId=&SrcFamilyId=294de390-3c94-49fb-a014-9a38580e64cb&u=http%3a%2f%2fsupport.microsoft.com%2f%3fkbid%3d971092>
) that was installed sometime after I did the 3.6.1 release. Binaries built
with that patch applied appear to not run on older revisions of XP (SP2).
 Thus, I have uninstalled the update, rebuilt ParaView 3.6.2 and uploaded
the regenerated binary to the download server. I have verified that it does
work on a clean SP2 machine BUT you must either install the Visual Studio
runtime redistributable (simple)

http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=A5C84275-3B97-4AB7-A40D-3802B2AF5FC2&displaylang=en

OR copy the runtime dlls (Microsoft.VC90.CRT.manifest, msvcm90.dll
msvcp90.dll msvcr90.dll) distributed with ParaView into each plugin's folder
(ugly) in order to get plugins to work.

Any one using an up-to-date Windows XP or newer (Vista,7) should be able
to disregard these directions.


Please report and further issues relating to this and thank you for the
feedback!

Can you fix that issue some people might have by not embedding the manifests 
into the plugin dlls, where embedding them is the default behavior?

So you're saying that if I don't embed any manifest (which the IDE does by
default) into the plugins it should just work?

The Qt deployment docs for Window says:
"If you are bundling the runtimes and need to deploy plugins as well, you have 
to remove the manifest from the plugins..."
"If you skip the step above, the plugins will not load on some systems."

So, its my guess that is why it doesn't work on non-updated systems.

Something like,

if (MSVC)
  # Do not generate manifests for the plugins - caused issues loading
plugins
  set(CMAKE_MODULE_LINKER_FLAGS "${CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS} /MANIFEST:NO")
endif(MSVC)

That was enough to fix the majority of the problems we saw with Qt plugins
on Windows.

Hit send a second too soon, it should be,

if (MSVC)
  # Do not generate manifests for the plugins - caused issues loading
plugins
  set(CMAKE_MODULE_LINKER_FLAGS "${CMAKE_MODULE_LINKER_FLAGS} /MANIFEST:NO")
endif(MSVC)

In order to append to the module linker flags.

Also, the progress bar issue is known - we will try to fix it before
2.8 but no guarantees. I never ran into the "grayed out filters"
issue. I have been using Qt 4.6 btw.

Subject: [Paraview] time series
Message-ID: <1B37BF36-3F80-45BC-94E5-52382091C98C@indiana.edu>

Can someone point me to an example/tutorial of time series data in Paraview?  I'm not even sure of the generally accepted VTK format(s) for such data.  For my simple case, I'd like to be able to specifiy [t0, f0(x,y)], ... [tN,fN(x,y)] where f(x,y) are scalars on a regular grid.

thanks!  -Randy

Message-ID: <224306b01001070444r49742778g11d5c4a09c4d4510@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,

I am trying to run compile ParaView on 64 bit openSUSE 11.2 with KDE
4.3.1. I was using this website as a reference
http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/ParaView:Build_And_Install. Unfortunately
after configuring the installation with ccmake I get
QT_HELP_GENERATOR-NOTFOUND in QT_HELP_GENERATOR variable. Executing
make ends up with an error:

[ 99%] Built target H5PartReader
[ 99%] Compiling Qt help project paraview.qhp
/bin/sh: QT_HELP_GENERATOR-NOTFOUND: command not found
make[2]: *** [Documentation/CMakeFiles/ParaViewOnlineHelp] Error 127
make[1]: *** [Documentation/CMakeFiles/ParaViewOnlineHelp.dir/all] Error 2

Could you let me know if you had any hints as to solve this problem? I
would be very much obliged for any assistance.

Kind regards,
Robert

Berk -- out of curiosity, then, is your Qt 4.6 built for both i386 and x86_64 architectures, and using Cocoa?

It doesn't necessarily make sense, but since I don't get the grayed out filters on my laptop which was using an older version of CMake (2.9.20091007) -- so it linked a bunch of PV libraries with additional OS X frameworks -- is it possible that with more recent CMake there are some other dependencies which are not being linked in, don't get caught at compile time, but are missing at run time?

Anyway, as long as someone can put in that extra Cocoa line for pqWidgets, at least that will build with CVS CMake.

Thanks,
-Eric

I used i386 (Carbon and Cocoa) initially but I am now using 64 bit
Cocoa exclusively.

What version of Qt are you using? Ensure that QT_HELP_GENERATOR is set
to the qhelpgenerator executable.

Hey Randy,

There are multiple formats ParaView can read which support time series, so what you use partly depends on what format your data is written in already. 

PV has built in some facility for reading a series of sequentially-named files as a time series, but if your data is irregularly spaced in time I don't think there is a way to specify the specific time steps for each data set that way. If it's handy for you to write the individual files as XML-based VTK files, you can then write a .pvd file which tells PV what time step goes with each file. (There are a couple examples of this in the ParaViewData, which you can download using CVS as described under Current Development Distribution on the ParaView Downloads page: http://paraview.org/paraview/resources/software.html )

If your data is in another format, check whether ParaView can already read it, or let us know and we might be able to help with how to convert it to another format or how to develop a PV reader.

Talk to you later,
-Eric

It's probably located at the same location as qmake. You might want to
look at openSUSE Qt package details to see if they even provide the
generator or if it's in a different package or something.

My Qt version is 4.5.3.

Where can I find this one? Apparently ccmake cannot find
autumatically. Maybe it is not supplied with openSUSE Qt package. Is
there any way to do it manually?

Hi all, disabling the manifest for the plugins worked! Thanks all for
pointing this out to me! Now the plugins use the runtime that we bundle with
ParaView and you will not need to install the redist package. I will update
the binaries and source downloads asap.

Thanks again!

Thanks again for the hints. It was indeed in a different package.
Can't say exactly which one since I simply added all the qt4 packages
that borne the signature of Trolltech. make and make install work just
fine now. Thank you!

Update your CVS and try again.  This looks like it is from a problematic checkin to VTK that has been reverted this morning.

In case anyone is interested, I'm not seeing the grayed out filters after doing a fresh build of Qt 4.6.0 from source, configured with: 

./configure -release -plugin-sql-sqlite -arch x86_64 -cocoa

(the sqlite is for another project), and building yesterday's CVS ParaView (with the change to ParaView3/Qt/Widgets/CMakeLists.txt that I mentioned in my original post) for x86_64 architecture under OS X 10.6.2 using CMake 2.9.20100105. 

Thanks,
-Eric

Message-ID: <AB48A31C4EC97E498F4235B7CEF74A1901E7E6D6CB@MBX00.d.ethz.ch>

I have tried compiling pv3.6.2 with my system's hdf5 and have run into the following issue:

regardless of what api-version I use to configure & compile hdf5 (v16 or v18), I cannot compile pv because of the following error:

/apps-vis/ParaView3-6-2/Utilities/Xdmf2/libsrc/XdmfH5Driver.cxx:174: error: braces around scalar initializer for type ?herr_t (*)(H5FD_t*, unsigned char*, unsigned int, hbool_t)?
Badly placed (.
/apps-vis/ParaView3-6-2/Utilities/Xdmf2/libsrc/XdmfH5Driver.cxx:174: error: invalid conversion from ?haddr_t (*)(H5FD_t*)? to ?herr_t (*)(H5FD_t*, H5FD_mem_t, hid_t, haddr_t, hsize_t)?
Badly placed (.

etc.

here is my last config for hdf5:

./configure --enable-parallel --enable-linux-lfs --enable-shared --with-default-api-version=v18

The good news:

I was able to make the compilation finish after copying XdmfH5Driver.cxx from the CVS version of ParaView. And so far in execution trials, nothing has broken.

Has anyone else seen this? I had initially configured hdf5 with the default (i.e without specifying the last option  --with-default-api-version=v??). I then tried with v16, and v18, and in both cases, I could not compile, until I overwrote the source with the cvs copy.

Subject: [Paraview] reading large collections of *vti files
Message-ID: <AB48A31C4EC97E498F4235B7CEF74A1901E7E6D6CC@MBX00.d.ethz.ch>

Folks

I have engaged into a conversion project, from XML PVTI files to HDF5 files. Although very convenient to store each processor's output into its own file, and then combining the whole thing into a single PVTI file, we now have the following challenge:

1) with several tens of thousands of computing cores, we end-up with several millions of VTI files for time dependent outputs. Reading the PVTI files which assemble all the pieces works, but it is very slow because of the fragmentation.
2) doing "ls" in the directory, or using the File browser to open files is very, very slow.

My data converter currently works on sets of 16,384 VTI files, and writes the whole global image to a single HDF5 file. One challenge I have found is that using the PXMLImageDataReader seems to use twice as much memory as required. I currently convert Images of resolution 881*881*3521 for 1 vector field. That is about 32 Gbytes. When read in parallel on 14 servers, the pvservers use over 5.2 Gb of memory, pushing me very dangerously over the swap limit. Yet, 32 Gb divided by 14 should occupy 2.3 Gb. In fact, reading back the data after conversion, using the Xdmf2 reader, my pvservers use exactly 2.3 Gb. I conclude that the Xdmf reader is very clean (and very efficient btw), and that the PXML*Reader appears to use way over too much memory.

Has anyone seen this behavior with memory and can offer tips to more efficiently read these large collections? I have collections from 4K to 22K files per timesteps.
TIA

In Gentoo we have a patch for XdmfH5Driver.cxx - It was introduced for 
paraview 3.6.1 but it may still be current. 
I am attaching for reference. One thing to note conditional compilation is
introduced for HDF5 v1.6 and 1.8. From the look of the patch the code
that is left alone is geared to HDF5 v1.8 but paraview ship with version 1.6
so paraview version may have been patched to include some v1.8 bits.
Most interesting are these 2 bits that are not conditional:

Subject: [Paraview] pythonnurbs inside ProgrammableFilter
Message-ID: <4B46F701.803@web.de>

Hello,

I am using pythonnurbs from http://pypi.python.org/pypi/PythonNURBS in
conjunction with the python bindings from vtk. As a standalone script it
works perfectly, but if I want to use it inside paraview with the
ProgrammableFilter it just works once a time. After that some errors
occur. Here is a simple python test code:

from pythonnurbs import NurbsCurve, NurbsPoint
curve=NurbsCurve.NurbsCurved()
curve.makeCircle(NurbsPoint.Point3Dd(0.0,0.0,0.0), 100.0)
u = 0.5
print curve.pointAt(u).getx(), curve.pointAt(u).gety(),
curve.pointAt(u).getz()

The following output is printed:

-100.0 0.0 0.0


If one changes for example:
u = 0.25

and want to re-execute the ProgrammableFilter again, the following error
occured

Traceback (most recent call last):

File "<string>", line 23, in <module>

File "<string>", line 5, in RequestData

File "/usr/lib64/python2.6/site-packages/pythonnurbs/NurbsCurve.py",
line 277, in makeCircle

def makeCircle(*args): return _NurbsCurve.NurbsCurved_makeCircle(*args)

NotImplementedError: Wrong number of arguments for overloaded function
'NurbsCurved_makeCircle'.

Possible C/C++ prototypes are:

makeCircle(PLib::NurbsCurve< double,3 > *,PLib::Point_nD< double,3 >
const &,PLib::Point_nD< double,3 > const &,PLib::Point_nD< double,3 >
const &,double,double,double)

makeCircle(PLib::NurbsCurve< double,3 > *,PLib::Point_nD< double,3 >
const &,double,double,double)

makeCircle(PLib::NurbsCurve< double,3 > *,PLib::Point_nD< double,3 >
const &,double)


while running the same code a second time in a normal python shell, the
output looks like the following:
0.0 100.0 0.0

One has to restart paraview and the python code in the
ProgrammableFilter works as expected (once a time). The error message is
not very helpful, as it says that this method is not implemented in the
way I'm using it. But that is not correct. Does anybody has an idea
what's the real problem? At first one could expect the problem is in
pythonnurbs (maybe it is, but not in the way the error message says),
but as the code works once a time, why does it not works twice?

Best regards,
Oliver Borm

I am guessing somehow the arguments passed to makeCircle are getting
clobbered. Can you post you Python code?

Do you mean the source code of pythonnurbs or my test code? Pythonnurbs itself is a python binding of the NURBS++ library using SWIG. This is the whole python code I'm using inside the ProgrammableFilter:

from pythonnurbs import NurbsCurve, NurbsPoint

curve=NurbsCurve.NurbsCurved()
curve.makeCircle(NurbsPoint.Point3Dd(0.0,0.0,0.0), 100.0)
u = 0.5
print curve.pointAt(u).getx(), curve.pointAt(u).gety(), curve.pointAt(u).getz()

Sorry, I assumed that you had more than those few lines. OK, this is
very weird. Can you simply print what
NurbsPoint.Point3Dd(0.0,0.0,0.0)
returns the first time and the second time?

Ok, here the test code:

from pythonnurbs import NurbsPoint

point = NurbsPoint.Point3Dd(100.0,0.0,0.0)

print(point)

print point.getx()


first time output:

<pythonnurbs.NurbsPoint.Point3Dd; proxy of <Swig Object of type
'PlPoint3Dd *' at 0x2d37710> >

100.0


second time output:

<pythonnurbs.NurbsPoint.Point3Dd; proxy of <Swig Object of type
'PlPoint3Dd *' at 0x2d37710> >


Traceback (most recent call last):

File "<string>", line 23, in <module>

File "<string>", line 5, in RequestData

File "/usr/lib64/python2.6/site-packages/pythonnurbs/NurbsPoint.py",

def getx(*args): return _NurbsPoint.Point3Dd_getx(*args)

TypeError: in method 'Point3Dd_getx', argument 1 of type
'PLib::Point_nD< double,3 > *'


Well if I do not access the point object, then it seems that all went
fine. But if I want to get any data from the point object, then I get
the error.

What happens if you run this in pvpython?

Subject: [Paraview] Automating slicing in Paraview
Message-ID: <SNT108-W40AE1CA20E8AB3673C1D288A700@phx.gbl>


Hello all

A quick question. Is it possible to generate a series of slices through a 3D volume at different levels automatically? I have a dataset which has data from -40km to -400 km, and I would like to take slices at say 50km, 100km, 150km etc to 400km (Z). 

At the moment it appears I have to do this one layer at a time.

Using Paraview 3.6.1 (Windows version)

That is what the slice offset values control is for. Apply the slice
filter and fill that with as many offsets as you want.

Hi David

 

Thanks for the information. I have just applied the filter and set the offsets giving a view of several slices through the volume. However, there is no way to move through the slices applied: the slice section of the display option is not selectable. What I need is to be able to scroll through the slices I want and go to the spreadsheet view and output the data as a CSV file. Althought the view has multiple slices visbile, I was expecting to see indiviual slices selectable somehow. Have I missed a step here?

 

Regards

 

Lester

Message-ID: <c19fcadc1001081444x37f9e359p97a22b90cda46082@mail.gmail.com>

I have made a plugin for a filter that generates a data array called
"Curvature". After I apply the filter in paraivew, I always
immediately go to the display tab and change "Color By" to
"Curvature". Is there a way to do this
automatically in the xml or somewhere else?

Thanks,

Subject: [Paraview] Filter pulldown menu grayed out
Message-ID: <20100108214230.suz5smlrs44wgcg0@webmail.opentransfer.com>

Hello,

I am testing a build of Paraview 3.6.2  on Mac OS X 10.6 Cocoa.  I am  
using Qt 4.5.3, and built for the x86_64 architecture.  After much  
trial and error, I got a .app package built, with my own filters  
installed in the Plugins folder of the .app.  That was pretty exciting.

The app runs, but after the first filter is chosen from the Filters  
menu, the Filters menu becomes grayed-out and filters are no longer  
accessible.  The first filter always loads and does what it is  
supposed to do.  This applies to any Filter, my own or one from the  
standard distribution.

Further, if I delete the items in the pipeline, and load a new source  
or from a new reader, the Filters menu continues to be grayed out.  It  
basically lets me choose one filter per session.

Is this me being bone-headed, or has anyone else encountered something  
like this?  If I must, I will revert to a build for Carbon and i386.   
Hopefully I've learned enough from the past five weeks of  
trial-and-error the downgrade wouldn't be too difficult.

Any thoughts?

Thanks,
Erik

Hey Erik,

I recently ran into this problem, too. I was building CVS ParaView for both i386 and x86_64 using Qt 4.5.3 built for both of those architectures, too, and using Cocoa. The problem went away when I switched to Qt 4.6.0 built for only x86_64 (Cocoa) and built ParaView for that architecture, too. I didn't do a systematic series to see which of these changes (single x86_64 arch or Qt 4.6.0 or both) made the difference, but it works now and hopefully will work for you with PV 3.6.2.

Talk to you later,

Subject: [Paraview] Memory leak in Paraview 3.6.1(?)
Message-ID: <4B488FE2.2030907@web.de>

Hi -

My typical work-flow involves generating a batch of VTK files, for which 
I also generate a python script for the VTK files.

In preparation for the next simulation, I clear Paraview with the 
disconnect icon. My experience with Paraview 3.6.1 in this scenario is 
that, the memory consumption steadily grows, even though no objects 
currently loaded/displayed.

Is there a way to configure Paraview so that it releases memory in the 
same way Firefox can be configured to use less memory (see for example 
http://windhair1000.blogspot.com/2009/03/how-to-fix-firefox-memory-leak.html 
-- BTW, I recently made these changed to my FF config, and it made a 
massive difference).

Thanks,

- Olumide

What happens if you put all of these in a function and call that
function twice? That's what the GUI does.

Subject: [Paraview] H5Part patches
Message-ID: <87ocl3xa9k.fsf@59A2.org>

There is no way for H5PART_HAS_MPI to be set, therefore H5PartTypes.h:

  #ifndef H5PART_HAS_MPI
  typedef int  MPI_Comm;
  #endif

conflicts (dangerously) with Open MPI which uses

  typedef struct ompi_communicator_t *MPI_Comm;

The first attached patch is a workaround for this (the build system
should also be fixed, but note that mpi.h *will* be included if HDF5 was
built with parallel support, therefore H5Part cannot use the typedef
even when it is not being built with parallel support).


Also, H5Part still relies on HDF5's 1.6 API.  The second patch is tested
with with HDF5-1.8, but should work fine with 1.6 as well (it's silly to
rely on globally defining H5_USE_16_API because then nobody will update
their components).

It works like expected:

...     print point.getx()
...
>>> getPointX()
0.0
>>> getPointX()
0.0

Even with an additional argument:

Subject: [Paraview] Data interpolation in Paraview
Message-ID: <SNT108-W24029445CC74A541F23EEC8A6D0@phx.gbl>


Hello

A quick query. I have created a structured grid from a series of layers in a data table (Table to StructuredGrid), generating a nice interpolated dataset for filtering (slice, clip etc.) Does Paraview use a proper data interpolation method (and if so which) to compute values between the control layers or is it merely a graphical interpolation?

Essentially I have 11 layers which have computed values, with depths in the range 4 0 to 400 km.

Hopefully someone can clarify this point.

Lester

Subject: [Paraview] Slicing options - between set X/Y point limits
Message-ID: <SNT108-W349CD1317A786585D6A668A6D0@phx.gbl>


Hello

Is it possible to slice a volume without having to always have the maximum limits? For example, my data has x= -22 to 22 and Y= -22 to 22, but I only want to make a vertical slice between the points P1 (x=2 Y=-10) to P2 (X=8 Y=-6): I cannot see an option in version 3.6.2 (Win32) to do that. The only options relate to the angle of the slice and its origin slicing through the whole model - have I missed something ?

Cheers

Lester

No.  But I think if you change your filter to set the Curvature array as the active scalars on the output, ParaView will automatically select them.

That depends on what you mean by hardware acceleration.  IceT is designed to work with images rendered with OpenGL and the assumption is that you are using graphics hardware to generate the images.  So the best answer is that IceT is perfectly capable of hardware acceleration is is quite frequently used in this mode.

Subject: [Paraview] File->Save Animation bug while connected to pvserver?
Message-ID: <4B4B5A66.7090002@lanl.gov>

Is there a current known bug with Save Animation while connected to a 
parallel pvserver in ParaView 3.6.1 and on?

I've seen it in CVS ParaView (in particular on a Mac OSX Snow Leopard), 
and a colleague of mine has seen it as well on 3.6.1 (on a Mac XServe 
not sure what version, so it might be a Mac problem) such that Save 
Animation is saving the same frames, and not updating the output frames 
to the subsequent time steps.

The behavior appears that the frame update is intermittent (sometimes a 
new frame will be written, but then that one will be repeated for many 
frames).  It feels like a race condition such that the frame refresh 
hasn't happened when the readback and file write occurs.  Maybe the 
parallel composition hasn't completed yet?

I can tell the filters and new time steps are being read and the filters 
are running, though, so it's not just the time steps are not being updated.

I haven't tried it on serial/builtin, but according to my colleague, 
that works, but it fails on a parallel (which is rendering) backend.

Folks,

I've committed a fix for this. The updating of the user's servers.pvsc
file was totally unnecessary (there was code elsewhere that handled
BUG #5487). However the user selections for only those <Option />
elements that have the "save" attribute set to true are preserved
across sessions.

Refer to
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView:Server_Configuration#Case_Eight:_Starting_server_using_ssh

for details on the "save" attribute. I am wondering if that's even
needed and we can always save all options i.e. assume "save" is true
by default. What do you think?

Utkarsh,

Is there a reason why we should not save all options as opposed to just
those with the "save" attribute?  I cannot think of a good use case to not
save an option, and even if there is a good use case wouldn't it be rare
enough to justify saving by default and having an attribute to turn off
saving?  Furthermore, until you made that change the behavior has been to
save all of the options, and to my knowledge no one has complained about
that.

-Ken

Subject: [Paraview] Saving screen shots of multiple views from an animation
	with python
Message-ID: <4B4B8FF9.8090507@web.de>

Hello,

is it possible to save the screen shots of multiple views from an
animation in different images with python? In the GUI this is possible,
when two views are open. But the two views are saved within one image,
which is not really optimal for further post-processing. I've tried to
do the same within python, but I only can render the two views in two
windows. When I try to save the views, just the last view is saved. Does
anybody know, how to fix this? Here is my test script, with the input
from (
http://public.kitware.com/Bug/file_download.php?file_id=2755&type=bug ) :

from paraview.simple import *

casefilename = "phaselag_rotor2.pvd"
reader = servermanager.sources.PVDReader(FileName=casefilename)

trans = Transform(Input=reader)
trans.Transform.Rotate = [0.0,0.0,90.0]

view1 = CreateRenderView()
repn1 = servermanager.CreateRepresentation(reader, view1)

view2 = CreateRenderView()
repn2 = servermanager.CreateRepresentation(trans, view2)

scene = servermanager.animation.AnimationScene()
scene.TimeKeeper = servermanager.misc.TimeKeeper()

scene.TimeKeeper.TimeSources.append(reader)

scene.TimeKeeper.Views.append(view1)
scene.TimeKeeper.Views.append(view2)

# with 2 views
scene.ViewModules = [view1, view2]
# Update the reader to get the time information
reader.UpdatePipelineInformation()
# Animate from 1st time step to last
scene.StartTime = reader.TimestepValues.GetData()[0]
scene.EndTime = reader.TimestepValues.GetData()[-1]

# Create a special animation cue for time.
cue = servermanager.animation.TimeAnimationCue()
cue.AnimatedProxy = scene.TimeKeeper
cue.AnimatedPropertyName = "Time"
scene.Cues = [cue]

scene.PlayMode = 1 #RealTime
## play the animation in two windows
scene.Play()

# Each frame will correspond to a time step
scene.PlayMode = 2 # Snap to time steps
writer = servermanager.vtkSMAnimationSceneImageWriter()
writer.SetFileName("fubar.png")
writer.SetFrameRate(1)
writer.SetAnimationScene(scene.SMProxy)

Subject: [Paraview] Animation view - rotation about the vertical axis
Message-ID: <7ed05c251001111451v3c27d869l7c97075138d8c34@mail.gmail.com>

Hey everybody,

I'm trying to do a short animation. I need to rotate a block about the
vertical axis. For the moment, I'm doing a rotation and a translation in a
same time, but the block did not rotate about the vertical axis, and
moreover, it is not so nice!!

Is there another way to do it?

Thanks for help.

Am I missing something, or would we also save the --connect-id flag between sessions?  This needs to be new, and random, each and every time we run.

This was the reason that the save option was put into Paraview - so we wouldn't save the --connect-id variable.

One possibility is to write a Python script that create n filters, one
for each slice. You can then use the visibility setting to move
between slices. Another one is to setup an animation that has n frames
and set the right offset value for each frame. You can then use the
animation controls to move back and forth between slices.

We are going to use Qt 4.6 for the ParaView 3.8 release so I recommend
that everyone building cvs use that (despite the warning about it not
being officially supported). Please let us know if you can reproduce
this with Qt 4.6.

The problem went away when I switched to Qt 4.6.0 built for only x86_64 (Cocoa) and built ParaView for that architecture, too. I didn't do a systematic series to see which of these changes (single x86_64 arch or Qt 4.6.0 or both) made the difference, but it works now and hopefully will work for you with PV 3.6.2.

ParaView uses trilinear interpolation inside hexahedra.

The slice filter does not have that option. However, you can achieve
something similar by first creating a plane (use the Plane source and
the Transform filter to get it to be the right size, resolution and
orientation) and the  using the Resample with Dataset filter.

Utkarsh would know this best but I think you have at lease two choices:

* Run the animation multiple times, one for each view. I am guessing that there
is a way of setting which view is saved.
* Run the animation manually (still using the animation scene) and save the
views yourself.

Hy !
 
I have a power wall with 3 Displays and used it with mpirun -np 3 -maschinfile maschine.txt /bin/env DISPLAY=:0 pvserver -tdx=3 -tdy=1
 
if i use it in mono display no problem  as soon as i use it with stereo i get a kind of stereo display with not the right eyedistance for VTK_STEREO_CRYSTALL eyes . Is there a secound parameter in the .xml  rendering.xml or in the coder vtkrendering.cxx ?
 
thank you

To pick just of the two views, only add one of the two views to the
scene i.e.scene.ViewModules = [view1] etc.

I've ensured that when "random" is specified as the default value for
any option, which is the case with --connect-id, then the value is
always regenerated, so this will be a non-issue. Also you can always
add save="false" attribute, if needed -- but not necessary in this
case.

Here is what you do:

* Create a slice filter
* Turn on the Animation View (View -> Animation View)
* Set the number of frames to however many slices you want
* Add a new track for Slice - Slice Offset Values
* Double click on the track and add the values you want
  (this should look like the image attached)
* Use the animation controls to switch between slice values

It is probably easy to write a Python macro to do that but I don't
know the animation API well enough to figure it out quickly.

Best,

Subject: [Paraview] Problems with ParaView 3.6.2 and VTKEdge
Message-ID: <00fe01ca93a0$7825e400$4f2810ac@win.ara>

Dear All,

I've recently updated to the release version of ParaView 3.6.2. I've managed
to compile VTKEdge again, but anytime I have it loaded and attempt to load a
data file I get a segmentation fault. ParaView works fine when it isn't
loaded. It appears as though it is crashing out after all data has been read
in and it is about to display to screen. I've tried to force it to display
an outline representation initially, but it still crashes.

Has anyone else had this problem?

Regards,

Adriano

Message-ID: <4B4C9A08.4030508@onera.fr>

Hello.

Help menu in PV 3.6.2 works on Linux but not on Windows Vista 32 where 
it gives an error from Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime library:

> Runtime error!
>
> Program: C:\Program Files\Paraview 3.6.2\bin\assistant.exe
>
> R6034
> An application has made an attempt to load the C runtime library 
> incorrectly.
> Please the application's support time for more information.
In addition, the PV Output window shows "Qt assistant crashes"

This is quite different from the problem I had with PV 3.6.1 (see 
previous mails) and that I could solve.

Any idea for this one?

Best regards.

Hi Richard, thanks for your report. I will take a look.

I should mention that I was able to get it to work fine with
ParaView-3.6.2-rc1.

Subject: [Paraview] Problems with ParaView 3.6.2 and VTKEdge

Dear All,

I've recently updated to the release version of ParaView 3.6.2. I've managed
to compile VTKEdge again, but anytime I have it loaded and attempt to load a
data file I get a segmentation fault. ParaView works fine when it isn't
loaded. It appears as though it is crashing out after all data has been read
in and it is about to display to screen. I've tried to force it to display
an outline representation initially, but it still crashes.

Has anyone else had this problem?

Regards,

Adriano

Hi Zhanping,
 
This is in linux and I have already included the VTKEdge/bin directory to my
PV_PLUGIN_PATH environment variable, and the .so appears under Manage
Plugins/Extensions.
 
I'll double-check my compilation and make sure I haven't missed anything
out.
 
Cheers,
 
Adriano

If you are using Windows, then
 
(1) open a DOS cmd window
(2) go to ParaView_Build\bin\debug\
(3) set PATH=%PATH%;VTKEdge_Build\bin\debug
(4) paraview
 
I once encountered a similar problem. After including the VTKEdge dir to

Utkarsh,

I'm using an older version of VTKEdge that was downloaded at the same time
as 3.6.2-RC1, and worked fine with it. I am still having the same problem
with 3.6.2 so maybe something has changed as you said.

Regards,

Adriano

Yes that would be possible, but this would invoke the whole
visualization pipeline for each timestep in each animation, with the
call of writer.Save(). If I do it this way, right?

## save files of animation
scene.ViewModules = [view1]
writer.SetFileName("fubar1.png")
writer.Save()

## save files of animation
scene.ViewModules = [view2]
writer.SetFileName("fubar2.png")
writer.Save()

But if one has a large data set with a couple of filters where each
update of a timestep would need a couple of minutes, then the overhead
in computation time to render several different views of the same
visualization pipeline is very small, compared to reinvoke the whole
visualization pipeline for all timesteps just for another view of the
same final visualization state. Therefore I'm looking for an efficient
method in order to do that.

Do you mean to run the animation with scene.Play() and then save the
screenshots of the popped up windows by hand? This would be possible,
but it is not exactly, what I expect from an automated python script
(then option one is in that case, my preferred one).

Yes you are correct.

Not really, I think Berk means this:

for cur_time in  reader.TimestepValues.GetData()[:]:
    scene.AnimationTime = cur_time
    WriteImage("foo1.%f.png" % cur_time, view1);
    WriteImage("foo2.%f.png" % cur_time, view2);

Subject: [Paraview] Octree Mesh
Message-ID: <cbc405b1001121300v6702ea7em254244049f1a2374@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I am rather new to paraview and I work in the area of CSE. The typical
meshes that I use to discretize my PDEs over is the 3D Octree data
structure. I was just wondering if anyone is aware of a dedicated dataset in
paraview to handle such meshes? I can go ahead and export my data in a way
that can be loaded as an unstructured dataset, but I'd prefer to use a
specific dataset for Octrees.

One more question. When I use, say, a simple structured 3D mesh and use the
slice filter to generate the corresponding mesh on a surface(through
wireframe) it just shows me some extra diagonal lines on each square cell,
which it should not.

Any help will greatly be appreciated.

Best,
-M

Thanks a lot, this would be an option. As in that case, a reinvokation
of the pipeline is also not needed for each view.

Switching to Qt 4.6.0 fixed the issue with the grayed-out filter menu.

The application seems to run pretty well.  The only problem I've  
noticed is that when I load a saved state, there seems to be a Qt  
drawing issue.  The display area is gray when it should display the  
output of a contour, and this message is thrown to the Output Messages:
QWidget::repaint: Recursive repaint detected

That's not a show-stopper for me.  I'm happy to have made it this far!

Subject: [Paraview] netCDF reader
Message-ID: <4B4D196A.9010406@cea.fr>

Hi all,

Testing the netCDF reader with "spherical coordinates" set, I get
a vtkStructured Grid incomplete. There is no circular topology.
I was expecting a complete sphere where points from first column would be
connected to points from last column in the vtkStructuredGrid created.

Is there a way to do this from an existing filter or from
the python programmable filter ?
Or better could the netCDF reader be corrected 
(VTK/IO/vtkNetCDFCOARDSReader.cxx) ?

By the past, I have installed and used the external plugin CSCSnetCDF 
reader
from John Biddiscombe of the Swiss National Supercomputing Centre.
I was quite happy with it.
Today, I discover that paraview binairies are distributed with the 
netCDFCOARDS reader
with some features I don't like. For example, that fact that the vtk 
structure created
are different following the netCDF grid topology (regular spacing or 
not, spherical coordinates or not).

I think it would be attractive for all the General Circulation Model 
(GCM)/ /community 
to provide a netCDF reader, closer to the CF (Climate and Forecast 
netCDF convention) widely adopted.
This reader would create for example a same vtkPolydata structure 
whatever the netCDF grid read
as in the vtk application described from 
http://www.prism.enes.org/Publications/Reports/Report19.pdf

Is there any interest to develop this netCDFCF reader among offcial dev 
team ?

Thanks
Patrick

Just another data point:
   OS X 10.5.8 Intel.
   Qt 4.5.3 built for i386 and x86_64 (Cocoa)
   ParaView 3.6.2 Release source downloaded and built with i386 Arch.

Grayed out filter after loading a data set (.vti file in my case). I  
guess I too will try Qt 4.6.0 and see what happens.

Hi Dave.

PV 3.6.2 help from the new installer is now working on Windows Vista 32.
Thank you for solving quickly this issue.
I will test further this new release in following days.

Best regards.

Subject: [Paraview] Octree Mesh

Hi,

With respect to the slicing; you could try to use the Extract Cells By 
Region filter, instead of the slice filter; my structured grid -- 
consisting of cubic cells -- is then sliced in the expected way keeping 
the cell structure as it was, whereas the slice tool seems to create an 
unstructured mesh first hereby generating additional edges, resulting in 
the triangular mesh that you see.

I'm also looking for a robust way to write out my OctTree meshes. Here's 
how I do it now, assuming cubic cells;

Create a point dataset (.vtp, .csv, .vtk) with a variable called 'size', 
the point coordinates at the cell centers. Then generate a glyph on this 
dataset, set it to cubes with size of course the variable that you have 
in the file. You can of course color the glyphs with any other variable 
in your dataset.

This saves you the trouble of generating 8 points per cubic cell and 
conncting them properly in your output files as you would in an 
unstructured mesh datafile. But still I'm convinced that there is 
(should be) an easier way of doing this.

Best,
Ivo

Is there any way to generate strings of 3D extruded text using Paraview? I
would like to do it outside of the GUI to automate the process as much as
possible and make it easy to repeat for different strings.

Thanks for your help in advance,

Subject: [Paraview] netCDF reader
In-Reply-To: <4B4D196A.9010406@cea.fr>
Message-ID: <C7733BD3.10AD9%kmorel@sandia.gov>

The netCDF reader in ParaView implements the COARDS convention, which is a subset of the CF convention.  To the best of my knowledge, both conventions define the spherical coordinates in the same way.  So if you have a netCDF file containing the CF convention for latitude and longitude, then the ParaView netCDF reader should understand that.

That said, I see that the netCDF reader will only actually create spherical coordinates for 3D grids.  I am not sure I remember the logic behind that, but I think it was that in general it is usually better to visualize a map surface as a 2D projection to prevent occlusion and that it is ambiguous what the height of the surface should be.  That said, it is easy to implement spherical coordinates to 2D grids.  I just checked in a change that creates a sphere at radius 1.

The idea of the netCDF reader outputting a vtkPolyData is unworkable.  Many netCDF files contain 3D grids, and vtkPolyData is incapable of representing those.  It could always output a vtkUnstructuredGrid, but this is a highly inefficient format for storing the structured arrays stored in netCDF COARDS files.  It is conceivable that the netCDF reader could always output a vtkStructuredGrid.  But that means that non-COARDS files are forced to also output vtkStructuredGrid and they loose the features for using vtkImageData.  I know there are issues with the VTK/ParaView pipeline when you change the output of the reader when you change the dimensions.  But there are also similar problems when you change the extent and dimensionality anyway, so I don't know how much help such a change would make.

Hi all,

Testing the netCDF reader with "spherical coordinates" set, I get
a vtkStructured Grid incomplete. There is no circular topology.
I was expecting a complete sphere where points from first column would be
connected to points from last column in the vtkStructuredGrid created.

Is there a way to do this from an existing filter or from
the python programmable filter ?
Or better could the netCDF reader be corrected
(VTK/IO/vtkNetCDFCOARDSReader.cxx) ?

By the past, I have installed and used the external plugin CSCSnetCDF
reader
from John Biddiscombe of the Swiss National Supercomputing Centre.
I was quite happy with it.
Today, I discover that paraview binairies are distributed with the
netCDFCOARDS reader
with some features I don't like. For example, that fact that the vtk
structure created
are different following the netCDF grid topology (regular spacing or
not, spherical coordinates or not).

I think it would be attractive for all the General Circulation Model
(GCM)/ /community
to provide a netCDF reader, closer to the CF (Climate and Forecast
netCDF convention) widely adopted.
This reader would create for example a same vtkPolydata structure
whatever the netCDF grid read
as in the vtk application described from
http://www.prism.enes.org/Publications/Reports/Report19.pdf

Is there any interest to develop this netCDFCF reader among offcial dev
team ?

Thanks
Patrick

Subject: [Paraview] Setting a string property from list in information_only
 property
Message-ID: <C7736038.10B00%kmorel@sandia.gov>

I have a reader that in RequestInformation loads a list of dimensions (represented by strings) and then requires that the user selects one of these dimensions.  I need the corresponding object inspector panel to show a combo box that gets populated with the list of strings provided by the reader and then set the selected string to the selection property.  I basically want something similar to the existing variable selection except that you are only able to select exactly one of the "variables".

Is there a way to do this?  I tried using an ArraySelectionDomain, but that gave me a list with checkboxes, which is no good because you are only allowed to select one.  I also got a bunch of errors which I think are related to the panel trying to set two elements in a property that only accepts one.  I also tried an ArrayListDomain like below.  This gave a combo box, but it has nothing in it.  Any suggestions?

     <StringVectorProperty name="VariableDimensionInfo"
                            command="GetVariableDimensions"
                            information_only="1">

I just want to pick up the discussion about the transformation of
vectors with the transform filter. As stated in bug 7387, only the
"active" vectors are transformed properly. As I tried from my simple
test case (see attachment), "active" vectors just means the last vector
in the vector list is properly transformed, which is the active one. Is
this correct? That means, when I use the ArrayCalculator or the
ComputeDerivatives Filter, I cannot use the transform filter afterwards,
or I have to transform all the vectors and tensors (except the last one)
by hand with an additional ArrayCalculator for each of these variables.
Furthermore, if I have to animate for example the rotation of the
TransformFilter I will in addition also have to animate the
FunctionalExpression of each of the additional ArrayCalculators in order
to transform the vectors correctly. This is in my opinion very error
prone and a lot of additional work if one has a lot of transform filters
and vectors.

Well maybe not every 3-tuple is a vector, but most of them are (in my
opinion), and transforming just the last vector is a worse idea, than
transforming each 3-tuple. Because nobody knows if the last vector is a
real vector or not. Therefore I want to ask if there is any possibility
to transform all 3-tuples and 9-tuples and not just the last 3-tuple of
the list (till there is some additional magic for the transform filter
available in order to choice, which vectors should be transformed and
which not)?

Subject: [Paraview] Patch for pqPluginManager to better readability
Message-ID: <DB3507C1-04DD-4F63-BE13-52C978427C66@bluequartz.net>

I was trying to diagnose why ParaView was not loading some of my  
plugins and it occurred to me that the dialog box for loading plugins,  
while somewhat verbose, is not that easy to interpret:

ParaView.app/Contents/MacOS/../Plugins;ParaView.app/Contents/ 
MacOS/../../Plugins.

  I was thinking it would be easier if it just read:

[Path To ParaView]/ParaView.app/Contents/Plugins;[Path To ParaView]/ 
Plugins;

So in pqPluginManager.cxx, down around line 471 I have the following:

#if defined (Q_OS_MAC)
//Look in the Application Package "ParaView.app/Contents/Plugins
QDir appDir (QCoreApplication::applicationDirPath());
appDir.cdUp();
pv_plugin_path += appDir.absolutePath() + QDir::separator() +  
"Plugins;";
//Look for a folder called "Plugins" at the same level as ParaView.app
appDir.cdUp();
appDir.cdUp();
pv_plugin_path += appDir.absolutePath() + QDir::separator() +  
"Plugins;";
//Look for a plugins at the same level as ParaView.app
pv_plugin_path += appDir.absolutePath() + QDir::separator() + ";";
#else
     pv_plugin_path += QCoreApplication::applicationDirPath() +  
QDir::separator()
       + "plugins";
#endif

Thoughts from anyone?

Also, I noticed that while plugins are built into the  
$PARAVIEW_BINARY_DIR/bin they are not automatically loaded from there?  
In the patch above, an additional line is there to add this directory  
to the list of directories to check. At least on OS X, this makes it  
easier to debug plugins? Or am I missing something completely? I know  
about PV_PLUGIN_PATH but really consider that a hack. Thoughts?

Subject: [Paraview] Clip filter bogs down after repeated Clip Type changes
Message-ID: <18B4AC86-2A41-459F-B6F1-69CFF32FE620@cs.duke.edu>

Hello,

I noticed something strange when debugging a variation on the clip filter as a plugin, but found that it happens with the standard Clip filter, too. If you switch repeatedly back and forth between Clip Types (Applying in between), the filter starts getting slower and slower and eventually bogs downs completely. To demonstrate:

Create a default Wavelet Source
Clip Filter -> Apply
Switch from Plane to Box Clip Type -> Apply
Switch back to Plane Clip Type -> Apply
Repeat last two...

After switching clip types about a dozen times I can see a few second delay before the new clipped data shows up in the render view, and by 13 it takes many seconds to show up. Memory use seems to increase on each iteration, but from about 85 to 110 Mb over those steps, so it's not enormous by the end... If you delete the Clip filter and create a new one, it starts over fresh (w/o memory usage drop) and you can repeat the same eventual slowdown.

(I can get this to happen both on Mac OS X 10.6.2 x86_64 Cocoa CVS Paraview built with CVS CMake, as well as on today's Ubuntu 9.10 32-bit PV 3.6.2 binary download -- haven't tried any others yet.)

Any ideas?

Thanks,
-Eric

Kenneth,
Thank you for your answer.
Indeed my main reproach for that filter is that I get different 
structures (a vtkImage or a vtkRectilinear Grid or a vtkStructuredGrid)
following the netCDF grid read.
COARDS convention deals with regular grids in a sens that the cross 
product of the coordinates variables (1D) define the grid.
Define different structures because the grid has regular spacing or not 
is not what I would have computed.
I am doing some tests and I will propose something using only 
vtkStructuredGrid.

I have identified those points which causes problems with the actual 
/ParaView3/VTK/IO/vtkNetCDFCOARDSReader.cxx
- if a regular spacing coordinate variable decreases (90 to -90 for 
example), you always get a vtkRectilinear grid.
It should reach, wth the computing choice made, to the creation of 
vtkImageData. This is the case if you put
the axis in an increasing order.
You can correct this by placing a fabs set on tolerance variable
108c108
< double tolerance = fabs(0.01*this->Spacing);
---
 > double tolerance = 0.01*this->Spacing;
- Test on units should be case independant
line 133, units.find(" since ")
I have netCDF files where "since" is typed with uppercase (generated by 
ferret software from the NOAA/PMEL).

Spherical coordinates should be possible in any case (regular spacing or 
not), even with a 2D variable where
height is 0 because field is at surface.
User choices for zorigin and zscale should be taken in consideration . 
Both set to 1 by default.
In addition, a user choice zpositive to tell the direction in which the 
coordinate values are increasing
should also be proposed. With allowed values : up or down (up by default).
Perhaps also a zorder choice to treat files where zdimension has to be 
reordered to get k=1 representing
surface.

There is also the problem of connectivity and blank cells (and Z 
clipping range - in spherical coordinates you
don't want to see the globe when missing cells exist).
Plus, the fact that CF conventions covers also curvilinear grids where 
longitudes and latitudes
are described with a 2D arrays. This is why I haved used a vtkPolydata 
structure (with limitation
that the application was not really to visualize 3D field, only 2D 
fields in a 3D mapping when
projection uses spherical coordinates.

Thanks for reading.

Take a look at VTK/Utilities/kwsys/SystemTools.hxx.in and
RegularExpression.hxx. SystemTools::LowerCase is a routine to downcase
strings and RegularExpression lets you define searches. To use them, you
need to
#include <vtksys/SystemTools.hxx>
#include <vtksys/RegularExpression.hxx>
Note that the includes use vtksys, not kwsys.

Hi,

I am trying to compile Paraview 3.6.2 on my laptop. Unfortunately I get 
this error:

I am using:

Note that with more or less the same configuration I was successful 
compiling it on a Workstation with Debian Lenny.

Any idea on what is wrong?

I attach my CMakeCache.txt file.

Thank you.

We actually have native support for octree datasets - try Sources ->
Octree Fractal.
There has been very little use of this dataset and I found that the
reader/writer for
it are not enabled. If you are willing to compile ParaView from
source, I can make
the necessary changes to our development version. Let me know.

This is the way the slice filter works - it creates triangles rather
than quads. I believe
that there is a filter, somewhere, that generates quads for the case
of (structured
data, planar slice). I'll ask the author of that filter its status.

Hi,

I'm trying to visualize a *.vti file containing some CellData and I get the
usual:
"Cannot volume render since no point (or cell)data available." which is
incorrect.
Furthermore, it seems that contouring is also disabled with CellData.

Is there a way to perform Volume and Contour visualization in that case?
If not, will this option be available in the next release?

Many thanks in advance for your help.

Ken,

Here is a dataset that I am able to reproduce with:
http://nashi-submaster.ucsd.edu/movies/PV/holes.tar.gz

run with 96 procs. Set the view to +y. If the long holes aren't 
appearing in your view I found that smaller holes can show up by 
rotating the plane in small increments about either the x or z axis. 
These ones are pretty small so you have to look closely.

Hi all,


Thanks so much for your help guys. As far as Ivo noted I tried the extract
cells by region filter and that seems to do the work, only the cells are in
3D - which kinda make sense because my original data is 3D.

As a matter of fact I have been able to import my Octree mesh and data into
Paraview using existing datasets (right now I am using Unstructured) and
other than the problem with slicing, everything else seems to work fine so
right now I think I am not in urgent need of native Octree support.

I also tried looking for filters that can create quad cells, but I couldn't
find it. I would greatly appreciate any help in finding such a filter.

Thanks,
Mohammad

Subject: [Paraview] Volume and Contour Vis with CellData ?

Message-ID: <C774BD54.16308%kmorel@sandia.gov>

It appears that the volume renderer does not support cell data, although that message is clearly misleading.  Perhaps someone who knows more about the volume renderer could elaborate.

The contour filter does not work with cell data because a contour is a bit ill defined for cell data (which has no explicit interpolation of data).  You will have to convert to point data somehow before the contour filter will work.

Hi,

I'm trying to visualize a *.vti file containing some CellData and I get the usual:
"Cannot volume render since no point (or cell)data available." which is incorrect.
Furthermore, it seems that contouring is also disabled with CellData.

Is there a way to perform Volume and Contour visualization in that case?
If not, will this option be available in the next release?

Many thanks in advance for your help.

I'm having some trouble getting ParaView 3.6.2 to compile on
Solaris 10/x86.

Is this the right list to ask about that, or should I ask on
the paraview-developers list?

Thanks,

Message-ID: <768CE9F7-E8B3-459B-89BC-AA621C1567EA@cs.duke.edu>

Hello,

I've never tried to package PV binaries before, but I've been enjoying exploring the new branding capabilities and started trying to see if I could package my custom PV to supply for my users. I added the appropriate lines to my CMakeList.txt file by looking at the one for the Spreadsheet app. I'm building out of the PV source tree, and the build goes fine.

Even though there were cpack options when configuring in ccmake for both binary and source packaging, I can run "make package_source" after my build but there is no target for "make package". Is there some other configuration I can do to package the binaries without all of the source files?

(I'm building 64-bit versions with CVS CMake and ParaView, and Qt 4.6.0 on both Mac OS X 10.6.2 and Ubuntu 9.10)

Thanks for the help,
-Eric

Eric,

That's something that needs to be fixed. For now, you can do this:

cpack -G TGZ --config CPack{PackageName}Config.cmake

You can change the generator (-G) suitable for your platform. Look at
cpack --help for details.

Note: this is still under development. I committed this code just
yesterday :), so there may be issues. But we'd love any feedback that
we can get.

Message-ID: <E4CACFCA-72E0-4344-B818-247834DFACF3@bluequartz.net>

I have an algorithm that needs to take 3 inputs. All three will be  
vtkImageData objects using Floating point values. I was wondering,  
before I even start anything, does the first data set in the pipeline  
have to be a composite data set so if I apply the filter I can assign  
specific "pieces" of the composite data set as inputs to the filter I  
am designing? What would be an example of a filter that takes multiple  
inputs that I could look at as an example?

Thanks for any help.

Hey Utkarsh,

Thanks for the quick response -- that worked perfectly for generating the package.

The problem I'm running into now, on Ubuntu at least (which is probably a generic install/package problem, not specific to the branding) is that the executable can't find the proper libraries. I can run from the {package}/build directory if I make a source package, but that seems to be because it's still finding the libraries in my original ParaView build -- ldd on the executable lists the original library build location, not the new {package}/lib/paraview-3.7 library location. I tried building ParaView with VTK_USE_RPATH turned OFF, too, but that didn't seem to solve it.

Sorry for the ignorance on this part -- I usually just build and run in place rather than doing an "install".

Thanks again,
-Eric

Eric,

I've updated the Wiki:

http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Writing_Custom_Applications#Packaging

Here are the highlights:
* Build ParaView with VTK_USE_RPATH:OFF and BUILD_SHARED: ON
* Build your app with CMAKE_SKIP_RPATH:ON and BUILD_SHARED: ON

I can run from the {package}/build directory if I make a source package, but that seems to be because it's still finding the libraries in my original ParaView build -- ldd on the executable lists the original library build location, not the new {package}/lib/paraview-3.7 library location. I tried building ParaView with VTK_USE_RPATH turned OFF, too, but that didn't seem to solve it.

I'm not sure vtkImageData (and everything that uses it) really supports
negative spacing.  See, for example, this email thread:
http://www.vtk.org/pipermail/vtkusers/2009-May/100989.html.

That is easy enough to change.

Yup.  I already made those changes.

I am confused here.  Where are zorigin and zscale defined?  I do not see any
mention of them in the CF or COARDS specifications.

Of course I have noticed this.  I have left it this way because it is not
clear what the right solution is.  There are two issues to closing the grid.
The first is that the CF/COARDS convention does not really specify whether
the grid is actually supposed to be closed.  It is perfectly valid to have
an open sphere (in fact common in the latitudinal dimension).  Of course, a
simple check of the distance between the two should clear that up.  Or
perhaps looking at the bounds of the data.

The second issue is one of connectivity.  More on that below.

Uh, isn't this the only way to define curvilinear grids in CF?  It is
already supported by the netCDF reader.

Oh.  I see why you proposed using poly data now.  I still don't think this
is feasible because of the 3D grid issue.  However, we could change the
netCDF reader to generate a structured grid that would be spatially closed
but not topologically closed.  If you needed the data to be topologically
closed, you could always run the clean to grid filter, which would convert
it to an unstructured grid that would support such topology and remove the
duplicated points.

So you are right these are artifacts not holes. Nasty looking ones at 
that. zooming in enough makes the artifacts receded toward the egdes of 
the tube. After some experimentation I'm finding that this has something 
to do with mesa. It is reproducible only when using mesa. Hardware 
rendering works fine, no artifacts.

There also looks to be two things going on, 1) the artifacts, 2) 
inconsistent selection of the visible faces on parallel runs.  This is 
shown here: 
http://nashi-submaster.ucsd.edu/movies/PV/tube-filter-artifact/decomp-8-procs.png

I was using PV on this cluster fine back in dec to make very similar 
figures with stream tubes and didn't see any of these issues...

I added the dataset to reproduce to the bug report.

> Whats the trouble?

Okay, let me see. I've been trying various things for a while, so I 
apologize if this gets muddled.

I am using: Solaris 10/x86. I have both SunStudio 12.1 and /usr/bin/sfw/gcc
(version 3.4.3). I installed cmake 2.8.0 from source.

I first tried using my normal build environment, but it's kind of a mess right now,
I guess. I finally followed the advice at http://www.latp.univ-mrs.fr/informatique/doku.php?id=paraview
and installed the CBE packages (but not their cmake, since it's older). I'm now building in
a shell invoked using:

/opt/dtbld/bin/env.sh gcc3

This clears out any random cruft in one's environment, which seems to help with configuration.

I have also rebuilt qt-4.5.3 inside this environment with gcc, since my normal qt doesn't seem to 
link correctly either. (That was kind of a mess, but worked for other things. For whatever
reason libCrun didn't get linked in, and thus libQtGui didn't get linked, and all the stuff 
that depends on it would throw errors. I think I won't go into that right now. If you're curious
I could probably duplicate those issues.)

So, here are the main problems I ran into:

1. Something in Solaris #defines GS to 0, so I had to edit
VTK/Graphics/vtkDataObjectGenerator.cxx and put #undef GS right under
#include "vtkDataObjectGenerator.h". That looks like this:

[ 15%] Building CXX object VTK/Graphics/CMakeFiles/vtkGraphics.dir/vtkDataObjectGenerator.o
/home/software/Solaris_10/courseware/paraview/ParaView3/VTK/Graphics/vtkDataObjectGenerator.cxx:52: error: expected identifier before numeric constant

make[1]: *** [VTK/Graphics/CMakeFiles/vtkGraphics.dir/all] Error 2
make: *** [all] Error 2

That points to this:

---snip
//============================================================================
enum vtkDataObjectGeneratorTokenCodes
  {
  ID1, UF1, RG1, SG1, PD1, UG1, GS, GE, HBS, HBE, MBS, MBE, NUMTOKENS
  };
---snip

...and if you run that file through cpp, you get 0 in place of GS. I haven't
tracked down the source of the original GS yet. 

2. In my current build, cmake doesn't seem to automatically know to include 
"-lnsl -lsocket" when it needs to. For example:

[ 30%] Building CXX object VTK/Filtering/Testing/Cxx/CMakeFiles/FilteringCxxTests.dir/TestTriangle.o

make: *** [all] Error 2

I'm not sure which of the config variables that needs to be added to in ccmake. For this build I
added it to the link.txt files by hand rather than rerunning the ccmake configuration.

3. Also, I get lots of this kind of warning, which at least doesn't stop the build:

Linking CXX shared library ../../../bin/libvtkViewsCS.so
ld: warning: file /usr/local/lib/libXrender.so: attempted multiple inclusion of file
ld: warning: file /usr/local/lib/libfreetype.so: attempted multiple inclusion of file

ld: warning: file ../../../bin/libvtkFilteringCS.so: attempted multiple inclusion of file
ld: warning: file ../../../bin/libvtkClientServer.so: attempted multiple inclusion of file

This seems to happen for most of the shared libraries. It doesn't hurt anything, but it
seems to imply that something isn't being configured correctly. 

4. Sun's /usr/bin/tar also isn't compatible with gnu tar, leading to this:

-- Installing /usr/local/lib/paraview-3.6/libQtCore.so
tar: C: unknown function modifier
Usage: tar {c|r|t|u|x}[BDeEFhilmnopPqTvw@[0-7]][bfk][X...] [blocksize] [tarfile] [size] [exclude-file...] {file | -I include-file | -C directory file}...
[...]

It might be nice if it detected that, or if there were a place to set the path
to a gnu-compatible tar. On Solaris 10, gnu tar is in /usr/sfw/bin/gtar. 

I did finally get it built today, but it was a pretty painful process. I could have
saved a lot of trouble by starting with the clean build environment, but I've never
run into these kinds of problems with any other software packages.

I am pretty sure that mapper supports cell data. The problem is probably in the
ParaView logic somewhere...

So I thought there is such a filter already in paraview

Subject: [Paraview] showing all points of a structured dataset
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.1001150838370.6950@pixel.toothycat.net>

Hi,

I've got a 3x3x3 set of points, and am trying to show all of the points 
individually. My VTK file looks like

# vtk DataFile Version 2.0
Volume example
ASCII
DATASET STRUCTURED_POINTS
DIMENSIONS 3 3 3
ASPECT_RATIO 1 1 1
ORIGIN 0 0 0
POINT_DATA 27
SCALARS volume_scalars char 1
LOOKUP_TABLE default
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0


When I set 'Representation' under 'Display' to points, the point at the centre 
is missed out. In fact, for any 3d dataset of structured points I have tried, 
the interior points are missed out.

The points look like they are there, since 'Information' tells me there are 27 
points.

Any ideas how I can see all the points?

Thanks,

Nagi

One possible idea would be:

Filters -> Alphabetical -> Glyphs

Subject: [Paraview] Cpack and ParaView3.6.2-rc1
Message-ID: <02e101ca95d0$74af6b70$4f2810ac@win.ara>

Dear All,

I've still not resolved the issues I've been having with compiling external
filters (not just VTKEdge, although I haven't tried rev. 832 yet) with the
release version of ParaView 3.6.2. Oddly, the problem appears to lie just
with those that use external netCDF libraries and only the SM plugin is
rejected as invalid Qt plugin (they compile fine). 

So, I've reverted back to the release candidate for the near future until I
resolve these other problems. Unfortunately, when I try to use cpack to
produce a tarball, it is giving me errors relating to RPATH commands. See
below:

CMake Error: Error in cmake code at
/Paraview/ParaView3.6.2-RC1/Servers/Common/cmake_install.cmake:59:
FILE does not recognize sub-command RPATH_REMOVE
Current CMake stack:
[3]     /Paraview/ParaView3.6.2-RC1/Servers/Common/cmake_install.cmake
[2]     /Paraview/ParaView3.6.2-RC1/Servers/cmake_install.cmake
[1]     /Paraview/ParaView3.6.2-RC1/cmake_install.cmake
CMake Error: Error in cmake code at
/Paraview/ParaView3.6.2-RC1/Servers/Common/cmake_install.cmake:83:

Current CMake stack:

[2]     /Paraview/ParaView3.6.2-RC1/Servers/cmake_install.cmake
[1]     /Paraview/ParaView3.6.2-RC1/cmake_install.cmake

There are many more like this. I was able to compile and cpack the release
version into a tarball without any issues. From comparing the
cmake_install.cmake files of both the versions, the release version doesn't
appear to have the RPATH commands. I tried disabling the VTK_USE_RPATH for
development versions but I still seem to get the same issues.

Maybe this is something you have come across before and found a solution to?

Adriano

Hi,
the same happens if you want to visualize an vtkImageData as "points" or
"surface". Only the outer topological entities are displayed, because of the
mapper internal functionning. See thread "unstructured grid + tetrahedrons"
in the vtk-users mailing list.

In a nutshell, the outer geometrical entities are considered as vertices by
the mapper. Using a glyph filter before visualization with a 2D glyph
(Vertex type) will attached a topological 0D entity (vertex) to all the
geometrical entities (points). Attached is an example of 12^3 volume with 2
different visualizations: left is the volume fitlered through a glyph filter
with vertex type, right is "Style->Representation->Points".

Dear All,

I've managed to get cpack working. I don't know what I did before, but
disabling the VTK_USE_RPATH flag remove the RPATH errors worked this time.
Also, I was receiving a FILES_MATCHING not found error, but removing this
piece of code from Applications/Client/CMakeLists.txt (I believe it
attempted to link sql libs to Qt Libs. We don't require it and it wasn't
present in the equivalent release CMakeLists.txt) means it cpack's fine now.
However, when extracting the tarball the libQtWebKit.* shared libs appear to
be missing, although this isn't a major problem. When they are replaced,
everything works as expected. Much ado about nothing, really!

Hey Utkarsh,

We're getting closer... Your new instructions got me past a lot of the problems, but I was still missing the Qt libraries. I copied the "Add install rules..." section from Applications/ParaView/CMakeLists.txt so I would have an example for the install_qt_libs() macro, and it sort of worked, but in my binary package it put all of the Qt libraries in the package root rather than in {package_root}/lib/paraview-3.7/. After I moved the Qt libraries to that spot, all it was missing was libaudio.so.2 (which is a link to libaudio.so.2.4 on my system). If I also copy that to the correct package lib directory it runs on a clean Ubuntu system!

So, if you know how to get the Qt libraries to end up in the correct spot, and how to get libaudio to show up, too, let me know.

Oh, and when I copied the whole "Add install rules" section, cmake complained when it ran into the "Install the .plugins configuration file" section, saying "install FILES given no DESTINATION!". I guess maybe it doesn't know the ${PV_INSTALL_LIB_DIR} variable, but I'm not sure if I'll need that, or what to replace it with in my script.

Next I need to see if I can get my plugins to compile and install along with my branded app. As you can tell, I'm not exactly a CMake master! :)

Thanks again for all the help,
-Eric

Eric,

If your application wants to install Qt libs, use the following:

#-------------------------------------------------------------------
SET (qtliblist QTCORE QTGUI QTNETWORK QTXML QTSQL QTHELP QTWEBKIT
QTCLUCENE PHONON QTXMLPATTERNS)
# QTDBUS is Unix only
IF(NOT WIN32)
  LIST(APPEND qtliblist QTDBUS)
ENDIF(NOT WIN32)

IF (NOT WIN32)
  SET (PV_INSTALL_LIB_DIR
"lib/paraview-${PARAVIEW_VERSION_MAJOR}.${PARAVIEW_VERSION_MINOR}")
ELSE (NOT WIN32)
  SET (PV_INSTALL_LIB_DIR "bin")
ENDIF (NOT WIN32)

# You can set PV_INSTALL_LIB_DIR to "lib/yourapp-version" if you want
to put the qt libraries there.

install_qt_libs("${qtliblist}" BrandedRuntime)
#-------------------------------------------------------------------

I think I may change install_qt_libs to take the location where to
install them so that you don't have set the PV_INSTALL_LIB_DIR
variable.

Don't copy the install rule for .plugins since that doesn't make sense
for custom applications.

I am pondering creating a new install component "ThirdPartyRuntimes"
that the custom app can pick to install and then Qt and FFMPEG (if
applicable) will get installed automatically.

Ah I think I know why your QT libs are not in the right spot. That being the
FUNCTION(install_qt_libs qtliblist componentname) Macro in
ParaViewBrandingCPack.cmake is using ${PV_INSTALL_LIB_DIR} which probably
isn't defined in your case. We'll get this fixed up.

Subject: [Paraview] XDMF questions...
Message-ID: <4B509B00.3060905@gmail.com>

Hi,

   I have a custom unstructured grid and solution file that is in HDF5. 
  I was looking into reading this into ParaView and was planning on 
using XDMF for this purpose.  However, I have run into certain issues 
which I am not sure how to address and hence this plea for help:

(1) I have the connectivity maps for the various element types as 
separate chunks in the HDF file, i.e., the Tetrahedra connectivity is 
stored separately from the Wedge connectivity etc.  This leads to a 
problem with the Topology specification as I can have only one Topology 
section per Grid.  If I set the Topology type to Mixed, then I have to 
re-encode my connectivity data (something I would prefer not to do).  Is 
there any way to read this data given these constraints?

(2) I did not see any support for specifying boundary "tags", i.e., an 
integer identifier for boundary faces (triangles and quads in 3D) such 
that I can display only a specified surface or a list of surfaces as 
needed.  Am I missing something or is this feature not available?

(3) I have the dependent variable vector (consists of a combination of 
scalars and vectors) that is written out as a single entity and not as 
individual scalars and vectors.  Is there an easy way to make XDMF read it?

Thanks for your help,

Sree

the parallel inconsistency, and removed the older images.

Subject: [Paraview] Design of Multiple Input Filter
In-Reply-To: <E4CACFCA-72E0-4344-B818-247834DFACF3@bluequartz.net>

It doesn't have to be be a composite data algorithm or operate on 
composite data. There are two options available without delving into 
composite data, 1) make multiple inputs, 2)  make a single input repeatable.


in option 1)

    class vtkMyFilter : public vtkImageDataAlgorithm
    {
    ...
    };

    vtkMyFilter::vtkMyFilter()
    {
    ...
    this->SetNumberOfInputPorts(3);
    }


or in option 2)

    class vtkMyFilter : public vtkImageDataAlgorithm
    {
    ...
    };

    vtkMyFilter::vtkMyFilter()
    {
    ...
    this->SetNumberOfInputPorts(1);
    }

    int vtkMyFilter::FillInputPortInformation(int port, vtkInformation
    *info)
    {
    ...
    info->Set(vtkAlgorithm::INPUT_REQUIRED_DATA_TYPE(), "vtkImageData");
    info->Set(vtkAlgorithm::INPUT_IS_REPEATABLE(),1);
    }

during request data in option 1) you get a vector of information objects 
each with one dataset, in 2) you get a vector of datasets in one 
information object. The UI differs in the way the inputs are selected, 
option 1) will be more clear that 3 are required.

This is explained (much better) in the user guide along with composite 
data algorithm.

Using the dataset below I can reproduce the issue on my workstation 
using 4 processes and both hardware and mesa rendering.

great. Thanks. I actually have the ParaView User Guide for ParaView 3,  
could you point me in the general vicinity in the user guide where  
this is explained? The index wasn't much help but I am probably not  
looking up the correct terms.

Thanks

woops my bad! I guess I was thinking of chapter 11 & 13 in the VTK user 
guide...

Thanks, that gets the Qt libraries in the proper place.

If you created a ThirdPartyRuntimes component would that automatically pick up dependencies like the libaudio? 

The Ubuntu I'm using has only been used to build ParaView CVS from source, and so the only non-standard apt-get installs I've done before building PV were based on the list for Debian on the PV Wiki: cvs libphonon-dev libphonon4 libqt4-assistant qt4-dev-tools libqt4-core libqt4-gui qt4-qmake libxt-dev g++ gcc cmake-curses-gui libqt4-opengl-dev openmpi-common openmpi-bin libopenmpi-dev python2.6-dev

But, it would be great if my binary package could run on a "clean" system since I don't know what my users will have installed. I guess if I knew where libaudio came in, I could have them install that package, but it would be cleaner if I didn't have to...

I'll send a separate email with my OS X issues... Something for you to look forward to. :)

Thanks,
-Eric

Sree,

1) Make each separate Topology a separate Grid. Then encapsulate
all the grids into a collection :
	<Grid GridType="Collection" CollectionType="Spatial" ..
           <Grid
           <Grid
2)Use XdmfSet :

         <Set Name="Ids" SetType="Node" SetLength="4">
             <DataItem Format="XML" Dimensions="4" >
                 1 2 3 4
             </DataItem>
             <Attribute Name="Force" Center="Node">
                 <DataItem Format="XML" Dimensions="4" >
                     100.0 110.0 100.0 200.0
                 </DataItem>
             </Attribute>
         </Set>
3)No not really. You could use a nested <DataItem> of type="Coordinates"
but that would be messy and slow.

Hey Utkarsh,

Am I pushing on the branding packaging a bit too soon? I had forgotten the exchanges of last month with the "cpack not adapted yet to branding commit?" thread. 

I'm excited that it's getting so easy to supply my users with a customized version of PV, but I can wait on this a bit if you're still working on the install/packaging stuff.

Thanks,
-Eric

On the contrary, now would be good time to highlight any issues you
run into, since it's still fresh and under development, but you'll
have to bear with us since it's under development :) and not robustly
tested.

Jerry,

    Thanks for the quick answer.  I had a follow up question:  When I 
used what you suggested in (1) below, I found that I had to repeat the 
Geometry section for each of grids in the collection.  How is this 
handled memory wise?  Is each of the subgrids going to have a copy of 
all the coordinates in the grid?  If that is the case, then we are 
really inefficient.  An alternative would be to allow a Grid to have 
multiple Topology sections, that way I can do what I want without having 
to repeat things.

    I have not tried (2) yet; will keep you posted on how that works.

Hello, 

Is there away to configure the client to accept reverse connections from the entire IP range of a cluster? That is, I don't know which node on the cluster will be assigned the job ahead of time so I don't know what to put in for Host in the Configure New Server dialogue. As opposed to having to add a new server every time a I get assigned a new node.

Thanks,
Mark

Message-ID: <119955.75768.qm@web24202.mail.ird.yahoo.com>

Dear all,

I want to extract certain zones (using name filtering) from an Ensight MultiBlock Reader.
Currently I have the names of the zones to extract in a Python list. I do not know how to proceed. I guess I need to get the IDs of these zones? How to do that? How to extract the zones?
I am working with Paraview 3.6.2 and the Trace did not help me much for this. Where do I get some more documentation than in the wiki? Thanks.

Regards BastiL

I agree. And that's why I have added the function fabs to make positive the
tolerance variable.

 From ParaView3/VTK/IO/vtkNetCDFCOARDSReader.cxx (line 105...)
    this->Spacing
      = (this->Coordinates->GetValue(dimLen-1) - this->Origin)/(dimLen-1);
    this->HasRegularSpacing = true;     // Then check to see if it is false.
    double tolerance = 0.01*this->Spacing;
    for (size_t i = 1; i < dimLen; i++)
      {
      double expectedValue = this->Origin + i*this->Spacing;
      double actualValue = this->Coordinates->GetValue(i);
      if (   (actualValue < expectedValue-tolerance)
          || (actualValue > expectedValue+tolerance) )
        {
        this->HasRegularSpacing = false;
        fprintf(stderr,"HasRegularSpacing = false");
        break;
        }
      }

As I have written, if a coordinate variable goes from 90 to -90 
(decreasing) with dimLen=7
(-90, -60, -30, 0, 30, 60, 90)
then Spacing variable is (-90 -90)/6 = -30 so negative, as tolerance 
value equals to -0.3
expectedValue for i equals  90 +30 = 120 instead of 60 !
Consequence you get a "HasRegularSpacing = false"  whereas the grid is 
regular.
Put a simple fabs solves the problem
double tolerance = fabs(0.01*this->Spacing);
Is it clearer ?

Do you mean that the user have to change it by himself using ncrename 
(netcdf operators).
I hope not and I consider that it should be treated within the reader. A 
user does not care
about a typology of an attribut.
Having said that, I don't know how to lowercase a vtkStdString.

Indeed CF or COARDS conventions are not concerned by the projection made 
from a lon,lat grid.
But define a height variable as follows
    height = zorigin + fabs(zpositive) * zscale * heightCoords->GetValue(k)
    (with zorigin, zorigin, zscale = 1 by default)
would be better than simply define it as
    height = heightCoords->GetValue(k)
because heightCoords can be negative, have to be scaled, can be equal to 
0 (surface).

The modulo aspect concerns longitude, not latitude.
In the COARDS convention, one can consider that the bounds of each cell 
is defined at the middle
of 2 center cells.
 From a coordinate variable as follows
lon(imt)= {30, 90, 150, 210, 270, 330}
we can calculate its boundaries
bounds_lon(imt,2) = {0,60, 60,120, 120,180, 180,240, 240,300, 300,360}

There is a modulo longitude to set if first lower cell equals to last 
upper cell (use cosinus).
Here cos(0)=cos(360) so the grid is modulo and the vtkStructuredGrid has 
to be
topologically closed

Not sure of that.
Try from the example file:
http://dods.ipsl.jussieu.fr/prism/gridsCF/sampleCurveGrid4.nc
I get a vtkImageData that represents only the array not its lonlat 
representation.

However, this what I have done in the python/vtk application
http://www.prism.enes.org/Publications/Reports/Report19.pdf
It uses a vtkPolyData with points defined from the boundaries of each cell.
Either explicitely found from bounds attributs or deducted from middle of
2 center cells.
And indeed a vtkCleanPolyData() filter was passed after creation to get a
clean grid without redondancies.

First goal for me is to get a vtkNetCDFCOARDSReader.cxx working
for grid as defined in the COARDS convention ie a coordinate
variable describes a 1D vector where bounds are at the middle of 2 points.

Subject: [Paraview] Memory leak in Paraview 3.6.1(?)
Message-ID: <4B515E10.8060906@web.de>

This issue persists in Paraview 3.6.2, with which I've just viewed a 
relatively small data set (one polysphere and about a 40 line segments). 
However, after disconnecting the server, thereby unloading the data, 
Paraview's memory consumption remains at 103Mb -- that's not right. Why 
isn't Paraview releasing memory from purged objects. If it matters, the 
objects were imported using a python script.

Hello

I don't understand this sentence "Under the terms of Contract
DE-AC04-94AL85000,
there is a non-exclusive license for use of this work by or on behalf of the
U.S. Government"
in Paraview License Version 1.2.

What does it mean exactly ?

That means that the US government entities can use the referred work without
any restrictions. Not relevant to anyone else. Not too relevant to the
government
either since the code is BSD licensed. Note that this does not extend to any
improvements or fixes made by others unless they contribute it back to

Sorry for the misunderstanding. That filter is not in ParaView. I will inquire
if it is mature enough to put in ParaView.

Subject: [Paraview] How to pick a point and get it in a plugin?
Message-ID: <BAY109-W415D23D40F27D9C086086CB2680@phx.gbl>


I would like to use the picking functionnality, ie pick a point of a surface, and get it in my plugin, for instance to compute a streamline.
StreamTracer offers this functionnality but it actually does not work because the pick point is not necessary a point of the dataset, as with the picking functionnality when "select points on" is selected. Thus, in case of a surface, the point does not lie on the surface ad no streamline is computed (I mean with StreamTracer).
So my question is: is it possible to pick a point of a surface with the "select points on" functionnality and get it back in my filter, connected to the SetOrigin(double [3]) function for instance?

Hi Mark,

This is an issue with the GUI. The client doesn't really care who is
connecting - it accepts from any IP. The host field in the GUI is
irrelevant.

Hi Ken,
could you please give some information about using macros in new Python
shell (ParaView 3.6.2)?
If we check View -> Tollbars -> Macro Toolbar we can't see any new icon on
the toolbar; if we check "Show menu" in the "Macros" tab inside Python
shell, we can see the new menu "Macros", but it is empty.

(The link http://www.itk.org/Wiki/Python_GUI_Tools#Macros didn't give any
information...)


Thank you very much

Message-ID: <201001181457.25512.martin.genet@lmt.ens-cachan.fr>

Dear Paraview's list,

I was looking for an option to rescale the data range at each frame of an animation. In the mailing list archives, I have found an exchange about this, where "Ken" asked:

> Furthermore, the result could be highly misleading. The constantly rescaled colors would show shifts of the scalar over time that simply do not exist. Do you have some use case in which these concerns do not apply?

And I do have a very simple one: in my non linear calculations, I want to emphasize the way the evolving internal variables modify the shape of some field of interest, independently of the field intensity evolution.

I hope I am clear enough.

Anyway, many thanks for all the work.

Cheers,

Martin.

This has now been fixed in  CVS. The GUI will no longer ask for a
hostname when configuring a reverse connection.

Message-ID: <441339.87227.qm@web110114.mail.gq1.yahoo.com>

Hi,

I'm trying to export a mesh generated in ICEM CFD to ParaView. I realized that I can export the mesh to Exodus II format and then open it with ParaView, but no information about the parts of the mesh is loaded, just the blocks. 

Any reader available to export geometry and mesh from ICEM CFD to ParaView ? I would like that the MultiBlockDataSet generated as result have information about the parts created in ICEM CFD.

Regards,
Rafael March.

Today after a CVS update, I'm getting the following error messages (lots of, but here's one example)

Question : Is linking one plugin to another plugin forbidden now? 
Setting CMAKE_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY to 2.2 didn't seem to make any difference, errors persist. I will keep trying.

thanks

If I go to Tools->manage plugins and load a plugin, although it says
"Loaded" under "Property" in the "Local Plugins" list, it does not
appear in the filters list. However, if I check "auto load" and then
restart Paraview, it appears in the list.

Is this a bug?

This is fairly easy to do if you're using python.

You could start off your time series with something like:
<contacts/ui/ContactManager?js=RAW&maximize=true&hide=true&position=absolute&hl=en&emailsLink=true&sk=true&titleBar=false&border=NONE&eventCallback=ParentStub1263830196859&zx=9qx28f80odc0#>
Show(someFilter)
dpsF = GetDisplayProperties(someFilter)
dpsF.ColorArrayName = 'someArray'
dpsF.LookupTable = MakeBlueToRedLT(lowValue,highValue)

and then each timestep you could update:

dpsF.LookupTable = MakeBlueToRedLT(newLowValue,newHighValue)

I'm not sure how you would do it through the GUI.

Good luck,

Peter.

Try going to View -> Toolbars and clicking on "Macro Toolbar."

This is a brand new feature, so we are still flushing out the functionality and documentation.

If I use the "select points on" tool, I can select a point, then
release the mouse, hold control, select the "select points on" tool
again, select another point, and they will now both be in the
selection.

However, if I try to do this with the "select points through" tool,
the selection is simply replaced instead of appended.

Is this the expected behavior?

Looking at the mesa-artifacts-decomp.png image, it appears that you have many tubes that are coincident (or at least close to coincident).  There might be z-buffer resolution problems.  What happens if you run the geometry through D3?

Selection * Through does not support appending to the selection. It's
a known limitation.

Message-ID: <c19fcadc1001180931l7b36e1c5t29e82a0c3196816f@mail.gmail.com>

If I select 3 points and then use the ExtractSelection filter, I would
expect the IDs of the points to be 0,1,2, in the order selected.
Instead, they are 2, 0, 1.

Is there any way to prevent this? I am trying to set corresponding
landmarks, so the order is important, and it is being lost.

Thanks,

plugin work for you?

Is it reproducible without using Python for creating the objects?
Easiest way to try that is create the objects using python, then save
the state out, then restart paraview and load the state file to create
the objects.

Hm, I tried another one and it worked as expected.

This is the one that doesn't work:
http://www.rpi.edu/~doriad/Paraview_List/ICP/

It doesn't seem like there is anything wrong with the code though
because after some monkeying around (disabling/enabling a few times
and restarting paraview) it works as expected.

Does anything jump out at you?

Thanks,

David

I cannot reproduce this issue. Are you still getting the problem? Is
this is clean build?

Subject: [Paraview] tube filter, surfaces aren't closed?

I'm guessing that this is a z-buffer precision issue.  The nVidia card must be using a higher precision z-buffer or doing something else that is preventing the z-fighting that appears to be happening in the Mesa implementation.

Yes, that is the case. There are 200 lines , each a single cell , and 
the pvtp reader splits them up fairly evenly amongst processes to begin

I can't find anything wrong other then there must be some sort of precision issue that is interfering with the decision of when to draw a polygon that is smaller than a pixel.  I just checked in a change to IceT that prevents shifting around the projection matrix in single-display mode.  That should fix the problem.

No.  I already understand that if the tolerance gets a negative value, the
HasRegularSpacing check will fail even if the spacing really is regular.
And I understand how using abs will fix that.

My point is that if the spacing is negative, then you cannot use a
vtkImageData because vtkImageData does not support negative spacing.  And
the only reason for the HasRegularSpacing check is there in the first place
is to decide whether to use a vtkImageData.

So, the code would be clearer if there was a statement like
if(this->Spacing<=0.0) { skip HasRegularSpacing check and use
vtkRectilinearGrid instead of vtkImagedata }.  But regardless, the code ends
up doing the right thing even if technically HasRegularSpacing is set to
false instead of true.

I mean it is an easy fix in the code.  I checked in a fix this morning.

Consider an arbitrary surface with tangent vectors defined on it. How do you do for computing streamlines on such a surface? I mean how do you place seed points? Placing seeds on a shere or on a line does not work since of course seed points are not on the surface.

Try using "Stream Tracer With Custom Source", and passing an extract
selection from the surface as the seed input. There are some caveats
to this if working in parallel.

Hi,

I'm trying to export a mesh generated in ICEM CFD to ParaView. I realized
that I can export the mesh to Exodus II format and then open it with
ParaView, but no information about the parts of the mesh is loaded, just the
blocks.

Any reader available to export geometry and mesh from ICEM CFD to ParaView ?
I would like that the MultiBlockDataSet generated as result have information
about the parts created in ICEM CFD.

Regards,
Castaneda.

Writing it as a Fluent mesh might work, but haven't tried it myself.

Dear Everybody !
 
I read the mail on FAQ from 22.Maya 2009 satating that tiled display

Out of curiosity, what is the difference between parts and blocks? Or
are you using them
interchangeably?

Hi,

thanks for answering. I've programmed a plugin for CFD preprocessing
purposes (I mean, setting boundary and initial conditions, solver parameters
and so on) and I would like that a user could make a model+mesh in ICEM CFD
and export it to ParaView. When using ICEM CFD, one usually creates parts,
which are grouping of 2D geometric entities, so that one can distinguish
between different regions to attribute different BC's or IC's. The user also
must create a domain, which is actually the 3D physical domain in which
there is a flow.

When I export to exodus II format, just the 3D Physical Domain is created as
a block in the Multiblock Dataset, the 2D geometric entities, the parts, are
not created. But I really need this information, so that I can distinguish
the parts of the Model in my plugin and allow the user to select them to
associate conditions. I tried exporting to fluent format in ICEM CFD, then
opening with Fluent, saving as .cas file (which ParaView can read), but
also: no information about the parts.

The question is: is there any format or reader, available in VTK or ParaView
that is known to read ICEM CFD Meshes with ALL the information ? I'm pretty
sure someone somewhere already needed this !

Thanks a lot for your help,
Rafael Castaneda.

Are you sure that all the information exists in the output file from ICEM? I
know from past experience that when outputing a Plot3D file after using ICEM
Hexa that none of the boundary information was included. There is an output
format known as Multiblock-Info that should contain the information you want
(at least the boundary names on the faces), but I don't think ParaView can
read it in. I'd output the file formats you have tried again in ASCII format
and have a look to see if this information you are after is actually there.

Subject: [Paraview] Problems with WriteImage using pvpython
Message-ID: <9F1CE045430F4C7E85EF2B666EF86E24@win.ara>


I am coming across a weird problem. I'm attempting to use the WriteImage
paraview.simple command in batch mode. However, whenever I run the script it
gives me a segmentation fault; no other error appears. The same script runs
fine via the Python Shell. I am using ParaView version 3.6.2-RC1, which I'm
assuming isn't supported now. I'm just wondering if anyone else has seen
this behaviour before and whether they have a solution for it? Is it a
problem with the initial build? With the cpacking?

Adriano

Example Script:
filename="test.case"
data_reader = EnSightReader(CaseFileName=filename)
Show(data_reader)
WriteImage('test.png')

Output:
paraview version 3.7.0, Date: 2009-10-03
vtkGenericEnSightReader : [ ...........]
vtkPVGeometryFilter : [ ...........]
vtkPVCacheKeeper : [ ...........]
vtkPainterPolyDataMapper : [ ...........]

Subject: [Paraview] MultiBlock Dataset Naming Issues
Message-ID: <A24B572C-FCAC-4EAF-9E51-6424C6F5D960@bluequartz.net>

I have my MultiBlockDataset reader working nicely now. I have a custom  
panel that contains a tree view and I can select various selections  
from the tree and have "something" rendered in the 3D view. Awesome.  
Now, the problems.

When I click on the "Information" tab to see the list of datasets that  
were actually read (The Heirarchy Table) the list is correct. But when  
I click on one of the data sets and then look at the "Data Arrays"  
table the name that appears has a " (partial)" appended to it. Where  
is that coming from and what does it mean?

  Also, when I view the data as a "Surface" and then select one of the  
listed Arrays to "Color By" the rendered view just stays a solid  
color. Actually it looks like as long as I select the top most array  
to color by in the list, after the "Solid" and "vtkCompositeIndex"  
selections then I will get a proper rendering.

  So for example, say I tell my reader to read the following 3 data  
sets: Phi1, Phi, Phi2. This will result is a MultiBlockDataset with 3  
blocks. The "Color By" drop down will have the following:

Solid
vtkCompositeIndex
phi1
phi
phi2

If I select "phi1" the rendering is correct. If I select "phi" or  
"phi2" then I just get a solid color surface rendering.

  Anyone seen anything like this or possibly know what is going on? I  
can supply all the source codes and experimental data if that is needed.

Subject: [Paraview] VTK: Re(z), Im(z) plotted as |z|^2, arg(z) ?
Message-ID: <d933725a1001190839q2995b021vde23f49e651b04f2@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm having that very simple legacy VTK file (STRUCTURED_GRID) with one
big block of SCALARS with two components, representing the real part
and the imaginary part of complex values z.

The values that are interesting for plotting are |z|^2 and arg(z),
which of course can be entirely expressed in terms of Re(z), Im(z). Is
there any way to tell ParaView to do the conversion?

What I do right now is returning not Re(z), Im(z) in the VTK
components, but |z|^2 and arg(z), for which apparently a conversion in
the code's write and read routines is necessary (potentially leading
to round-off errors, and being inherently *ugly*).

Cheers,
Nico

Sorry to put this message up but I suspect there is a way to get the coords or point id of a point picked with "select point on" functionnality, so please may someone give me some hints?

Subject: [Paraview] How to pick a point and get it in a plugin?








I would like to use the picking functionnality, ie pick a point of a surface, and get it in my plugin, for instance to compute a streamline.
StreamTracer offers this functionnality but it actually does not work because the pick point is not necessary a point of the dataset, as with the picking functionnality when "select points on" is selected. Thus, in case of a surface, the point does not lie on the surface ad no streamline is computed (I mean with StreamTracer).
So my question is: is it possible to pick a point of a surface with the "select points on" functionnality and get it back in my filter, connected to the SetOrigin(double [3]) function for instance?

Can you use the array calculator filter to compute the derived values?

Here is a demo of the problem:

http://www.rpi.edu/~doriad/Paraview_List/ExtractSelection/

points.vtp contains 10 points, (0-9). I selected points 9, 8, 7, in that
order and extracted the selection. The result (extracted.vtp) has the 3
extracted points (corresponding to 9,8,7) ordered 2, 1, 0, rather than 0, 1,
2, which was the selection order.

Is this a bug or was the ordered never intended to be preserved?

Thanks,

David

Hey Utkarsh,

So, at this point the Ubuntu packaging is manageable for now. (libaudio is the only thing that seems to be required that doesn't get packaged.)

In moving on to the OS X packaging I'm having a few issues, some of which are probably just due to my ignorance:

1. The install_qt_libs() macro is only written for non-Apple -- is this because there is some problem doing similar things under OS X, or is there something else that handles this functionality? (I'm not getting any Qt libs in my OS X TGZ binary bundles.)

2. It's just a little thing, but the binary package is always labeled "...Darwin-i386.tar.gz" even if I've compiled for only x86_64.

3. If I make a standard TGZ binary package, the executable still refers (otool -L) to the libraries in the build directory. Maybe this is another issue with needing to compile ParaView with VTK_USE_RPATH: OFF and then my application with CMAKE_SKIP_RPATH: ON, but on OS X I couldn't build PV with RPATH OFF... (I can reproduce what happened, but I think it was a problem with vtkSocketCommunicator.cxx). Otherwise, maybe it's one of those things where more scripts need to be run afterwards to fix the library paths (install_tool...?), I'm just not sure how to do all of that since I've never prepared binaries for distribution.

4. To try making a drag-n-drop bundle, I blindly copied the CMakeList.txt section from {PV_source}/Applications/ParaView IF(APPLE)..., along with CompleteBundle.cmake.in and CreateBundle.sh.in from that directory. I had to add a few lines from OverView to get it to run the "cpack -G Bundle --config CPackParaView_MSIConfig.cmake" call:

  CONFIGURE_FILE("${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/Info.plist.in" "${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/Info.plist" @ONLY)
  SET(CPACK_BUNDLE_NAME "paraview_MSI")
  SET(CPACK_BUNDLE_PLIST "${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/Info.plist")
  SET(CPACK_BUNDLE_ICON "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/MSIsimIcon.icns")

The dmg is created, but the application bundle inside is not valid. I'll try to attach a screen shot of the directory structure, but basically instead of .app/Contents/MacOS/paraview it has .app/Contents/Resources/bin(&lib...)/paraview.app/Contents/MacOS/paraview.

Sorry about so much packed in one email, and thanks for all the help,
-Eric

PV expects each  block to have the same set of arrays, if an array is 
missing from one of the blocks then PV treats it as a partial array. Are 
you setting the same arrays in each block?

If you make your filter have two inputs, you might be able to use 
"select points on" and the "extract selection filter" as the second 
input. That will let you get point actually on the surface.

I am doing the following:

vtkImageData* imageData = ...
// Initialize output with the proper dimensions and other stuff
.....
// Set the Name of the Scalars
imageData->GetPointData()->GetScalars()->SetName(record- 
 >getRecordName().c_str());
imageData->GetPointData()->SetActiveScalars(record- 
 >getRecordName().c_str());

multiBlock->SetBlock(blockNum, imageData);


The call to record->getRecordName().c_str() will be different for each  
block
that is extracted, based on what the user asked for in the GUI. So  
what you are
saying is the name of the Scalars must be the same, for each and every  
block? Is there a way to tag a Human readable string onto each block  
so that it shows up in the GUI? Lookup table or something else?

In a quick check it looks to have made a difference. I will report back 
if I see anything as I have a chance to use it more on the cluster. 
Thanks Ken!

OverView binaries are not a part of the ParaView 3.6.2 binaries. You
can check out CVS with tag "ParaView-3-6-2" for get OverView.

I am just saying that PV (at least used to) treat partial arrays 
specially. It's something to be aware of. In terms of displaying strings 
in the UI have you tried to set
vtkCompositeDataSet::NAME() on the leafs? I see that is used by various 
readers and recognized by PV, you might look closer at that.

Ok. But wouldn't that just set the name of the multiblock dataset that  
holds all the extracted datasets? I am looking for something like:  
multiblock->SetDataName(blockNumber, Name);

And for those names to show up in the gui somewhere I guess.

Good afternoon,

I have noticed last week that Takuya's OpenFOAM reader is now included in the cvs version, which is good !
I know that in the last versions of the reader, a "refresh" button was included in order to reload the case / is this
something that could be included in the cvs version  as well ?

Regards,

PO

Thanks Utkarsh, Berk:

I found a similar posting:

http://www.mail-archive.com/paraview at paraview.org/msg02936.html. Is
there o bug for it so far?

My current workaround is to extract BLocks (from EnsightReader) and
numbering them using Python functinality:

dict ={}
source = GetActiveSource()
if not source:
    raise RuntimeError, "This macro needs an active pipeline object"
source.UpdatePipeline()
cdi = source.GetDataInformation().GetCompositeDataInformation()
blocks = cdi.GetNumberOfChildren()
for i in range(blocks):
    dict.update(cdi.GetDataInformation(i) : i+1)


Afterwards dictionary dict contains name of the block and its according
index. However it only works if:

    * Blocks are numbered starting from one without spaces

This was the case for all my tests so far. Is this always right?

Regards.

if you set the vtkCompositeDataSet::NAME() in each block it will show up 
in the object inspector information tab. I attached an example.

Hi Pierre-Olivier,

The reload feature is not included because I used a GPLed version of
Qt 4.3 for the development (thus I thought that part had to be GPLed)
when I submitted the reader.

Also, the reader is based on a version of around a year ago that
supports syntaxes up until OF 1.5 (no support for regexps) since I had
to do some specific works in order to resolve compilation issues on
some dashboard platforms. I am thinking about resubmitting the latest
reader after everything settles and have some feedbacks.

Hi,

I get the following error when opening the documentation on my branded
version of ParaView:

    No Qt compressed help file (*.qch) was located.

How do I set it up so that it will display the original paraview
documentation?

Thanks,

I'm a bit confused with the help - does the qch file contain all html files
and images?  Or would I still need to distribute the Documentation
directory?

Note: I still haven't sorted otu the missing help file problem....

Regards,
Paul

Message-ID: <c9adba421001200252g25bdc6dejf6e418367943014d@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm running linux and would like to set the icon that appears in the corner
of the window.  Is there a macro for this?  The application icon doesn't
seem to work (or even get included) - it looks like this is only used for
the windows version.

Thanks,
Paul

Hi,

 

I have vtk quadrangle mesh i visualize with paraview.

 

I have a problem : paraview displays the diagonals of every quadrangle element in my mesh. How do I eliminate them from display ?

 

Thank you,

I resolved this issue by removing the OSMesa libraries from the build.
Everything works fine now.

Subject: [Paraview] Problems with WriteImage using pvpython


I am coming across a weird problem. I'm attempting to use the WriteImage
paraview.simple command in batch mode. However, whenever I run the script it
gives me a segmentation fault; no other error appears. The same script runs
fine via the Python Shell. I am using ParaView version 3.6.2-RC1, which I'm
assuming isn't supported now. I'm just wondering if anyone else has seen
this behaviour before and whether they have a solution for it? Is it a
problem with the initial build? With the cpacking?

Adriano

Example Script:
filename="test.case"
data_reader = EnSightReader(CaseFileName=filename)
Show(data_reader)
WriteImage('test.png')

Output:
paraview version 3.7.0, Date: 2009-10-03 vtkGenericEnSightReader : [
...........] vtkPVGeometryFilter : [ ...........] vtkPVCacheKeeper : [
...........] vtkPainterPolyDataMapper : [ ...........] Segmentation fault

Hey Paul,

I was able to get the original ParaView docs to show up by adding this line to the build_paraview_client() macro section in CMakeLists.txt between GUI_CONFIGURATION_XMLS and SOURCES:

  COMPRESSED_HELP_FILE "${ParaView_BINARY_DIR}/Documentation/paraview.qch"

I just copied this from the {PV_src}/Applications/ParaView/CMakeLists.txt

Qt allows you set to the "window icon" in the ui file for the main
window. I believe it's a property on the QMainWindow.

It seems that the qch file contains everything. From the Qt docs ( http://doc.trolltech.com/4.6/qthelp-framework.html ):

"This binary file contains all information specified in the help project file along with all compressed documentation files."

Qt gives you setWindowIcon in QApplication but I can't see where this is
being set for the main ParaView app.

Is there a particular reason why you want OverView? If you want to mix
and match infovis and scivis, it is probably best done in ParaView.

The idea is that you would create a custom qch file for your
application with the on-line documentation for your application, and
then simply pass it into to the build_paraview_client() macro and then
the help should work.

Thanks - I have the docuementation working by adding:  COMPRESSED_HELP_FILE
"${ParaView_BINARY_DIR}/Documentation/paraview.qch"

re qch file: that's what I thought but the "make install" still copies the
whole Documentation directory with all the html and images.

Regards,
Paul

It was not meant to be preserved. For performance reasons the
extraction filter (vtkExtractSelectedIds specifically) sorts both the
selection list and the element id array so that it can do a quick
lookup of the usually numerous entries in the selection list.

I see. Is there any other way in Paraview I can get a list of points in the

That's not correct. You have triangles (hence the triangle strips). If
you want to display quads, you have two choices: use polygons for the
polydata or use quads with unstructured grid. It would look like:

POLYGONS 9 45
4 0 1 5 4
4 1 2 6 5
4 2 3 7 6
4 4 5 9 8

or (for unstructured grid) like:

CELLS 9 45
4 0 1 5 4
4 1 2 6 5
4 2 3 7 6
...

CELL_TYPES 9
9
9

Hint: Use the plane source and save it out as a ASCII VTK file to see
an example. If you want unstructured grid, first apply the Clean to
Grid filter.

PS: Is it OK for me to forward this to the paraview-users list?

A hack for the time being... I selected one point at a time and extracted
it. Then I append the data sets. This makes a resulting data set of the
points which were selected in the correct order.

Thanks,

Hi Berk,

I would like to do some graph visualization which is included in 
InfoViz/Titan project. To answer your question, I do want to develop 
infovis and scivis through Paraview IF POSSIBLE. I don't think I am 
gonna mix both infovis and scivis for a project.
Do you mean Paraview is the best platform to do both scivis and infovis?

Hello,

I've played the animation from http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Animation
without any problems in the GUI. But the keyframes and the
KeyFrameAnimationCue is not not registered in the GUI and thus not
visible as a track in the Animation View. I've tried to register them by
hand either in the animation, animation_keyframes and
animation_manipulators group. I can register them, but they are not
visible. If I want to register them in the sources group, paraview
crashes. Is there any possibility to make the keyframes and cue visible
in the GUI?

Hi,

thank you all for the attention. I've found a way to force ICEM CFD to
export the parts.

I used to export to Exodus II format by clicking on File -> Export Mesh ->
To Exodus -> Write Exodus Input File. This exports only the mesh and element
blocks. To export also the 2D parts, one can create "dummy" boundary
conditions on them, by going to File -> Export Mesh -> To Exodus -> Exodus
Family Attributes, selecting the part, clicking on "Create New" and "Side
Set" type of Boundary Condition. Then you can write the exodus input like
before. One has to do it for each part he wants to export, so, this can be
really annoying for large number of components. But this solves my problem
for now !

Our goal is to move towards one application/framework that can do both
- maybe with some customization. Then, we will be able to use this
application as the foundation of more vertical applications
specialized to different domains. OverView will be one of these
specifications.

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview crashes regularly during animation/rendering
Message-ID: <270E66C4-8D3C-42E5-AF27-5235A670BFF3@sjc.ox.ac.uk>

Hello.

I am running into a problem with Paraview when running animation on  
large (many million nodes/points) data sets.

When I animate and/or save images of each frame from large data sets  
Paraview will perform well for some (but usually variable) length of  
time and then crash.

I have had the same problem on Mac OS X and Linux and have been  
running on single workstations in all cases.

I am not a super experienced Paraview user so am having some trouble  
getting information out of Paraview to diagnose the problem.  Any  
suggestions on how to proceed, or on specific system information or  
crash reports that I can get from Paraview would be great.

Many thanks,

One problem may be caching. Go View | Settings | Animation and then
uncheck "Cache Geometry". Does that help?

You may want to watch PV's memory consumption as the animations 
progress. You said "large" and "single workstation", there is a chance 
that some operation is taking more memory than you thought it would 
causing PV to be killed. PV consuming anything over 80% in my experience 
is skating on thin ice. In case you're not familiar with it, the command 
line tool "top" will help monitor the situation.

On the Mac, you can also use Instruments, a fantastic tool. As Utkarsh
and Burlen mentioned, running out of memory is a common problem.

Do you get any output to the terminal on Linux (when you start from
the terminal)? Anything about exceptions?

Even if the clone only mentions the git: protocol, you can also use a
http transport.

Message-ID: <C77E1172.11103%kmorel@sandia.gov>

I believe there is a bug in git that causes the http transfer to fail when dealing with files above a certain size, and the ParaView repository has at least one such file.  That said, I also am behind a firewall and I have found (well, been told) two methods that have worked for me.  The first (and better but harder) solution is to set up a proxy for the git protocol.  To do this, first set up a script that tunnels connections through an HTTP proxy.  Copy the following into a file called git-proxy.sh.

#!/bin/bash
( echo "CONNECT $1:$2 HTTP/1.0"; echo; cat ) | nc <proxy-host> <proxy-port> | ( read a; read a; cat )

You will of course replace <proxy-host> and <proxy-port> with the host and port of your http proxy.  Also keep in mind that this script is supposed to be exactly two lines (regardless of whether it has been broken up by an email program).

Once you have this script, you then tell git to use it as the proxy for the git protocol.  Execute this script once and it will put the necessary parameter in the global git configuration for your machine.

git config --global core.gitproxy <path-to>/git-proxy.sh

I have gotten this to work on Mac and Linux.  I have not tried this on Windows.

If you cannot get that to work, another method you can try is to get the data from github.com via ssh, which I presume your firewall will let through.  To do this, do the following.


 1.  Create an account on github.com if you do not already have one.
 2.  Go to Account Settings -> Account Overview -> SSH Public Keys and add the public ssh key for your machine.
 3.  Go to the Kitware/ParaView repository on the github.com web site.
 4.  Click on the button to fork the repository.  This will create a clone of the repository under your account.
 5.  In your clone of the ParaView repository, you will see that there are more URL's available to download the repository via git.  Choose the private URL.  It will have the form git at github.com:<yourname>/ParaView.git.  Although it looks like the regular git protocol, it is not.  It is different.  Underneath it uses the ssh protocol (I think).
 6.  Anyway, paste that URL to a git clone command on your local machine.  As long as your ssh keys are set up correctly, you should be able to retrieve the repository.
 7.  Once you have a clone, you can create a new remote that points back to the original Kitware/ParaView repository.  At this point you should be able to pull updates directly from the Kitware/ParaView repository through the http protocol so long as no one adds a large file.

Hope that helps.

-Ken

Message-ID: <c9010c7d1001211401g5d5da0cdoa6ed9cfc9b64f888@mail.gmail.com>

Is there a reason that when I start up paraview that by default it has a
time series with 10 time steps?  If I load a file and then try to save the
geometry I get a pvd file that looks like:
<?xml version="1.0"?>

Subject: [Paraview] vtkSMProxy::GetProperty gives segmentation fault
Message-ID: <4B58D193.50401@rasmsys.com>

OS: Ubuntu 8.10 (intrepid)
PV:  3.6.1
Qt:  4.5.3
build:  Debug

I am working with a file-reading filter.  There are no error messages or 
warnings when I compile.  After I build, I copy the filter .so files to 
the bin/plugins location, where they are automatically detected by paraview.

When I choose the File, all goes well.  The usual RequestDataObject and 
RequestInformation methods are executed.  All my debug output looks fine.

When I press the Apply button, I know that RequestData is messaged and 
it seems to finish its work OK.

As an aside, my vtkDebugMacro output now only shows up in the gdb 
terminal output; it stops going to the output messages window of 
Paraview.  I don't know what that means, except that it seems to tell me 
that something is going haywire near the start of RequestData, even 
though that method seems to run fine.  (I suppose I'm not seeing it in 
the output messages window because that window may be buffered?)

The actual crash seems to happen just about when ParaView would normally 
be drawing an empty cube outline on the screen (the reader puts a 
rectilinear grid into the pipeline).

In the traceback (below), it looks like ParaView is messaging vtkSMProxy 
object that has not been instantiated... this=0x0

Has anyone seen this before?  Any suggestions on how to debug further?

Thanks,
Erik

ParaView is not (so far) tied to VTK releases.

This means ParaView3.6.2 used whatever was in the VTK development
trunk at the date of it's release. It is tagged at that time though,
so you can always checkout VTK with -r ParaView-3-6-2 if you want a
matching VTK. Alternatively you can checkout ParaView itself and just
build the VTK that is inside it.

I believe ParaView 3.6.x is using a Snap Shot of VTK CVS HEAD at the point
in time the 3.6 branch was created on 05/18/2009.

Can you verify that the xml for your plugin is valid? Just open in up
in firefox or something to make sure that the xml syntax is correct.

You probably want to use "Save Data" instead. Save Geometry is for
saving animation geometry.

Under windows you should find this file in:

%USERPROFILE%\Application Data\ParaView.

The config-file itself is called ParaView<version-number>.ini

And I guess that linux/unix installations use the same schema:
(eg: ~/.ParaView/ParaView<version-number>.ini).

The XML appears to be valid.  Any thing else I should check?

Message-ID: <3b6093ef1001221318m77e76524yfd1d3d11b9d7ef1e@mail.gmail.com>

Hello All,

I appear to keep getting a segmentation fault when I try to advance in time
using paraview 3.6.2.  Everything works fine using 3.6.1.  I am using the
intel compilers (11.0.083).  This is the output I get when I run it with
gdb:

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.

    at /home/peter/lib/ParaView-3.6.2/VTK/Common/vtkIdList.h:42
42      vtkIdType GetId(const vtkIdType i) {return this->Ids[i];};


Any idea on how to get around this?

Thanks,
Peter

Hi

I have solver which is often updating data. I would like to extend
paraview so that it can respond to those updates and reload updated
data. My idea create external python script to control paraview GUI
client pipeline and reloads data when data changes. Is that possible
and how (just short guidelines)?

Tnx

	when switching between windows
Message-ID: <a96e813b1001221618m779a7791vfad48d2af0640012@mail.gmail.com>

(Crossposted from vtkusers... Hoping I might get some responses here if
anybody has had similar issues.)

I've had this problem forever now, and can't seem to figure out what's going
on.

When I switch between a different window into my application window, the
QVTKWidget often only draws the overlapped region, with the other region
frozen in place. This also occurs in my compilation of Paraview!

Attached are three images that show how I replicate this problem in
(compiled) Paraview. However, I can't replicate this problem from the
downloaded Paraview binaries on the same machine.

Image 1: starting view.
Image 2: put a window over parts of QVTKWidget
Image 3: close the window, rotating the QVTKWidget with the mouse but only
the overlapped region updates!

I can restore a good image by: resizing the window, clicking on a different
window elsewhere, and sometimes just clicking anywhere outside of the
QVTKWidget but inside Paraview.

This same thing happens in my application's QVTKWidget, I'm guessing this
has to do with my compilation of VTK but I can't figure out what? (vista

Subject: [Paraview] Memory leak in Paraview 3.6.1(?)
Message-ID: <4B5AAC88.2020308@web.de>

Utkarsh,

I typically use python to load groups (sometimes up to a dozen) of VTK 
files  generated by each run of my experiment -- opening files manually 
is very tiring. However, whenever I clear the currently displayed files 
(using the "delete all" Edit menu option) Paraview never seems to give 
back all the memory it allocated. As such, after loading and unloading 
10-20 simulations, Paraview's memory consumption is so high that I 
either have to terminate the program or it crashes.

Here's the result of my typical run. I saved a small simulation to a 
state file and tried opening it and then clearing the data. The reported 
data is from the Windows Task manager (for some weird reason the task 
manager lists that the memory allocated to the Paraview process is 
greater than the process' virtual memory!?)

Initial (new instance of Paraview):
Mem usage: 75,272Mb  VM: 56,256Mb

After loading state file:
Mem usage: 89,512Mb  VM: 70,224Mb

After deleting all objects
Mem usage: 84,476Mb  VM: 65,132Mb

Another run, this time the python scripts are used to load the two 
simulation datasets. Growth in memory usage is more aggressive:

Initial (new instance of Paraview):
Mem usage: 75,304Mb  VM: 56,276Mb

After loading data set 1 via Python shell/script:
Mem usage: 113,264Mb  VM: 88,704Mb

After deleting all objects
Mem usage: 114,456Mb  VM: 89,688Mb

After loading dataset 2 via Python shell/script:
Mem usage: 126,116Mb  VM: 101,196Mb

After deleting all objects
Mem usage: 126,284Mb  VM: 101,388Mb

I'm aware that memory is dynamically allocated for the python shell and 
GUI, and their corresponding objects are probably kept in memory to make 
future launches of the python shell faster. This would explain why some 
memory isn't returned after the initial launch. However as this should 
done just once, the memory consumption should not grow each time a 
dataset is loaded using a Python script/GUI.

Also, after deleting a dataset and a new one is loaded, the following 
the message is frequently displayed.

qDrawShadeRect: Invalid parameters
qDrawShadeRect: Invalid parameters
qDrawShadeRect: Invalid parameters
..
qDrawShadeRect: Invalid parameters
qDrawShadeRect: Invalid parameters

A few other questions/suggestions:

1. Does the python command shell have a "run python script" command? For 
example: RunPythonScript("C:/Work/Data/Foo.py"). Such a feature would be 
a productivity boost. Clicking on the Tools menu and pressing the run 
script button is okay for loading a few datasets but tiring when there 
are lots of datasets to be evaluated. Also, it would be nice if the 
python command were dockable, with an autohide feature like Visual 
studio. Again this would be productivity boost. In fact it would be nice 
if most views had an autohide feature. This would be a quick way of 
increasing the size of the view window.

2. Does Paraview 3.6.2 have a disable offset feature as 
proposed/discussed here (I've searched but I can't find one):
http://tinyurl.com/yf86vwy

3. When can we expect to be able to have an external program send data 
to a Paraview, in the manner suggested in the following thread:
http://tinyurl.com/yfdyp7w

I hope I'm not being too greedy. I believe I speak for the entire 
community when I say we appreciate all your hard work.

Thanks,

Is it reproducible without using Python for creating the objects?
Easiest way to try that is create the objects using python, then save
the state out, then restart paraview and load the state file to create
the objects.

This issue persists in Paraview 3.6.2, with which I've just viewed a
relatively small data set (one polysphere and about a 40 line segments).
However, after disconnecting the server, thereby unloading the data,
Paraview's memory consumption remains at 103Mb -- that's not right. Why
isn't Paraview releasing memory from purged objects. If it matters, the
objects were imported using a python script.

Small correction. Memory usage values are in Kb, not Mb.

Hi there,

  What is the policy regarding the use of qreal versus double ? It
seems qreal has been used consistently almost everywhere in the code,
except one spot:

According to the Qt doc:
http://doc.trolltech.com/4.5/qtglobal.html#qreal-typedef

Is this ok to call the Qt function with qreal, then copy this qreal
into a double buffer. I do not think this will introduce to much
overhead.

Sorry to resend this, but the attachments were too big for the list. I 
put them here: http://nashi-submaster.ucsd.edu/movies/PV/save-cam-config/


Hi all,

The attached patch is for fetaure 9485 Save camera position(
http://public.kitware.com/Bug/view.php?id=9485 ) . This solution
provides a way of converting the camera configuration into an XML stream
which can then be either: stored in PV's internal settings to be later
accessed by one of 4 camera dialog buttons; or written to a file to be
later read back in. I attached screen shots of the modified camera
dialog and custom view button configuration dialog so you can take a
quick look and see what this is all about. Is this something I can
commit as is? If not what needs to change?

A little about the implementation follows and I'd like to propose adding
a related feature, the ability to individually save and load
configuration of PV's geomtry sources (point, line, plane, sphere etc...).

Saving and loading the camera configuration is a special case of a more
general missing feature, that of saving and loading a subset of an
individual proxy's properties. I am calling this configuration.
Something like state but much simpler, lighter and more portable. With
that in mind, rather than make a one off camera configuration
reader/writer, I took a more general approach in my solution and
implemented camera configuration reader/writer pair from abstract "proxy
configuration" reader/writer base classes. A simple way to use these
proxy configuration classes is to implement a derived class, and in the
constructor initialize the list of properties that will comprise the
configuration. The base classes can then handle the validation and IO of
the XML hierarchy. Using these classes one could also do something
similar to save and load any subset of any proxy's vector properties
pretty easily.

My intentions is that configuration can step in for state in the cases
where state is overkill, or doesn't work. For instance when trying to
reproduce a figure on a different cluster the most crucial aspects are
often the  positioning of geometric sources and the camera. these are
also often the most difficult to recreate by hand since they require
precise positioning. unlike state, configuration is not tied to a
specific cluster or connection. It also provides a quick way to
duplicate a source in the same session. A configuration file depends
only on a single proxy minimizing the risk of backward incompatibility
over time.

the gist of the approach I have in mind to expose this functionality for
PV's geometry sources  would be by way of a qt widget containing a load
and a save button placed in the object inspector auto generated panels.
The widget would only be added if the SM XML requested it. The XML would
be something like this:
<SourceProxy ...>
...
<ConfigurationManagerProperty>
   <PropertyDomain name="managed_properties" values="..."
</ConfigurationManagerProperty>
...
</SourceProxy>
The XML would be added to each of the geometry sources. The properties
that make up the configuration of an individual source would be
explicitly listed in the managed_properties attribute and passed into
the geometry source configuration reader/writer objects which would be
derived from vtkSMProxyConfigurationReader/Writer in the attached patch.

Is this going to be a committable feature? Comments and feedback are
much appreciated. I know its a really small feature, but I think it will
improve the user's experience, and resolve some frustrations with state.

Thanks

Message-ID: <dcdb4e1c1001250557j674e8d07n52ecc3d3699835e9@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
is it possible to save an element (contour, slice, ...) of the pipeline
browser in wtk format (.vtm extension) using Python?
For example, with CTRL + S we can save an element (contour, ...) in .vtm
file format: can we do the same thing using Python?
We only found how to save a state file...

Thank you very much

Yup that sounds totally fine. I've committed a fix to CVS head.

My guess is it has to go with compositing. Try setting the "Remote

Dear Friends,

I am new to Paraview. I am having trajectory data from simulation of  
granular particles.
I tried a lot to make a movie in Paraview but couldn't find the way to  
do it.

Please tell me the procedure to make movies from granular particle's  
trajectory data.

Thanks.

Message-ID: <AB48A31C4EC97E498F4235B7CEF74A1901E7DE6D8C@MBX00.d.ethz.ch>

I've noticed that custom plugin panels now remember their position between paraview sessions. By this I mean that if you dock one to the right/bottom/top etc,  the next time you run, it automatically re-docks itself to the same place.
This is great, thanks for fixing that.

Question : I'd like to save a number of custom dock panel settings so that when paraview is restarted, the panel repopulates itself with the values previously used.

Is there a generic method to do this inside the paraview framework? Do we use the usual Qt ini file mechanisms and just retrieve the master ini file from paraview - or is there some other way?

thanks

JB

Yes it's possible. Here's the example:

w = XMLMultiBlockDataWriter(Input=contour, FileName="/tmp/foo.vtm")
w.UpdatePipeline()

To load your data, if you have not done so already, search this list for many postings of the same question.

To display trajectories, use the "Particle Pathlines" filter

pqApplication::instance()->settings() with provide you access to a
QSettings subclass (pqSettings). You can add arbitrary key/value pairs
to it. A plugin can be assured that the correct settings will be
loaded and saved every time ParaView is started (unless it crashes of
course).

I loaded the trajectory using .xyz and .dat files (separately). But it  
gives an error.
The thins is that .xyz file contains the trajectory data and its not  
opening.
Whereas, with .dat file there is no error but lines are displayed  
instead of  individual particles.

Please help me in this issue.

Thanks.

Thanks, works a treat. Just for anyone else interested, it's pqApplicationCore, and the following example works nicely for my first test.

  pqSettings *settings = pqApplicationCore::instance()->settings();
  settings->beginGroup("DSMManager");
  // servers
  settings->beginWriteArray("Servers");
  for (int i=0; i<this->UI->dsmServerName->model()->rowCount(); i++) {
     settings->setArrayIndex(i);
     settings->setValue("server", this->UI->dsmServerName->itemText(i));
  }
  settings->endArray();
  // active server
  settings->setValue("Selected", this->UI->dsmServerName->currentIndex());
  //
  settings->endGroup();

Subject: [Paraview] Plugins for custom apps
Message-ID: <6F1FC2AC-65A5-4CCE-AC46-107C236B2C52@cs.duke.edu>

Hello,

I have a custom ("branded") app and a custom PV plugin. I'd prefer to keep the code for these separate, just for clean development, but I want the app to "know about" the plugin so it can package them together automatically. 

I can compile both at the same time by putting them each in their own subdirectory, and having a root CMakeLists.txt simply specifying the names of those subdirectories. But, when I list my custom plugin in the app's OPTIONAL_PLUGINS, it doesn't get packaged with the app libraries. (PointSpritePlugin does, though, as I told it to.)

Is there some less-naive structure I should be giving my project rather than just two separate subdirectories (and accompanying CMake files) so my app will "know about" my plugin (and maybe so they can also be built into the same "build/bin" directory, kind of like when paraview is built)?

Also, for clarification, the notes on the wiki for Writing_Custom_Applications says that OPTIONAL_PLUGINS should use "name of the plugin specified in the add_paraview_plugin call", but PointSpritePlugin works and it's actually the project() name rather than the add_paraview_plugin() name (which is CSCS_PointSprite_Plugin).

Thanks a lot,
-Eric

Could you be more specific about what format your files are in?  Many different file formats use the .xyz extension, and the .dat extension is so generic as to provide no real information whatsoever.  ParaView provides two readers that read files that use the .xyz extension: XYZ Molecular data files and PLOT3D files.  However, as neither of these files have an associated .dat file, I don't think either of those is what you want, which is probably ParaView is not reading the data correctly.

The thins is that .xyz file contains the trajectory data and its not opening.

Please help me in this issue.

Thanks.

Dear Friends,

I am new to Paraview. I am having trajectory data from simulation of granular particles.
I tried a lot to make a movie in Paraview but couldn't find the way to do it.

Please tell me the procedure to make movies from granular particle's trajectory data.

Thanks.

Subject: [Paraview] cone vs. cylinder glyph orientation
Message-ID: <5CA3CB9D-968C-4773-80DF-027D6A19A7AC@indiana.edu>

I'm confused as to why a cone glyph gets oriented according to a vector field but a cylinder glyph doesn't - or so it seems.

This trivial onept.vtk:

# vtk DataFile Version 3.0
vtk output
ASCII
DATASET POLYDATA
POINTS 1 float
0 0 0 
POINT_DATA 1
SCALARS scalars float
LOOKUP_TABLE default
0 

will orient a cone glyph pointing along the x-axis and a cylinder glyph along the y-axis.  Appending a (0,0,1) vector to this datafile:
VECTORS vectors float
0 0 1

will now orient the cone pointing outward along the z-axis, but the cylinder glyph still is oriented along the x-axis.  What am I missing? (Fwiw, I can't seem to figure it out in a VTK script either, using glyph.SetVectorModeToUseVector() )

thanks, Randy

Message-ID: <ef7bd411001252338r251235d5kd5458f0b594ff432@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
  I am attempting to use paraview's library to visualize medical volumes in
an application I am building from scratch.  The program is written in C++.
I am having a hard time finding adequate documentation (forums and examples)
that shows how to build an application that uses paraview's library in C++.
I have ran the example program BasicApp.cxx and it works, but it uses a
SphereSource.  I am loading dicom images or .vtk images.  When I edit the
code for BasicApp.cxx to load .vtk files I get an error after setting the
representation to volume.  From reading similar problems on forums, I think
the problem pertains to colormaps and scalars, but I cannot find
documentation on how to fix this in C++.  I'm including my code below.  I
may be over complicating this, but any help is appreciated.
Thanks for your time!

using namespace std;

// our main window
class MainWindow : public QMainWindow
{
public:
  MainWindow()
  {
    // automatically make a server connection
    pqApplicationCore* core = pqApplicationCore::instance();
    pqObjectBuilder* ob = core->getObjectBuilder();
    pqServer* server = ob->createServer(
pqServerResource("builtin:"));

    // create a graphics window and put it in our main window
    this->RenderView =
qobject_cast<pqRenderView*>(ob->createView(pqRenderView::renderViewType(),
server));
    this->setCentralWidget(this->RenderView->getWidget());

    // create source and elevation filter
    pqPipelineSource* source;
    pqPipelineSource* elevation;

    source = ob->createSource("sources", "SphereSource", server);
    // updating source so that when elevation filter is created, the
defaults
    // are setup correctly using the correct data bounds etc.
    vtkSMSourceProxy::SafeDownCast(source->getProxy())->UpdatePipeline();

    QStringList files;
    files.push_back("../brain.vtk");

    pqPipelineSource *reader;
    pqObjectBuilder *builder = core->getObjectBuilder();
    reader = builder->createReader(QString("internal_sources"),
QString("legacyreader"), files, server);


    pqDataRepresentation *repr =
ob->createDataRepresentation(reader->getOutputPort(0), this->RenderView);

    if(repr){

        vtkSMPropertyHelper(repr->getProxy(),
"Representation").Set(vtkSMPVRepresentationProxy::VOLUME);

        pqDisplayPolicy pqDisplayP = core->getDisplayPolicy();
        repr->getProxy()->UpdateVTKObjects();

    }

Subject: [Paraview] PV 3.6.2 and VisIt Plugin: crash when loading state with
 Tecplot files
Message-ID: <4B5EC975.6060803@onera.fr>

Hello.

PV 3.6.2 crashes on Linux when loading a state file (*.pvsm) that 
references Tecplot files.

Here is my test:

-Starting PV 3.6.2 (Linux), I load the VisIt plugin.
-I open two 3D IJK ordered Tecplot files (*.tp). No problem (PV freezes 
while loading the files, but I can continue after the files are loaded).
-I extract the J=1 surface for each file, I group the two extracted 
surface and I color this new dataset with one variable.
-I save the state of my work in a *.pvsm file.
-I disconnect to clear all data.
-I try to load the saved pvsm file. PV freezes as it does while opening 
Tecplot files, then it crashes!
The same crash happens when I try to load the state file after 
restarting PV and reloading the VisIt plugin.

Has anyone an idea?

Best regards.

Hi,
we installed ParaView 3.6.2 only on Linux Debian and, as explained here
http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView:Build_And_Install#Build_ParaView, we
installed the additional .deb packages required (mpi, qt4, python...).

But if we would install ParaView 3.6.2 on Linux RedHat Enterprise, should we
install any .rpm additional packages?

Thank you very much

Test 1: the simple pipeline that cannot be used as saved state:
- open Tecplot File 1
        |
        extract subset 1
- open Tecplot File 2
        |
        extract subset 2
- group subset 1 and subset 2 in new dataset 1
- coloring the dataset 1

Saving state of this pipeline, loading the pvsm file crashes PV.

Test 2: the more complex pipeline that can be used as a saved state:
- Open Tecplot File 1
- Open Tecplot File 2
- group loaded Tecplot Files 1 and 2 in new dataset 1
   |
   extract block 1 from dataset 1 (content of Tecplot file 1)
   extract subset 1 from bloc 1
   |
   extract block 2 from dataset 1 (content of Tecplot file 2)
   extract subset 2 from block 2
- group subset 1 and subset 2 in dataset 2
- coloring the dataset 2

Saving state of this pipeline, the pvsm file can be used.
Note: After loading the pvsm file, you must go on the reader of each 
tecplot file, select the arrays (unselected by default), then click apply.

Of course, I can attach the two corresponding pvsm files if it may help.

Hi Richard, please do. I will try running your steps with a debug build and
see if I can track down the crash.

Thanks for tracking this down!

Hi Dave.

I attached a tar gzipped file that contains the two pvsm files:
essaipv01.pvsm : state file of Test 1, crashes PV.
essaipv02.pvsm : state file of Test 2, OK.

I can't send my two formatted Tecplot files (too big) but I think you 
can easily rebuild them with any data from the headers below.
Each file is a formatted Tecplot file with name ending with ".tp"
There is only one zone (block) per file.
Each zone is a 3D IJK ordered grid with coordinates x,y,z and some other 
scalar arrays (pressure, temperature, etc...)
Following are the file headers where you will find the dimensions of the 
grids and the variables:

- File 1:
TITLE = "E_Fld0001_RAPRO2_F06_M020"
VARIABLES = "x" "y" "z" "vx" "vy" "vz" "M" "p" "Pi" "rok" "viscrapp" 
"ro" "tsta" "tgen"
ZONE T="Window(s) : Dom0001",  I=181,  J=9,  K=97, F=BLOCK

-File 2:
TITLE = "E_Fld0002_RAPRO2_F06_M020"
VARIABLES = "x" "y" "z" "vx" "vy" "vz" "M" "p" "Pi" "rok" "viscrapp" 
"ro" "tsta" "tgen"
ZONE T="Window(s) : Dom0002",  I=61,  J=9,  K=25, F=BLOCK

Best regards,

Richard

  I've got a set of data partioned in ensight and I am using the 
EnsightMaster Server files.

  If I open just part of the set (one of the case files) I can march in 
time without any problem.

  If I launch pvserver as a mpi process the time marching is not working. 
It keeps the same data and time evolves from

  0.0 to 0.1111 to 0.2222 to 0.3333 ...

  I also get this error in the xterm of the pvserver machine:

Dear All,

I was getting acquainted with ParaView features via tutorials but
suddenly my education was interrupted with a X Error. Whilst doing a
tutorial 2.8 from the 3.6 Version of The ParaView Tutorial and upon
clicking Volume Representation I am being propmpted with the following
message:

X Error: BadLength (poly request too large or internal Xlib length error) 16
  Extension:    135 (Uknown extension)
  Minor opcode: 1 (Unknown request)
  Resource id:  0x5a002cc

And also:
paraview: xcb_io.c:176: process_responses: Assertion `!(req &&
current_request && !(((long) (req->sequence) - (long)
(current_request)) <= 0))' failed.
Aborted

Then ParaView crashes.

I am running  OpenSUSE 11.2 with KDE 4.3.1. My Qt library bears a
number 4.5.3. If anybody encountered similar issued I would earnestly
ask for some assistance.

Many thanks,
Robert

I've seen BadLength errors when mixing mesa-dri and nvidia for glx 
client/server side.

"glxinfo | grep -i vendor" in a terminal can probably verify that.

I wish I could have understood this issue.  I tested a variety of 
things, examined my executable with ldd, tried various cmake variable 
changes.  The problem persisted until I got rid of the ParaView 3.6.2 
distribution, downloaded it again, and built again.  That fixed the 
problem.  So I figured I would post this to the list in case any other 
unfortunate developer has the same problem.

Hmm.  Sounds like there is something wrong with the format of your data or something is wrong with ParaView's reader or your data file is using some feature that ParaView's reader does not support.  At any rate, there is not enough information here to diagnose the problem.  It would help if you posted your data.  Hopefully someone on the list who knows more about the XYZ molecular data format can look into it.  (I have never used it.)

Could you be more specific about what format your files are in?  Many different file formats use the .xyz extension, and the .dat extension is so generic as to provide no real information whatsoever.  ParaView provides two readers that read files that use the .xyz extension: XYZ Molecular data files and PLOT3D files.  However, as neither of these files have an associated .dat file, I don't think either of those is what you want, which is probably ParaView is not reading the data correctly.

I loaded the trajectory using .xyz and .dat files (separately). But it gives an error.
 The thins is that .xyz file contains the trajectory data and its not opening.
 Whereas, with .dat file there is no error but lines are displayed instead of  individual particles.

 Please help me in this issue.

 Thanks.

Subject: [Paraview] Peavip enables VTK filters and sources in ParaView
Message-ID: <e7f43c4f1001261329o3edafb2ekdca4f29a2591faf6@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I launched a few months ago an initiative on github. This is called Peavip
and aims at
exposing VTK filters to the ParaView GUI.
The structure is as follow:
- each filter/source has its own XML description
(ServerManagerConfiguration)
  It allows for fast loading of particular filter, without having to build
something
- a CMakeLists gathers the XMLs in order to produce a cxx plugin
  The user can load all XMLized filters thanks to a single so/dll/dyn file.

This git repository is under development, and new features wil be added, I
hope, soon.
Coming next:
- Choice of exposed filters during the CMake setup
- Documentation!!
- Categorization of filters in the "Filters" menu from ParaView
- ... ideas from the community

You will find the Peavip git repository here:
http://github.com/jeromevelut/Peavip

Although this is a pre-alpha-Proof-of-concept-preliminar software,
I hope that it will be useful for people. Feel free to send feedbacks!

Best regards,
Jerome

Hi Richard and Dave,

I think that the way the VisIt plugin currently communicates information 
between client and server is not going to work with state.

The way it is now the plugin repeatedly sends variable length vectors of 
array,block,material ids,, etc one array for each mesh. Each of these 
might have a different size depending on the user's selections. In order 
to work around the fact that PV sm vector props don't support variable 
length vectors it also expects the array of mesh ids to be sent first, 
from this it sizes the other arrays to fit what will be incoming.

One solution would be to serialize the users selections in a single 
string, using sm string vector property to send server side. That would 
work with state. Otherwise I'm afraid your going to have to do some 
heavy sm programming.

I regret the way I did that, if it's helpful I'll volunteer to fix it.

Hi,

You should include the exact error message you are getting so that people
can help.

I'm not very familiar with building custom apps using paraview so I won't be
able to answer your question exactly... but to change the representation to
volume you must create proxy objects for a lookup table and a piecewise
function, then assign them to the representation's proxy properties
LookupTable and ScalarOpacityFunction.

The best example I have is in python- a image-data source is created and the
representation is set to volume, the scalar value 37 is set to the color red
with an opacity value of 0, and scalar value 270 is set to the color blue
with opacity value 0.5:

Wavelet()
rep = Show()
rep.ColorArrayName = "RTData"
rep.Representation = "Volume"

lut = CreateLookupTable()
lut.RGBPoints = [37, 1, 0, 0, 270, 0, 0, 1]
rep.LookupTable = lut

func = CreatePiecewiseFunction()
func.Points = [37, 0, 270, 0.5]
rep.ScalarOpacityFunction = func

Render()


Goodluck!

Hi Burlen.

Thank you for this answer.
Working with state files (as we do with layout files with the Tecplot 
software) is essential when you have big pipelines. Imagine you spend 
one hour to build a big CFD pipeline... and you have to rebuild it each 
time you want to analyze new data! Really, it would be helpful if you 
could fix this problem in a future release. And also, it would be fine 
if the state file could save what arrays are selected in the Tecplot 
Reader (no array is selected when loading state, but is it a PV problem 
or a VisIt problem ?).

The work around with the actual release is to use the "Group datasets" 
filter to build a new dataset from the Tecplot readers. At least, it 
works with single zone Tecplot files, but I will make other tests with 
multi-zone Tecplot files.

PS: I discovered another bug. PV crashes when loading state (with work 
around) referencing Tecplot files if the Tecplot files are not found!

Best regards.

Hi Dave and Burlen

Another Test loading state for a Tecplot file that contains two zones works!

- Read two zones Tecplot File
- Extract Block 1
  | Extract subset 1 from Block 1
    - Color Subset 1
- Extract Block 2
  | Extract subset 2 from Block 2
    - Color Subset 2

Another Test loading state for a Tecplot file that contains only one 
zone crashes PV.
- Read single zone Tecplot File
- Extract subset
- Color Subset

A final Test loading state for a Tecplot file that contains only one 
zone and using "Group datasets" filter works!
- Read single zone Tecplot File
- Group datasets
- Extract subset
- Color Subset

So the problem happens only when reading single zone Tecplot files. The 
work around is always to use the "Group datasets" filter after reading, 
even if there is only one file! No problem occurs when reading a 
multi-zone Tecplot file.

Best regards.

Message-ID: <273369da1001270503p6b4be7e9p354c679e5f8c05cc@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am new to Paraview, thanks to the new Netcdf Reader of 3.6 release. (Thank
you very much for that)
Therefore my problem is probably really trivial but I can't get it
resolved...
I am reading 2 or more netcdf file describing several part of the grid.
The complete domain is a cube(rectilinear grid), sliced in a given number of
files. There is no ghost cells so there is no obvious match between files.
When I try to merge the different block (using the group dataset filter or
merge block), I end up with a split domain, leading to a visual gap between
each sub-domain, whether I am plotting contour , vertical plane or whatever.
Is there a way to "really" merge those subdomain to end up with a single
domain.

Thanks in advance!

Julien

Dear Friends,

In Paraview Tutorial for version 3.6, a link is given for downloading
example files for the respective examples explained in the tutorial. But
there is nothing to download on that web page displayed after clicking
to that link. Please help me in this regard as it is difficult to learn
from tutorial without those example files.

Thank you very much.

With best wishes,

Ashish

Thanks Ken for your kind help.
I have changed the format of my input file to .vtk, and can visualize
the particle's configuration easily.

Thanks.

Hello Adebayo,

Sorry I'm not going to address your question directly (because I don't know the answer), but I wanted to make sure you know about other options that are available to you for building applications based on ParaView. Maybe you've thought all of this through  already -- in that case please excuse me.

If you want or need the capabilities of ParaView to deal with large data sets, or if you want to just build upon other nice existing elements of ParaView, but you don't need all of its functionality, there is now a much easier way to build a simplified / customized version of ParaView through "branding". This wiki page describes the process:

http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Writing_Custom_Applications

There are also six examples in {PVsource}/Examples/CustomApplications.

This way it is not difficult to get ParaView's basic functionality, and then add your own custom readers, filters, widgets, etc, through plugins. 

If you don't need to scale your application to very large data sets, then personally I find it easier to build a custom application directly using VTK rather than building upon ParaView's libraries.

Take care,
-Eric

I am having a hard time finding adequate documentation (forums and examples) that shows how to build an application that uses paraview's library in C++.  I have ran the example program BasicApp.cxx and it works, but it uses a SphereSource.  I am loading dicom images or .vtk images.  When I edit the code for BasicApp.cxx to load .vtk files I get an error after setting the representation to volume.  From reading similar problems on forums, I think the problem pertains to colormaps and scalars, but I cannot find documentation on how to fix this in C++.  I'm including my code below.  I may be over complicating this, but any help is appreciated.

Try using the clean to grid filter.  Although all of the cells are in the
same data set (probably an unstructured grid), the filter does not realize
that there are duplicate points and because of this the grid connectivity is
probably not what you're expecting.

Well, actually I think I tried all the filters, included the clean to grid
one.
In my case there is actually no duplicate point between files:

for example:

file-1, z-coord: 0.0,0.1,0.2
file-2, z-coord: 0.3,0.4,0.5

And the grid is structured.

Maybe in this case there is no way to make a single dataset?

Subject: [Paraview] Python Shell in branded app
Message-ID: <c9adba421001270739u480e2236if7df17beea33fd97@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

The Python shell is not working in my branded app.  Below are the errors
appearing in the shell:


Python 2.6.2 (r262:71600, Jul 17 2009, 14:08:37)

>>> from paraview.simple import *

 I do not get these errors if I run "pvpython" or the main "paraview" app.
Any ideas?

Thanks in advance,
Paul

Hi Paul,

Do you have custom proxies defined in your xml? I've seen a bug like this
before when there are parentheses in the proxy Label attribute.

Hi,

when trying to start pvserver on the my ParaView server linux machine, I'm getting this new

I don't know why it would work for paraview and not the branded app,
I'm not going to be able to answer your question, but maybe I can help
debug.  You could you edit
/home/paul/DEV/BrandedApp/lib/paraview-3.7/paraview/servermanager.py
and add this after line 2488:

        if not proto:
          print "Failed to initialize proxy '%s' in group '%s'" %
(proxyName, groupName)
          continue

To be clear, I meant first use the group data set filter or merge block
filter to put all of the cells in the same data set and then use the clean
to grid filter to get rid of duplicate points.  Points won't get merged if
they are not within a certain distance from each other.  So again the real
problem isn't that all of the cells aren't in the same data set but the fact
that the grid connectivity is not correct.  If you are doing this in
parallel this can also have an affect on appearance due to not having the
correct connectivity between cells on different partitions/processors.

If you can give me a more detailed description of the problem and send the
grid I can take a closer look at it.

Subject: [Paraview] Correct Extents for vtkImageData + Crash in ParaView
	3.6.2
Message-ID: <811a1f291001270816k6f6ff9h5b8488508637b710@mail.gmail.com>

I am reading a data file that is a has dimensions 189 x 201 x 1.

 During the RequestInformation I set the WHOLE_EXTENT to:
 int NumEvenCols = 189;
 int NumRows = 201;
  extents[0] = 0;
  extents[1] = NumEvenCols-1;
  extents[2] = 0;
  extents[3] = NumRows-1;
  extents[4] = 0;
  extents[5] = 0;

outInfo->Set( vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::WHOLE_EXTENT(), extents, 6 );

Then in the RequestData() method I initialize each vtkImageData object
(there are 6 output ports):
//------------------
output->SetScalarTypeToFloat();
int xDim=NumEvenCols;
int yDim=NumRows;
int zDim=1;
output->SetDimensions( xDim, yDim, zDim );
output->SetNumberOfScalarComponents( 1 );
output->AllocateScalars();
output->GetPointData()->GetScalars()->SetName("Data");
output->GetPointData()->SetActiveScalars("Data");
//------------------

The data seems to be read OK but when the GUI tries to finish up the
display I get an "Unhandled exception at 0x01462f3f (QtCored4.dll) in

Now, what is odd is that if I set the Z Extent from 0 to 1, then I get
a rendering except that the rendering is wrong because there are now 2
slices in the z direction. So what am I doing wrong? I can send code
and data file if necessary.

Hi,

The documentation is not workings for sources and filters - it gives the
following error:

 QTextBrowser: No document for qthelp://
paraview.org/paraview/ParaViewFilters.html


I ran "make HTMLDocumentation" before "make install" and I can see the files
in the Documentation directory.  Is it just me?

Thanks,

Message-ID: <63818.94.192.82.186.1264612978.squirrel@webmail.bris.ac.uk>

Hi
I recently undertook a project visualising 2nd order symmetrical stress
tensors. I am currently looking at how to use Paraview to visualise a
structured grid of these tensors using glyphs (either elipsiods or
hedgehogs) with data taken from the finite element program MSC NASTRAN. I
was wondering if there was a way of creating a VTK file from the ones
produced by NASTRAN.

Thanks Jacob

Greetings Jacob,

Assuming you are using MSC/NASTRAN, this maybe a long shot.  
MSC.Software has an Exodus-II preference for Patran.  You may have to 
lean pretty hard on your MSC.Software office in the UK first, to 
convince them it exists, and second, to obtain it from them.  (If you 
have Patran, it may be just a matter of looking for the Exodus-II 
preference as an output option.)

With the Exodus-II preference in Patran and after reading in your 
MSC/NASTRAN results, I am pretty sure you can write an Exodus-II results 
file that ParaView can read.

Good Luck,

Sam Key

Nope, it's not just you and that's by design. We don't add an explicit
dependency to t he HTMLDocumentation target to avoid building the
documentation during development builds as that can cause building on
windows (or without rpaths).

Are you sure the display is accessible on the server machine? What
happens when you open something like gvim?

If you just make the reader produce a single output (change the number
of output ports to 1) does it work?

I never used the the -X option when connecting with ssh on the server in order to initialize pvserver.

I think now the solution is to use the -X but start pvserver with option "-dc"

Good Question.
    I kinda gave up and rewrote it as a MultiBlock Reader with a  
single output which now seems to be working. If you want me to go back  
and try out the old reader with a single output port I can pull from  
GIT and try it otherwise I am moving on..

I am tempted to believe it has something to do with the fact that
ParaView tried to create 6 views to show the each output port or
something like that. I've added a bug
http://paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=10193

The view creation logic needs some clean up esp for multiple output ports.

Eric,

I am tempted to deprecate the OPTIONAL_PLUGINS and REQUIRED_PLUGINS. I
think if a branded app needs a plugin, it should directly link against
it (using TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES or EXTRA_DEPENDENCIES in the
build_paraview_client macro). and then use the PV_PLUGIN_IMPORT_INIT,
PV_PLUGIN_IMPORT macros, as documented at the following link, to
import the plugin into the application.

http://paraview.org/Wiki/Plugin_HowTo#Plugins_in_Static_Applications

Any opinions?

Utkarsh

Ok. Thanks. At least I am not going crazy. I was noticing that if I  
ask for a "2D" data set, ParaView will create a new view instead of  
rendering the data into the existing 3D view. 2D is defined as a data  
set where the z extents have a delta of 0.

Burlen,

Sorry for the delay in responding. I guess your solution is fine.
Ideally, I'd have liked tuples of group-names and proxy-names, but
that'd break backwards compatibility and really isn't such a common
use-case :), so not worth the to trouble.

Feel free to commit your patch -- just makes sure it works with
existing plugins :).

Yup, what you noticed is true. ParaView destroys the current view and
then creates a new one if the existing one is empty and I think
there's a bug there. Maybe it's trying to destoy an already destroyed
view :), I will have to look.

Subject: [Paraview] Extents different down the pipeline - Why?
Message-ID: <44161FEA-A75E-4AB8-90DC-385D7A0D6E71@bluequartz.net>

In developing a Filter that takes a MultiBlockDataset as input I am  
having some issues with the extents that the pipeline gives versus the  
extents that the data sets within the Input MultiBlockDataset. The  
output from the filter is a vtkImageData object.

  The datasets within the MultiBlockDataset all have extents of 0-188,  
0-200, 0-0, yet if I have the following code:

vtkTypeInt32 updateExtent [ 6 ];
if (outInfo->Has(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_EXTENT()))
{
updateExtent [ 0 ] = (outInfo- 
 >Get(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_EXTENT())) [ 0 ];
updateExtent [ 1 ] = (outInfo- 
 >Get(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_EXTENT())) [ 1 ];
updateExtent [ 2 ] = (outInfo- 
 >Get(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_EXTENT())) [ 2 ];
updateExtent [ 3 ] = (outInfo- 
 >Get(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_EXTENT())) [ 3 ];
updateExtent [ 4 ] = (outInfo- 
 >Get(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_EXTENT())) [ 4 ];
updateExtent [ 5 ] = (outInfo- 
 >Get(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::UPDATE_EXTENT())) [ 5 ];
}

  I get "0 188 0 200 1 1" as the values for the "updateExtents"  
variable. This then plays havoc as I am trying to get the pointer to  
the front of each data set like this:

float* phiF = static_cast<float*>(phi- 
 >GetScalarPointer(updateExtent[0], updateExtent[2], updateExtent[4]) );
  which then gives the error:

ERROR: In /Users/Shared/OpenSource/ParaView3/VTK/Filtering/ 
vtkImageData.cxx, line 1473
vtkImageData (0x22fb32b0): GetScalarPointer: Pixel (0, 0, 0) not in  
memory.
  Current extent= (0, 188, 0, 200, 1, 1)

For this filter I do NOT have a RequestInformation() method. I tried  
adding one and setting the outInfo- 
 >Set( vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::WHOLE_EXTENT(), extents, 6 );  
but that didn't help and in fact set the pipeline extents to 0, -1, 0,  
-1, 0, -1 instead.

  I think my "Reader" class further up the pipeline might be setting  
something wrong? as I can use this filter from another "Reader" that  
reads the same type of data, but from an HDF5 file instead and the  
filter performs as expected. Or it is just lucky somehow and works.

Any insights would be most appreciated.

  This is with ParaView 3.6.2 running on OS X and Windows 7.

I can never remember what group what needs to be registered :). But
it's always easy to find that out. Just do "representative" actions in
the GUI and save the state file out. That lists the groups and what
proxies were registered in those groups.

Hey Utkarsh,

I think that should probably work out fine. I'll have to play a bit to see if I can get it to work, since I've never tried that before.

I agree that if an app "needs" a plugin, it makes sense to require that it links to it at compile time. I'd still sort of like an option, though, that allows me to automatically package plugins with my binaries, but not have to build them in to my MainWindow class if they're not required for the application to function properly...

If you're building a non-static app, do the plugins imported this way still get their libraries dynamically linked at runtime, or do they get built right into the main executable?

Thanks,
-Eric

Subject: [Paraview] Extra camera reset in python macro
Message-ID: <0FA6835D-2250-42E4-B517-2A71CE8FA651@cs.duke.edu>

Hello,

First of all, I've been playing around with the new python interface and trace functionality in PV, and it's really a great improvement!

But... :) It seems like the first time I run a macro (from the PV python shell "Run selected" button) which contains some camera adjustments, the camera gets reset at the end. If I delete all of the pipeline elements and run it again without restarting PV or pressing Disconnect, the scene ends up with the correct camera settings. If I disconnect before running it again, the "reset at end" behavior is repeated. The same thing happens when running in ipython, outside of PV.

Here's a sample script -- if the camera settings are correct you should not see space around the group of glyphed points (it is zoomed in a bit on the cluster):

# =============================
try: paraview.simple
except: from paraview.simple import *

PointSource2 = PointSource()
PointSource2.Radius = 200.0
PointSource2.NumberOfPoints = 100

Glyph1 = Glyph( GlyphType="Sphere" )
Glyph1.MaskPoints = 0
Glyph1.RandomMode = 0
Glyph1.SetScaleFactor = 1.0
Glyph1.ScaleMode = 'off'
Glyph1.Orient = 0
Glyph1.GlyphType.Radius = 5.0

DataRepresentation2 = Show()

RenderView1 = GetRenderView()
RenderView1.CameraViewUp = [0.01, 1.0, -0.06]
RenderView1.CameraPosition = [37.0, 190.5, 640.7]
RenderView1.CameraClippingRange = [91.9, 1018.7]

Render()
# =============================

The main problem is that this keeps me from using the python macros like the old lookmarks because I don't get a repeatable camera view right after starting up PV. 

I'm using CVS ParaView from Jan 19 on OS X 10.6.2 built with CMake 2.9.20100113.

Thanks,
-Eric

Correction- if it is the first call to Render() after importing
paraview.simple, ResetCamera() is called automatically.

If you want to disable this behavior in your local build, comment out
lines 152 and 153 in Utilities/VTKPythoWrapping/paraview/simple.py.

Subject: [Paraview] Extra camera reset in python macro

Hi Eric,

This is by design.  When calling Render() from python, if this is the
_first_ render for this render window, ResetCamera() is called
automatically.  Your script will work if you insert a Render() before
you set the camera position.

When Berk first wrote the paraview.simple api he wanted to avoid this scenario:

  Newbie user creates their data and calls Render(), but sees a black
screen because he/she forget to call ResetCamera().

But now we have this scenario:

  Advanced user carefully sets the camera properties and calls
Render() only to find the camera reset :(


I vote we change behavior.

Pat

Hey Pat,

Thanks a lot for the explanation. If all it takes is a Render() before setting the camera position I can handle that for now. 

It does seem a little inconsistent as-is, but I can understand the logic. I think the main disconnect for me is if that newbie user is doing what I did and records a trace, saves it as a macro and then plays it back next time, they're not going to get what they expect.

Thanks again,
-Eric

Subject: [Paraview] VTK_Edge for LIC
Message-ID: <4B60B80F.60103@yahoo.de>

Dear group,

I have compiled VTK_Edge against paraview 3.6.2. Everything worked fine
except that make install did not install "libVTKEdge.so" to the install
directory - I had to copy this manually. Is this a bug or a feature?

Afterwards I can load libVTKEdge.so to paraview without problems.
However, where are the new features? I am especially interested in LIC
and I only found lic on 2D structured grids and LIC on image data in the
filters menu. Both are greyed off with my Ensight-Reader multiblock
unstructured grids. Does it only run on structured grid? Am I missing
something?

Regards BastiL

Message-ID: <97d9bd671001271429y2ecd7c04i685b88e3e1afdf0@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I am trying to install PV3.6.2 with the SILO option turned on.  When I try
the Configure in Cmake, it asks me to include the include and header
directories for Silo.

I have configured and installed Silo 4.7.2 and 4.6.2 on my local machine.
When I point to the relevant header and lib in CMake and press g to
generate, I get CMake warnings like the following

 WARNING: Target "vtkPVFilters" requests linking to directory
 "/home/rakesh/libs/silo-4.7.2/install/lib".  Targets may link only to
 libraries.  CMake is dropping the item.
....

WARNING: Target "paraview-real" requests linking to directory
 "/home/rakesh/libs/silo-4.6.2/install/lib".  Targets may link only to
 libraries.  CMake is dropping the item.


I installed silo by simply typing ./confugure --prefix=install_dir, make and
make install.

I am on a 32 bit Ubuntu 9.10 with gcc-4.3.4 and CMake-2.8.0.

Can some one tell me why I am getting these warnings, i have feeling it will
fall over when I try and build PV with the above warnings

Regards,
Rakesh

In fact we are now integrating LIC to VTK. One of the features is that flow
streaks are clearer than before in the resulting image.

You need to point CMake to the actual lib file (.so) not the directory it is
in.

This is the version of silo that is known to work for the silo reader
enabled by PARAVIEW_USE_SILO:

https://wci.llnl.gov/codes/visit/3rd_party/silo060605.sh

You may find that the file vtkSiloReader.cxx does not compile when
using the version of silo you have installed.  Goodluck!

Pat,

Spot on - during compilation, end up with errors like
/home/satheesh/libs/ParaView3/Servers/Filters/vtkSiloReader.cxx: In member
function ?vtkDataSet* vtkSiloReader::CreateRectilinearMesh(DBquadmesh*)?:

Digging around on the error, found that others also had similar  problem.

Am I correct in thinking, SILO is not really supported anymore and have to
go down the VisItBridge route?

Cheers,
Rakesh

The VisitBridge is advertised as the preferred method.  The
vtkSiloReader is not officially supported, but it does still work if
you use the older version of silo I linked to in my last email.  It's
possible that it will fail to read certain silo files that contain new
structures not available in the old version.

Look under the representation type. You should have a "Surface LIC"
representation type.

Hi Bastil,

if you see the filter "LIC on 2D image", etc. then the plugin is loaded
correctly. To visualize a LIC on a surface, you have to apply the
Extract Surface filter (DataSetSurfaceFilter) on it first. Then you
should be able to select LIC as representation form. Obviously this only
works, if a vector quantity is available on the surface.

Sorry, I probably wasn't clear with my original email - even though I ran
"make HTMLDocumentation" before "make install" i still got that error when
looking at the help in the GUI (even though I could see the files in the
Documnetation directory).

Zhanping,
 
Will the options to modify the density, thickness, and colour of the
streaklines be available to the user? It is definitely a good tool, but
sometimes we find it better to visualise using the standard streamtracer as
we can modify their appearance for clarity.
 
-Bastil: If you use extract surface, you'll need to make sure you have a
shear stress vector available on the surface (or create one before-hand),
assuming you are doing aero flows. However, if you use extract block on the
surfaces within the ensight volume data, you should be able to use the
velocity vector as input for LIC too (I think it takes the data just off the
surface for visualising, although I'm not sure). It isn't as nice as using
shear stress, but works well enough.
 
Regards,
 
Adriano

In fact we are now integrating LIC to VTK. One of the features is that flow
streaks are clearer than before in the resulting image.

Afterwards I can load libVTKEdge.so to paraview without problems.
However, where are the new features? I am especially interested in LIC
and I only found lic on 2D structured grids and LIC on image data in the
filters menu. Both are greyed off with my Ensight-Reader multiblock
unstructured grids. Does it only run on structured grid? Am I missing
something?

Andy,

Thanks for your help.
I have attached two simple files I am trying to merge. But looking at the
problem, I am afraid you will tell me that there is no solution.
As you will see there is no duplicate points,  thus Paraview cannot guess
it.
What is the best way to make them paraview-compliant? Add duplicate cells?
Thanks.

Julien

Hello everybody,

I've been trying to write a c++ function to convert my data into .vtu
files. Unfortunately, paraview isn't able to read my .vtu files. I get
the following error-message:

ERROR: In

I'm obviously doing something wrong... can anyone help? I really can't
find the error. Below, you find a sample .vtu file.
Thanks in advance!!

All right. I solved the issue. My graphic card drivers where not
properly installed. Re-installation of these have solved the problem
and now I have direct rendering again and can use volume.

Thanks for your hint.

Well it does not solve my problem ...

I never had this behaviour before / connecting with X was not necessary.
This problem started this week / last week cvs was fine.

Any idea why it's causing that ?

Thanks

Hey Kalpana,

You can get ParaView to display scalar or vector quantities associated with points while they are selected. If you select some points, then under the View menu open the Selection Inspector, at the bottom of this panel there is a section called Display Style. Click on the Point Label tab and check Visible. You will see a combo-box called Label Mode, and in this list are all of the scalars and vectors associated with your point data. 

The point coordinates are not listed, but you can can create a new vector that contains a copy of the coordinates with the Calculator filter. In the Calculator Properties panel there is a combo box/button labeled Vectors, and one of the entries should be "coords" (or you can just type coords in the equation line edit. You can rename the result to something more meaningful like Coordinates. Now when you select points from this new data, the new Coordinates vector should show up under the Label Mode of the Point Label section of the Selection Inspector.

Let us know if you have any problems,
-Eric

Dear friends,

I have a trajectory data of granular particles from a simulation. I can
visualize easily single configuration of particles using .vtk file. But
when I load the whole trajectory data having 100 frames (or particle's
configurations) then Paraview shows some error

Please guide me how can I do that.

Thanks.

Hey again,

There may be other ways, too, but you can do this with the Python Programmable Filter (PPF). To have two inputs to the PPF you need to select both data sets in the pipeline (on mac it's command-click, others may be control-click...) and then apply the filter. Here is a sample script which subtracts the coordinates of the two data sets from each other and makes a new vector data attribute out of that difference:

# ===========
from paraview.vtk import vtkFloatArray

in0 = self.GetInputDataObject(0,0)
in1 = self.GetInputDataObject(0,1)
pti0 = in0.GetPoints()
pti1 = in1.GetPoints()
numPts = in0.GetNumberOfPoints()

vec = vtkFloatArray()
vec.SetName('coordDiff')
vec.SetNumberOfComponents(3)
vec.SetNumberOfTuples(numPts)

for ii in range(numPts):
	# compute velocity and put in vec
	tmpDiff = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
	pos1 = pti1.GetPoint(ii)
	pos0 = pti0.GetPoint(ii)
	for kk in range(len(tmpDiff)):
		tmpDiff[kk] = pos1[kk] - pos0[kk]
	vec.SetTuple3(ii,tmpDiff[0],tmpDiff[1],tmpDiff[2])

out1 = self.GetOutputDataObject(0)
out1.ShallowCopy(in0)
out1.GetPointData().AddArray(vec)
# ===========

This doesn't do any checking for matching IDs of the points or whether both sets have the same number of points (I have an extended script which searches for points with matching ID if you need help doing that), but if they really match it will work. (Others can let you know if there are better ways of doing this or if I've done anything "non-standard" in my script.)

Good luck,
-Eric

If you just want to see a list of point coordinates, you could create a spreadsheet view and view your grid in that.

I'm still not completely understanding what you want done.  Since the two
data sets have significant space between them do you want to fill in that
space with extra cells or do you want to translate one of the data sets to
get rid of the space between?  If you want to add in cells then it might be
easiest to merge the data sets (GroupDataSet filter and then MergeBlocks
filter like below) and then use the vtkDelauney3D filter to create a new
grid that keeps the point data.

If you want to translate one of the grids to get rid of the space between
them you'll need to use something like the CleanToGrid filter to get an
unstructured grid from your rectilinear grid.  Then  you can use the
Transform filter to move it to the proper position (in this case
-0.10000001489999999 in the z direction for test.2.nc since the
vtkCleantoGridFilter is quite finicky).  Then use GroupDataSets filter to
merge the data sets into a multiblock (right click on the GroupDataSets
filter to select one of the test.*.nc files and the the Transform filter).
Finally, you'll need to use the vtkCleantoGrid filter again to get the
proper connectivity.  You'll want to check what it does with the point data
at the merged points though.

If neither of these is what you want then you'll need to be very descriptive
of what  you hope to accomplish in order for me to help you any more.

I've just run into the same problem (CVS updated at earlier in the week) and
I cannot run pvserver without a X display.  It means I can't run it on my
cluster (not even when using OSMesa and the --use-offscreen-rendering
option....)

Any ideas?

Thanks,
Paul

Please keep the discussions on the mailing list so that others can
contribute and benefit from the information.

I think the best solution is to create a custom filter that stitches the two
rectilinear grids together in the way you want.  Most other solutions will
convert your rectilinear grids to unstructured grids and thus use a lot more
memory.

Usually when you split a grid into multiple grids you'll get visual
artifacts.

Thanks for your help and sorry for the mailing list. I will
investigate the custom filters to get rid of the visual artefact. I
still have your solution. I was just afraid to miss an obvious way to
do it. Thanks again for your time.

Hi Ken,

You are correct. when VTK creates an OSMesa context is requests the 
default. OSMesa's default depth buffer is 16 bits, and that is the 
source of the problem. Explicitly requesting a 32 bit depth buffer 
solves the problems with the artifacts and the compositing. See the 
attached patch. Thanks to tom fogal for suggesting this during our 
conversation on the mesa-users mail list.

ParaView should probably default to a 32 bit depth buffer. I have just 
sent this to the vtk-dev list as well, since it looks like more of a VTK 
issue.

Subject: [Paraview] Choppy images
Message-ID: <3b6093ef1001281612s21b6aa7anb0f311ca1faecc96@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I'm trying to make black and white eps with images for a paper but they
appear to be coming out very choppy.  I've attached a pdf.  It almost looks
as if there is no anti-aliasing.  I'm using Paraview 3.6.1.  Is there a way
to set the level of anti-aliasing from a python script (I'm running batch
jobs).  I generated some very smooth eps figures last year (probably
Paraview 3.4).

Thanks,
Peter.

Hi Utkarsh,

The X display is being opened when the QApplication is created in
vtkQtInitialization constructor.  You added this call to vtkSMApplication
last month although the code is inside ifdefs for VTK_USE_QVTK.  I couldn't
see any cmake build option for this (unless it is VTK_USE_QVTK_QTOPENGL).

My current workaround is just to remove these calls and it seems to work....
- but I'm guessing you put it in there for a reason ;)

Regards,
Paul

Subject: [Paraview] VTKEdge LIC plugin greyed out
Message-ID: <ce5dae9f1001290421v74f7f6co681ac786a43095c6@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I am having a strange problem with the LIC component of the vtkEDGE plugins
for Paraview.
It compiles fine, loads fine, and even works fine when I command it through
the python interface.
The problem is that the LIC panel stays grayed out, so for the standard GUI
user it is impossible to change the parameters of the LIC.
(choose the vectors / intensity ...)

Does anyone know how to fix this ?
Best Regards,
Jacques

Hello,
I would like to see the topology of an unstructured grid but only the front or back enveloppe is displayed, depending on which kind of display is selected.
Is it possible to display the interior of the grid in wireframe?

Ah! Nice catch. QApplication needed to be initialized by the
SMApplication for chart proxies when using them through
pvpython/pvbatch.
Attached is patch. Let me know if that fixes the issue? I'll commit it tomorrow.

Message-ID: <c19fcadc1001291439p5261ecb2k9dc52c155c70e366@mail.gmail.com>

I am trying to compile a plugin. It is telling me:

syntax error
*** SYNTAX ERROR found in parsing the header file vtkPTXReader.h
before line 55 ***

This is the file it is complaining about:
http://www.rpi.edu/~doriad/Paraview_List/PTX/vtkPTXReader.h

That header works fine when compiling non-plugin executables. Is there
something in there that is not allowed for plugins?

Thanks,

David

Ah, I always forget about that. It worked, thanks.

Is there not a way that the parser can be modified so this isn't
necessary? It seems really awkward...

Thanks,

Subject: [Paraview] Reader did not create output
Message-ID: <c19fcadc1001291722n51569fc9k939e9ce5cc99b96e@mail.gmail.com>

I created a vtk class vtkPTXReader which is working as expected when
used from c++. I am trying to make a reader plugin for Paraview, but I
am getting the following error when I try to open a PTX file in
Paraview:

ERROR: In /home/doriad/src/ParaView3/VTK/Filtering/vtkDemandDrivenPipeline.cxx,
line 690
vtkCompositeDataPipeline (0x9657d68): Algorithm
vtkPTXReader(0x964f6a0) did not create output for port 0 when asked by
REQUEST_DATA_OBJECT and does not specify any DATA_TYPE_NAME.

My class and plugin xml files can be found here:
http://www.rpi.edu/~doriad/Paraview_List/PTX/

Can anyone see what the problem may be?

Once I get this figured out, I plan to add it to:
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Plugin_HowTo#Adding_a_Reader
as it currently doesn't have all the necessary information (namely the
main xml file).

Thanks,

David

Subject: [Paraview] VTKEdge LIC plugin greyed out

I have investigated further and my problems are simular.
Maybe my version is incompatible with Paraview 3.6.2? If I load the .so
first(without errors), I sometimes get crashes when loading the
Ensight-Dataset afterwards.... Loading it after the data usually works
better.
 I usually use "Extract Block" to extract surfaces from an Ensight
Multiblock and I have shear stress vector field on this. Afterwards I
can apply Lic on 2d surface filter but I always get an crash telling me
that input data is not 2D data. Does it only work with the "extract
surface" filter?
I never have an additional visualisation "Lic" beyond wireframe, surface,...

Regards BastiL

Maybe your Qt is to blame? Which version are you using?

If you are building ParaView, you will need the same sort of packages for RedHat
(mpi, qt, python etc.). If you are downloading the binary, you don't
need any extra
packages.

Bastil,

The problems you and Jacques are facing are probably not related.

VTKEdge from SVN trunck will not work with ParaView 3.6.2. You need
CVS ParaView for it. Refer to the following thread:
http://tinyurl.com/yamglvc

Once you've loaded your dataset, you should be able to directly choose
"Surface LIC" from the representation type combo-box on the toolbar or
the display tab. You shouldn't have to use Extract Surface or Extract
Block.

Another thing I forgot to mention, you typically want to load the
plugin before opening your dataset.

Ashish,

Can you be more specific? We can't really make a good guess by
"ParaView shows some error". What is the error? When does it happen?

In 3.8, this will be:

output.PointData.append(inputs[0].Points - inputs[1].Points, 'point_difference')

in the programmable filter. In the Python calculator, it will be:

inputs[0].Points - inputs[1].Points

and you'll choose the name of the array in another entry.

You can do this with the development version if you build it from
source. You will need to compile with Python support and have NumPy
installed.

To have two inputs to the PPF you need to select both data sets in the pipeline (on mac it's command-click, others may be control-click...) and then apply the filter. Here is a sample script which subtracts the coordinates of the two data sets from each other and makes a new vector data attribute out of that difference:

Hi Peter,

Set the resolution of the image to something high and it should look smooth.

I couldn't see anything obviously wrong. Try setting a breakpoint in
vtkDemandDrivenPipeline::CheckDataObject right before you open the
file. When you walk over that function, is there an output at all? If
no, is DATA_TYPE_NAME() set to anything?

Anyway, I am just interested in this tool to observe the connections in a specific zone, so I cancut part of the whole dataset before.

I set a break point in CheckDataObject. I stepped through - It skips
right to the 'else' on line 682 of vtkDemandDrivenPipeline.cxx.

I've never tried debugging in paraview before - is there a way to
check the value of DATA_TYPE_NAME() without adding an output line such
as:
cout << vtkDataObject::DATA_TYPE_NAME();

and recompiling?

It takes a long time to compile Paraview so I'm sure this is a
terribly inefficient way to debug... but the debugger in KDevelop3 (an
interface to gdb) doesn't show values of things when you hover the
mouse over them so I'm not sure how to see it without using this
method.

I looked at portInfo->Request->Name->*Name in the local variables of
the debugger and it is empty - is this the same as DATA_TYPE_NAME()?

I'm not doing anything fancy - my class is derived from
vtkPolyDataAlgorithm and I haven't changed anything related to the
pipeline except for:
this->SetNumberOfInputPorts(0);

so shouldn't this "just work"?

Thanks,

David

Sorry I'm not offering any help to your specific problem... but I just
wanted to say that debugging via cout/printf is a perfectly good way
to debug.  If you only change a cxx file and not a header, it should
only recompile one file and then do some linking, should only be 10
seconds to a minute depending on how old your computer is, not much
longer than firing up gdb, anyway.  Goodluck!

Two hints first:

- If you make a change only to the implementation (i.e. a cxx file),
you can use:

make vtkFoo/fast

where vtkFoo is the library that contains the .cxx file - in this case
vtkFiltering.

- To get the value of an entry in vtkInformation in gdb, you can do:

> print  vtkDataObject::DATA_TYPE_NAME()->Get(info)

Each key object has a Get method that takes the information object as
the argument.

Something is fishy. This will require some more hard-core debugging.
You may want to run this through valgrind first. If that shows
something, it will save you time. Also, you may want to try a clean
build.

If valgrind doesn't show anything, try this:

- before opening the file, set a breakpoint in
vtkPolyDataAlgorithm::FillOutputPortInformation
- after it sets DATA_TYPE_NAME(), make sure it is set
- write down the pointer address of info
- continue until vtkDemandDrivenPipeline::CheckDataObject, make sure
info is the same thing as portInfo

If they are the same, start again. After
vtkPolyDataAlgorithm::FillOutputPortInformation, someone is removing
DATA_TYPE_NAME(). The only way to track it is to walk until
vtkDemandDrivenPipeline::CheckDataObject in the debugger.

I suspect that this will be something like mismatching symbols between
libraries because something is not recompiled or some write beyond
array bounds. I can't imaging what else it could be.

Ah, I found it. I have a separate build of VTK - my project grabbed it
and was using it for VTK_DIR:

 ParaView_DIR                     /home/doriad/bin/ParaView3
 VTK_DIR                          /home/doriad/bin/VTK

I changed it to this:
 ParaView_DIR                     /home/doriad/bin/ParaView3
 VTK_DIR                          /home/doriad/bin/ParaView3/VTK

and then the plugin worked. Could the cmake be changed somehow so
VTK_DIR be set automatically to .../ParaView3/VTK? It seems like it
doesn't really make sense for it to be referencing an outside build
AND the internal Paraview VTK, so does it ever make sense to set
VTK_DIR to the non-paraview vtk?

Thanks for your help - even thought it was a stupid problem I still
learned something along the way :)

Subject: [Paraview] screenshot artifacts
Message-ID: <c19fcadc1001311114jb6b40cen1c5ed30e50e0ba23@mail.gmail.com>

Sometimes when I use "Save Screenshot", there are lines in the image.
You can see here:
http://rpi.edu/~doriad/Paraview_List/combined.jpg

that there is a vertical and a horizontal line. Is this rendered as
multiple images and there is a problem with stitching it into a single
image?

Thanks,

David
