Subject: [Paraview] Help on integration with vtkImageTwoInputFilter
Message-ID: <5BE159250B76344B9E60D32AFA6C865B02FD6FC4@BANMLVEM01.e2k.ad.ge.com>

Hi,

I had some difficulty in integrating the vtkImageTwoInputFilter with =
Paraview. Is there any modification required in the PVDefaultModules.h? =
I had tried with entries in the PVDefaultModules.h similar to =
vtkImageSingleInputFilter? I am getting an error 'Invalid Command'.
Appreciate your help on solving this.

Thanks

Hi,
 
I am practically a newbie to ParaView and VTK and I am trying to
visualize CFD-generated or measured velocity vector fields on top of a
geometry file exported from our CAD system (VRML format). However, I
find it difficult to get a satisfying result. Any response from somebody
who has experience with the presentation of velocity vector fields in
ParaView is very welcome. Some of the problems I struggle with are:
 
I would like to show velocity vectors as thin arrows (lines) instead of
the 'volume' representation I get when I choose Glyph and
Arrow0/Cone0/Sphere0 - is there another way to display vectors than
using the glyph-tool? - or can the glyph arrows be modified to be lines
instead of cylinders and cones?
 
I have been using a vtk data format where i have a POLYDATA dataset with
a definition of VERTICES and subsequently a definition of VECTORS - this
format has been working in conjunction with another VTK-viewer (MayaVi),
however I can not make ParaView read my files. Am I doing something
completely wrong? - I've attached a small example which can be read by
MayaVI!
I have been able to make a readable data file with the UNSTRUCTURED_GRID
dataset but wonder why my POLYDATA format doesn't succed - ParaView
simply crashes (WinXP).
 
If I could get a working example (or maybe a few) of a vtkdata file with
a velocity vector field I would be grateful!

Ulrik Ullum

Hello

I can confirm that I can read your data in ParaView without any problem.
I use the CVS nightly version.

A first idea to simplify your glyph representation is to edit the
definition of the arrow. 

Go to the Select Menu, choose Glyph, choose Arrow0, and if you set Tip
radius to 0, there will be no tip, just a single tube, whose resolution
you can further reduce.

Hi there,

I tried to build ParaView 0.6 these few days, and found that it can only 
be built with gcc-2.95 but gcc3.2.
Is there anything I should take care if using gcc3.2?
And after successfully build with gcc-2.95, in runtime, the following 
error comes up,

/opt/PV.06.standalone/bin/ParaView: relocation error: 
/opt/PV.06.standalone/bin/ParaView: symbol __8ifstreamiPCcii, version 
GLIBC_2.0 not defined in file libc.so.6 with link time reference

Any ideas?

Hi Julian,

We build ParaView every night with gcc 2.95 and gcc 3.2. Are you sure
your gcc 3.2 is correctly installed?

Hello,

I have written a paraview reader module that works fine on linux.

On windows, using the latest pre-compiled binaries for paraview
(release .6), and the vtk pre-compiled binaries (4.2), I get the 
following error when I start up ParaView:

It looks like ParaView could not find the component (the shared
file for the module you are loading) and tried to print an error
on stderr. Since there is no stderr on the Windows build, you
got this error. We'll fix the bug. However, you have to figure
out why ParaView could not load your library.

Subject: [Paraview] Parallel rendering
Message-ID: <200305221242.OAA12783@styx.bruyeres.cea.fr>

Hi,

Having written a new reader for ParaView, and testing it in parallel
mode, we got the full rendering to be done in every created window (and
overlapping windows didn't cause any display problem, so there seems not
to be any compositing either).

With another reader, for example .vtu reader, only part of the rendering
is done in each window, and the different parts are composited in the
main window as expected.

Could someone point out at what we might have overlooked ?

Regards,
Emmanuel
