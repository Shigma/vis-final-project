Subject: [Paraview] .vtk -> .pvtk
Message-ID: <1020306124012.ZM7657@kelgia.ncsa.uiuc.edu>

ParaViewers,

I have a single .vtk file (POLYDATA) that I'd like to partition/distribute
across a cluster and display using ParaView.  Is this (easily) doable?  If so,
where can I read about the format of .pvtk, etc.?

thanks,
Randy

Randy,

If you are running ParaView in parallel, it will automatically read your 
VTK file and break it up among processors.  It may not be efficient.  By 
default, each process reads the whole data set and then extracts the piece 
it needs.  If you set the environment variable PV_USE_TRANSMIT to 1, then 
this process is more efficient.  Process 0 will read the data set and send 
pieces to all the other processes.

If you save any data set while running with multiple processes, it will use 
the pvtk format.

The pvtk format is pretty straight forward. Each process writes a stand 
alone vtk file, and a top level (pvtk) file is written in xml format to 
"glue" all the pieces together.  The pvtk reader is smart enough to collect 
data from multiple files.  You can read with a different (smaller) number 
of processes that were used to write the file.

Let us know how it goes.

Charles.

Easy. Run ParaView in parallel, load the vtk file and
save it :-)

Subject: [Paraview] Replacing Public with the new server
Message-ID: <5.1.0.14.0.20020321174204.03565600@pop.nycap.rr.com>

Hello!

As several people noticed, public is becoming a severe bottle
neck. It's disk are too small, the processor is overwhelmed,
and there is little or to none protection against data lose.
It is about time to fix this problem.

We are working towards replacing Public.kitware.com with new
much more powerful server. The new server has features such as
dedicated ups, RAID-5 disk array, better CPU, more memory,
and much more space than the old one. We are planning to
replace Public soon, but before we do this, we would like
to notify all developers that there will be downtime. The new
server will look almost exactly the same as the old one but
some things might be in different place and we all should do
some spring cleaning on it.

We have not decided on when the replacement will happen, but
the new server is almost ready. We will let you know several
days in advanced, so that you can commit/update/checkout all
outstanding projects/files.

If you have any question, comment, or suggestion, please let
us know.
