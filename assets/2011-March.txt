Message-ID: <AANLkTim01aqBWOQKxM9zurzm3O66dA5q=My0==3NauPJ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everybody,

just a (very) simple question:

Which Paraview/VTK file readers already have full support for ghost/halo
data when running in parallel?

thanks

ps.: In fact, I'd like to figure out how I could get rid of my parallel
interfaces among partitions.

All readers should support ghost cells as long as:

- They support cell data
- They support unsigned char data

 (Note: you need ghost cells not points for this to work).

All you have to do is to add a cell array called vtkGhostLevels to
your data. Cells that are internal should have a value of 0, ghost
cells should have a value of 1 - or higher if you have multiple layers
of ghost cells.

Doing a quick grep in VTK/IO, I see that the legacy reader and the XML
reader support unsigned char. It doesn't look like EnSight supports
it. Xdmf supports it.

It would be relative easy to support signed integers by doing a
conversion at read time, if you guys think that it is important.

Hi Berk, thanks for your answer.

I think I'm missing something.... you said cells only?!

If I understood this subject correctly, a cell should be considered ghost if
it's held by more than one partition/process, isn't it?! In this case,
there'll be an overlapped layer of elements. The problem is that my MPI
solver does not make use of this overlapped layer of cells/elements. It only
has nodes/points that are shared by processes. This explains why I asked by
a ghost node (shared node would be more appropriated to define such kind of
node).

Can I consider a cell as ghost if it touches the parallel interface (without
overlapping)? Would it work?

Regards

Renato.

Yep. You understood correctly. Ghost cells are very common for finite
difference calculations but not as common for finite elements.

Nope.?Then you'd start seeing gaps. The right thing to do is for
ParaView to support ghost points (nodes) better. However, this is
non-trivial in some cases. For removing internal interfaces, it is
sufficient to mark points as ghosts. However, for accurately
performing statistics, you need to make sure that you count all points
only once, which requires assigning ghost nodes to processes. So a
replicated node would be marked as ghost (a better word is shared) and
also owned by a particular process. We are going to improve VTK's
ghost level support. This is something we'll support. However, it will
be up to the simulation to produce the write output. Do you have the
ability to mark a node as "owned" by one partition and as "ghost" on
other partitions?

Best,
-berk

Yes! We classify processes as master and slaves according to their ranking
numbers. After this we can assign the shared node to a master (which will
take care of shared computations) and tell the slave process that this node
is being shared with a master (and the slave process will consider it as a
"ghost" for computations).

The ideas we used in our parallel solver were taken from the following
article:

Karanam, A. K., Jansen, K. E. and Whitinig, C. H., "Geometry Based
Pre-processor for Parallel Fluid Dynamic Simulations Using a Hierarchical
Basis", Engineering with Computers (24):17-26, 2008.

This article was made available from the author in
http://www.scorec.rpi.edu/REPORTS/2007-3.pdf (Figures 7 to 9 explain the
communication method between processes),

Regards

Renato.

Great. Ping me in a 2-3 months - we should have started making changes
to the ghost level stuff by then. Until then, you should be able to
use D3 to redistribute data and generate (cell) ghost levels as
needed. So the following should work

reader -> D3 -> extract surface

Hi

I'm trying to build 2 independent views with the option of independent
filtering *and *joined filtering of the same data/object.  I want 2 users to
use ParaView with independent head-tracking, allow them to independently
apply filters to the same dataset, have the option of sharing the filters
between them and sharing the views.

In my test code attached below, the trackers are not able to control the
viewpoint of either windows.
The actual plugin code with 1 tracker and 1 view works:

pqVRPNStarter.cxx is only looking at the active view and that too the
active view when the plugin was loaded and hence it works only with 1
view.

You can access all available views from API on
pqApplicationCore::instance()->getServerManagerModel() (findItems).

pqServerManagerModel also fires signals when new views are created,
you need to handle those to set up tracking on those new view
correctly (and clean up when the view is closed as well).

Are you looking at structured data in a 2D view? If so this is
probably the bug I fixed around the 3.8 time frame with:
commit 78da8a8e1132f2ea62f920038d67937a37cdfba6
Date:   Tue Jun 8 10:39:36 2010 -0400
If so, bump to a newer release it should be fixed.

I believe this is saying that the Qt you are using wasn't properly
configured/built/installed. I've run into problems like this with some
Qt binary installations on some platforms (most often Mac) so I tend
to build Qt from source myself.

If you have built ParaView from source, you can turn off the GUI. The
server doesn't need Qt so this problem should go away if you build
ParaView without it.

Greg,

I think we all agree with you here.  The discussion of the padding was not
intended to be a justification for image inconsistencies.  Rather it is
intended to help us identify what is causing the problems and try to
prevent reintroducing more grievous artifacts that the padding was
originally supposed to prevent.

Subject: [Paraview] Using streamtracer/gradient filters on "multi-block"
	data set
Message-ID: <309588.115.qm@web36508.mail.mud.yahoo.com>


Hi,

I've read in a CAS file, which Paraview read in a Multi-block dataset, which contains within it a unstructured grid.

Initially I had a problem where all of the data items were one-tuple arrays.? So I created a UVW (3-tuple velocity) array and added it to the pipeline this way using a Python programmable filter:

input?? = self.GetInput()
output = self.GetOutput()

output.ShallowCopy(input)

****create array here***
output.GetBlock(0).GetCellData().AddArray(UVWArray)

Note that "GetBlock(0)" gives me access to the grid object.? For some reason the gradients and streamtracer filters were greyed out and unavailable.? So I decided to make the output variable a vtkUnstructuredGrid instead and transferred the UVW array to it this way:


p, li { white-space: pre-wrap; }output.GetPointData().AddArray(UVWArray)

Nope...didn't work.? Any thoughts how I can modify the pipeline so that the streamtracer and gradients of unstructured data sets array can become usable? I'm guessing there is something in those classes which tells Paraview that they require certain input types. I've seen references to stuff like FillInputPortInformation. 

Thanks,
Sohail


p, li { white-space: pre-wrap;

have arrays (scalars and/or vectors)? That's probably why those filters are
disabled. You can always use Extract Blocks to extract the block you are
interested in and then apply the filter. As for the Programmable Filter, if
you set the output type to vtkUnstructuredGrid, you should be able to do:

self.GetOutput().ShallowCopy(self.GetInput().GetBlock(0))

assuming that block 0 is a uns. grid.

Hi,

Let me correct myself; the block contained inside is a vtkStructuredGrid.? I did a printout what is in the pipeline (self.GetInput()):

p, li { white-space: pre-wrap; }

Hi,

Initially I had a problem where all of the data items were one-tuple arrays.? So I created a UVW (3-tuple velocity) array and added it to the pipeline this way using a Python programmable filter:

input?? = self.GetInput()

output = self.GetOutput()

output.ShallowCopy(input)

****create array here***
output.GetBlock(0).GetCellData().AddArray(UVWArray)

Note that "GetBlock(0)" gives me access to the grid object.? For some reason the gradients and streamtracer filters were greyed out and unavailable.? So I decided to make the output variable a vtkUnstructuredGrid instead and transferred the UVW array to it this way:



output.GetPointData().AddArray(UVWArray)

Nope...didn't work.? Any thoughts how I can modify the pipeline so that the streamtracer and gradients of unstructured data sets array can become usable? I'm guessing there is something in those classes which tells Paraview that they require certain input types. I've seen references to stuff like FillInputPortInformation. 


Thanks,
Sohail

Hi Berk,

I already did such test. It really works but the dataset must be serial and
loaded in a parallel session. In this case, D3 will take care of the data
distribution, load balance and ghost information. However, if the dataset
read is already partitioned, D3 only creates a new partition and let the
original distribution (in my case, performed by Metis) untouched. D3 is not
able to (re)partition unstructured grids (at least in my tests... or I'm
doing something wrong).

Renato.

Hi,

Is it there any way to save data from all pipeline branches without selecting them individually? Is this something that could be scripted?

Thanks in advance,

Owen.

Here's a simple script that saves all "sinks".


from paraview.simple import *

counter = 0
sources = GetSources()
for source in sources.values():
  has_consumer = False
  for i in range(0, source.GetNumberOfConsumers()):
    consumer = source.GetConsumerProxy(i)
    if consumer in sources.values():
      has_consumer = True
      print has_consumer
      break
  if not has_consumer:
    writer = CreateWriter("/tmp/foo%d.vtk" % counter, source)
    counter = counter + 1
    writer.UpdatePipeline()
    del writer

I am not sure that I follow. The output of D3 should be a dataset
re-partitioned to be load balanced whether the input is distributed or
not. Are you saying that the output of D3 is different based on
whether the input is distributed?

As expected, D3 will probably produce a different partitioning than
the input. But that shouldn't be a problem, right?

Message-ID: <50320452A334BD42A5EC72BAD21450990472E3@MBX20.d.ethz.ch>

Every night, I run the dashboard tests and get about 1000 passes and 60 fails. Some of the fails are genuine, but a hefty chunk are caused by this kind of error message caused by us using VirtualGL for remote VNC based use of the cluster,
http://cdash.cscs.ch/testDetails.php?test=241451&build=1394
most tests pass, because ctest is launched with 
vglrun ctest blah blah blah
but for reasons unknown to me, the test which pop up a colour editor dialof for example, must somehow spawn a new window without the usual vglrun config. I don't really understand - hence my post to the list

option 1 - find out why this error happens and fix it properly - please help with this if you can
option 2 - modify the ctest to ignore this particular error message, which is done for a small number of other vtk/paraview test warning/error messages. not as good as 1, but if it works, then fine.
option 3. is there something else I should know?

thanks for any advice.

JB

Hi David,
I think that your image has a 3-components data array, such as RGB.
ParaView "Gradient" filter is based on vtkImageGradient which expects
a 1-component image. You can
- convert your image in grey level with a third party software,
- use the calculator to compute a norm of the input image,
- enable the vtkImageMagnitude or vtkImageLuminance in ParaView (I
already did it here: http://github.com/jeromevelut/Peavip, but it
seems that vtkImageMagnitude needs some update...)

Subject: [Paraview] Using streamtracer/gradient filters on "multi-block"
	data set
In-Reply-To: <AANLkTinJT5MWWRZDnh25eShVPay1XL4UXhE1U5RX=TAH@mail.gmail.com>
Message-ID: <276259.67003.qm@web36505.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Not sure what you mean by that last statement -- do you mean transfer an array to pointdata? I tried to do this:

input = self.GetInput()
output = self.GetOuput()

output = vtk.vtkStructuredGrid()
output.ShallowCopy(input.GetBlock(0))

// create UVW array (3-component velocity array)

output.GetPointData().AddArray(UVWArray)

When I print output, I do see the added array in the point data section with the correct component and tuple count.? However, the bounds of the grid are suspect (like -0.1 to 0.3 for x; -0.1 to 2.6e-18 for y) and the grid extent is 0, -1, 0, -1, 0, -1.? 

I also tried:

p, li { white-space: pre-wrap; }output.GetPointData().SetVectors(UVWArray)

Didn't work either. Something is still not right here...

By any chance, does this multi-block dataset contain a block that does not have arrays (scalars and/or vectors)? That's probably why those filters are disabled. You can always use
 Extract Blocks to extract the block you are interested in and then apply the filter. As for the Programmable Filter, if you set the output type to vtkUnstructuredGrid, you should be able to do:

self.GetOutput().ShallowCopy(self.GetInput().GetBlock(0))
assuming that block 0 is a uns. grid.

Hi,

I've read in a CAS file, which Paraview read in a Multi-block dataset, which contains within it a unstructured grid.



Initially I had a problem where all of the data items were one-tuple arrays.? So I created a UVW (3-tuple velocity) array and added it to the pipeline this way using a Python programmable filter:

input?? = self.GetInput()


output = self.GetOutput()

output.ShallowCopy(input)

****create array here***
output.GetBlock(0).GetCellData().AddArray(UVWArray)

Note that "GetBlock(0)" gives me access to the grid object.? For some reason the gradients and streamtracer filters were greyed out and unavailable.? So I decided to make the output variable a vtkUnstructuredGrid instead and transferred the UVW array to it this way:




output.GetPointData().AddArray(UVWArray)

Nope...didn't work.? Any thoughts how I can modify the pipeline so that the streamtracer and gradients of unstructured data sets array can become usable? I'm guessing there is something in those classes which tells Paraview that they require certain input types. I've seen references to stuff like FillInputPortInformation. 



Thanks,
Sohail

Jerome,

That is great! Can you include it in the actual Paraview distribution?

FYI vtkImageMagnitude appears in the filters list, but vtkImageLuminance
seems to be absent. Also, when I run vtkImageMagnitude, I get:

Warning: In /home/doriad/src/ParaView/Servers/Filters/vtkTexturePainter.cxx,
line 179

vtkTexturePainter (0x8dee780): Failed to locate selected scalars. Will use
image scalars by default.


and then there is no output. The data is in an array called PNGImage of type
unsigned char with Data range [0,255],[0,255],[0,255].

Any thoughts? The file I'm trying it on is here:
http://daviddoria.com/Uploads/daveDepth.png if you want to try to reproduce.

Subject: [Paraview] Cannot read point data array
Message-ID: <20110303101853.GB16249@simba>

Hello list,

When I try to load the following file:

http://www.kuleuven-kortrijk.be/~bartv/HxHyEz_t000001.vtu

with paraview 3.8.0 on Linux Ubuntu 10.10, I get the error

ERROR: In
/home/kitware/ParaView-3-8/ParaView-3.8/ParaView/VTK/IO/vtkXMLDataReader.cxx,
line 508
vtkXMLUnstructuredGridReader (0xad48530): Cannot read point data
array "E" from PointData in piece 2.  The data array in the
element may be too short.

For as far as I can see, in Piece 2, the data array has 28
E-vectors, which is exactly the number of points I have, so I
don't see why the data array could be too short.

Another thing that I noticed is that the smallest value in Piece
2 is -2.46112e-34 which is quite close to 1.18e-38 which is the
minimum positive value for single precision (Float32).

Does anybody have an idea on what exactly is the problem with my
.vtu file and how I can solve it?

Thanks,
Bart

You can use the "macro" functionality to add python scripts are macros
and they show up in the toolbar.

I was able to load it on a 64 bit ubuntu machine with paraview built from a
couple of days (3.11) ago as well as on my 32 bit windows with paraview
built from a couple of months ago (3.9).  Can you try the 3.10rc1 release?

Subject: [Paraview] mysterious linker error for custom library in custom PV
	Plugin
Message-ID: <AANLkTinA3njQ2Unf4KnTAoNNTLFR2WWNOaPBOe02gWX4@mail.gmail.com>

I have a problem with building/linking to an external library I've called
libfio. The library builds, and I can link programs against it from the
command line. However my final plugin always comes up with a "ld: symbol(s)
not found". I have several other libraries which are linked against just
fine in my plugin, it is only this one which creates a problem.

I'm on OS X 10.6, using gcc version 4.2.1 (Apple Inc. build 5664). I have
tried building it both as a shared and static library, from both CMake and
externally (then linking from within CMake). I have several other libraries
I rely on which function perfectly well under any of the previous setups:
{shared,static} x {built within plugin cmake, built externally} x {c,cxx}.
 However with this set of .c files I always get a linking error, and it's
the same for any of the previous permutations. Under any configuration I'm
able to link against it from the command line. That is to say for the
example for a shared library built within the PV plugin CMake: libfio.dylib
is created within my build directory ParaViz_build, and doing e.g.  gcc
grafic2csv.c -lfio
-L/Users/corbett/Documents/Projects/pvaddons/ParaViz/ParaViz_build/  -o
grafic2csv has no linking errors, where grafic2csv contains the identical
code which later offends the linker within my plugin (see below for sample).

Example make output for a shared library built within the PV Plugin CMake:
...

Hi Madhura,

I can recreate this bug with my own binary but also discovered it seems to
work if the frame rate is a power of 2 (2,4,8,16,32,..). I have a feeling
something is going wrong possibly computing bit rates etc when initializing
ffmpeg. Do you mind also reporting a bug on ParaView.org/Bug.

Thanks!

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView Make Test
Message-ID: <AANLkTik_O5ggw5VVUnHyc7vU8a4BYiO95Bf8MpakZoQE@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I downloaded and attempted to build ParaView-3.10.0-RC1. I set the
PARAVIEW_DATA_ROOT to my ParaViewData-3.10.0-RC1 directory. After the build
completes, I run 'make test'. These tests fail:

184:BoxWidget
185:BoxWidget2
186:TestAffineWidget
187:TestAngleWidget2D
188:TestAngleWidget3D
189:TestBalloonWidget
190:TestBorderWidget
191:TestCameraWidget
192:TestCenteredSliderWidget2D
193:TestCheckerboardWidget
194:TestContourWidget2
195:TestDistanceWidget
196:TestHandleWidget2D
197:TestImplicitPlaneWidget
198:TestImplicitPlaneWidget2
199:TestImplicitPlaneWidget2b
200:TestLogoWidget
201:
TestOrientationMarkerWidget
202:TestPlaybackWidget
204:TestSeedWidget
205:TestSliderWidget
206:TestSliderWidget2D
207:TestTextWidget
208:TestParallelopipedWidget
209:TestSeedWidgetNonUniformRepresentations

After looking at them it seems I need to also set VTK_DATA_ROOT and
VTK_LARGE_DATA_ROOT. So I check which VTK version it comes with and I get
5.8.0. Where can I download the data for this? I only see data on the VTK
site for 5.6.1.

Thanks,

Hi Berk,

I thought D3 wouldn't repartition the data but it was my mistake. I did some
tests here and D3 worked properly, however, I was expecting that it would be
possible to remove the internal surfaces, produced by D3, with "clean to
grid" filter. I also tried to play with the "Boundary Mode" options with no
success. The internal faces are still there.

Some further comments:

I used a Xdmf reader in a temporal collection (12 time steps) of spatial
collections (4 partitions) in a small unstructured mesh. The reader loads
everything as an unique multiblock. It'll surely blows out the memory for a
larger number of time steps and/or spatial partitions (I'm copying this
message to xdmf list).

ParaView 3.10.0-RC1 does not seem robust (yet) :-(

it crashes all of a sudden and stop responding in random actions (I'll try
to list some scenarios and let my dataset available to reproduce the
errors).

The client machine is a Windows 7 x64 connected to an offscreen MPI session
with a Altix-ICE server (Linux x86_64).

[]'s

Renato.

David,
I just commited the ImageLuminance.xml in Peavip. I tried the
following pipeline with success :
Reader(daveDpeth.png) -> ImageLuminance -> Gradient

The error you get with ImageMagnitude is due to fact that some VTK
filter doesn't give a name to the output scalar. There is an old
thread on that topic -'cannot find it again, sorry-.

Finally, I won't ask to put Peavip in ParaView, as I don't think it
has sufficient quality, and enabling a lot of filters in the interface
is not a good idea. A third party GUI in which the user choose the
needed filters should be more suitable.

Hi Brad,

Thanks for the reply, I have been playing with this unsuccessfully. It 
doesn't have the desired effect so I think I'm doing something wrong.

For each executable target I have gone into the relevant CMakeLists.txt 
and added a line like:

set_target_properties(vtkpython pvtkpython PROPERTIES 
LINK_SEARCH_END_STATIC TRUE)

but i still have -Wl,-Bdynamic in the link line (by the way I was 
playing with this yesterday, and the output in the initial post was with 
LINK_SEARCH_END_STATIC TRUE). A little more confusing is that when I set 
LINK_SEARCH_END_STATIC TRUE I get Bdynamic twice where as if it's set 
FALSE I only get it once. That's the opposite of what I would have 
expected. The new Bdynamic is appearing right after a Bstatic before the 
CMAKE_C_IMPLICIT_LINK_LIBRARIES. But neither case removes the Bdyamic 
that appears in the middle of the link line. I'm pasting the output from 
each of these below so you can see what I'm talking about.

I guess 'extern "C"' is missing in the declaration of fioOpen?

Hi,

Thanks! Yes that fixed things. I was using another straight C library that
worked just fine so didn't realize this could be required.

The documentation at that link gives the explanation of why Bdynamic
appears:

  "Make uses these options to set the link type for libraries whose full
   paths are not known or (in some cases) are in implicit link directories
   for the platform. By default the linker search type is left at -Bdynamic
   by the end of the library list."

IOW any library of the form "-lfoo" is assumed to be -Bdynamic.  Libraries
in implicit link directories like "/usr/lib/libbar.a" will get turned into
"-Bstatic -lbar" but then a later "-lfoo" will become "-Bdynamic -lfoo"
since "-lfoo" is assumed to be dynamic.  This is all because CMake assumes
dynamic linking is preferred.

The solution as of CMake 2.8.4 is to ensure that all libraries are given
to target_link_libraries as full paths to the .a files so that CMake knows
they are static.  There is a TODO comment in the link computation code to
support static linking:

  http://cmake.org/gitweb?p=cmake.git;a=blob;f=Source/cmComputeLinkInformation.cxx;hb=v2.8.4#l820

I had been hoping to put in real support for a "LINK_STATIC" property that
would work with all the generators in order to resolve that TODO comment.
That is a lot of work though so it hasn't been done.

I just added a minimal feature to CMake's development version to address
the problem in this case:

  http://cmake.org/gitweb?p=cmake.git;a=commitdiff;h=5abfb571
  http://cmake.org/gitweb?p=cmake.git;a=commitdiff;h=077954d4

Now you can set a "LINK_SEARCH_START_STATIC" property to switch the dynamic
linking assumption to static linking.  In combination with "-static" that
should produce a link line with no -Bdynamic options that links statically.

This new feature should be available in the nightly builds by tomorrow:

Subject: [Paraview] CoProcessing/Client-Server Paraview
Message-ID: <4D70F961.40907@web.de>

This email was originally sent as a reply to a thread 
http://markmail.org/message/t22jsckztvnoyafz?q=Paraview started by 
Alexander. For some reason no one responded to my comments. Nevertheless 
the important question Andy Bauer raised is if Paraview is used for 
tasks that do not require the VTK pipeline (paraphrasing). To this I can 
reply and emphatic yes. I use Paraview for visualization because the VTK 
format is the only graphics file format the supports points, line, and 
surfaces and as a ready-made viewer (Paraview). Therefore my programs 
(I'm doing geometry processing) save point, line and surface data as VTK 
files and no pipeline is required -- just a viewer. What would be nice 
would be a *simple* communication mechanism with which my program can 
instruct Paraview to just load processed data as soon as they become 
available.

--------------------------------------------------------

I'd like to know the difference between CoProcessing and the following 
feature that is currently being implemented:

http://paraview.uservoice.com/forums/11350-general/suggestions/456005-writing-to-paraview-from-an-external-program?ref=title
(an ETA on this feature would be nice)

 From a cursory glance and my experience with other 3d apps (namely 
AutoDesk Maya) I find the current CoProcessing(?) implementation a bit 
too complicated.

AutoDesk Maya, a highend 3d animation program, has a commandPort feature 
that very simple to use. All it requires is a single command that 
creates a socket and binds a specified port number to it. Thereafter any 
external app can send commands to Maya in its primary scripting language 
(MEL) and I suspect now also python. For example, I've configured my 
toolchain/IDE (Visual Studio) to send Maya a command, via the 
commandPort channel, to unload plugins before attempting to rebuild 
them. After building the toolchain/IDE sends another command to Maya 
asking it to reload the plugin. Basically, any scripting command that 
Maya accepts can be sent by and external app via the commandPort.

http://download.autodesk.com/us/maya/2011help/CommandsPython/commandPort.html

Can communication between Paraview and external apps be made this simple?

Subject: [Paraview] Reader Properties
Message-ID: <BFC6F607797EE4439A63CAC7BC43A1D1017C77@EXCHMBX01.fed.cclrc.ac.uk>

I have a plugin object panel which I associate with a plugin reader. From my object panel I can access vtkSMProperty objects:

vtkSMProperty * sizeProperty =  this->proxy()->GetProperty("SizeProperty");

The line above will give me the default value set for the property. What I really want to be able to do is take a value read in from the file and pass it on to my object panel. How can I set property information in such a way that it can be picked up from the object panel?

Thanks in advance.

Make the  "SizeProperty" and information_only property with the right
type of  "InformationHelper" sepecified in teh XML. Then in your
object panel you can call vtkSMProxy::UpdatePropertyInformation() and
the access the value for the property.

Subject: [Paraview] Once more: ParaView Live Data
Message-ID: <4D710C76.7090008@gmx.de>

Hey,

first of all I want to apologize to come up with this question again. 
There are already  a lot of (outdated) threads about this subject. 
However, I could not find out whether the new CoProcessing plugin will 
provide the (simple) function I am searching for.

I need a live data function similar to this description:
http://batchmake.org/Wiki/Animating_Live_Data

I am running a simulation that creates PNG files at fixed timesteps. The 
result should be a live animation of the simulation PNGs in a ParaView 
instance on the same computer (no pvserver).

Can this be done with the new CoProcessing plugin? If not, what are my 
current options?


Kind regards,
Daniel Molloy

Message-ID: <C996702D.81EA%reuterma@ornl.gov>

Hi,

I'm trying to get the DIY application up and running. I have successfully got it to compile and run, but it doesn't seem to do anything when loading the sample data. At first I thought that it was due to not having a running server before loading the file, so I created a server instance, connected the client and then loaded the data again. In spite of this, nothing shows up on the screen and none of the drop down boxes show anything interesting. I'm not receiving any error messages from the program. I can load the sample data into ParaView just fine. Is there a debug flag I can set or pass to the DIY program to get some information about what is going on?  I am running on 64-bit Ubuntu with a git copy of ParaView.

Thanks,
Michael

Hi David,

Many thanks for you suggestions. I was away for a while but had some time to
look at this points this week again. The using the Python calculator brought
me on the trail of using The Programmable Pythonscript filter.

My quest: I want to extrate the minimum value and its position for a time
series of VTK files and write the data for all the time step to one single
file.

With the advice so for, I now have the following construction.

First I read a series of VTK files representating the velocity over a cross
section

*U_pxy_z0_600_t0 = LegacyVTKReader( FileNames=[ List of filename ])*

Then I extract the U_z velocity component

*Calculator2 = Calculator()
Calculator2.AttributeMode = 'point_data'
Calculator2.Function = 'U_Z'
Calculator2.ResultArrayName = 'U_Z'


*Then I create a Programmable Filter

ProgrammableFilter2 = ProgrammableFilter()

ProgrammableFilter2.RequestUpdateExtentScript = ''
ProgrammableFilter2.PythonPath = ''
ProgrammableFilter2.RequestInformationScript = ''
ProgrammableFilter2.OutputDataSetType = 'vtkTable'
ProgrammableFilter2.Script = 'blabla'


For the script of the Programmable filter, I am now doing the following

  input=inputs[0]

Uzdata= input.PointData['U_Z']

numPoints = input.GetNumberOfPoints()

uzmin=Uzdata[0]

for i in range(numPoints):

uz=Uzdata[i]

if uz<uzmin:

minpos=input.GetPoint(i)

uzmin=uz

print "uzmin: ",uzmin,min(Uzdata)

print "minpos: ",minpos

output.RowData.append(uzmin, 'uzmin')

*
*At this point I am stuck. First of all, the minpos variable is a tuple, and
I don't know how to apend this to the output.RowData, because it needs to be
and vtkArray. What is the way to convert a tuple into a vtkArray?

Second of all: if I step over the time step and see correctly the minpos and
uzmin value updated in the spreadsheet viewer. However, how can I collect
all the values into one array and then write to a single file ? Or should I
just write the data of each time step to a seperate file ?

Hopefully someone can give me some advice on how to approach this issue.

Many thanks in advance!

Regards,

Eelco

Is it possible to share you code? Pretty sure you are missing an
equivalent of "accept" somewhere.

Hi Utkarsh,

 I'm running the code that is given on the ParaView wiki:
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/IEEE_Vis10_DIY_Vis_Application_-_ParaView,
specifically for the QuickContour example. I get similar behavior from the
SimpleApp example. I have made no modifications to the code.

Cheers,

Ah, looks like there was a bug that got introduced in git-master. I've
committed a fix. Attached is a patch for the same.

Subject: [Paraview] CoProcessing/Client-Server Paraview

The paraview coprocessor allows a code developer to embed paraview services
(pipelines & visualizations) into their program.  It is a different concept
that controlling a paraview gui from a command port.

If you want a way to control paraview from a command port, you'd have two
options:

* paraview waits for a command to arrive on the command port.  The paraview
gui is frozen while it waits
* write a paraview qt plugin that introduces a command port thread.  Use
qt's thread-safe signal slot connections to signal the paraview gui when a
new command arrives on the command port.

Both of these options requires that somebody writes new code, these options
are not currently available in paraview.  For the first option, someone
could implement it quite trivially using just a python script and the
python's socket support.  The commands that an external program sends to
paraview command port could be python strings that paraview executes in the
python console.

Thanks Marion.

Perhaps the developers would consider a Paraview command port. A frozen 
GUI in the first option is not particularly appealing.

OK but why would LINK_SEARCH_END_STATIC result in "-Wl,-Bstatic 
-Wl,-Bdynamic" being used ? Shouldn't it be just "-Bstatic" ?

Why is CMake's default to make a substitution like "-lfoo" with 
"-Bdynamic -lfoo" ? It seems like this choice is unnecessarily 
complicating things. It's also often redundant (as long as you don't 
want to mix static and dynamic linking) because without this ld defaults 
to using shared libraries. These substitutions override what's set in 
CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS making that pretty much useless. It would be 
useful to be able to turn off these substitutions, then the "-static" in 
CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS would work.

I wondering if the LINK_SEARCH_*_STATIC issues are sidetracking us, 
because there's one instance of -Bdynamic appearing in the middle of the 
link line (below), and it's not affected by LINK_SEARCH_*_STATIC. I have 
no idea where it's coming from but it's presence is related to enabling 
python support because otherwise pv links statically fine. By the way 
this is a statically linked build of python.

Thank you Brad! I tried the new feature and I still have a -Bdynamic 
appearing in the middle of the link line at "../../bin/libhdf5.a 
-Wl,-Bdynamic -lm ../../bin/libvtkPVCommandOptions.a", full link line 
from the LINK_SEARCH_START_STATIC build follows.

Fabian,

I don't know but I don't mind either. I use my workaround mentioned
below without any problems so far. The only limitation it has is it is
only woking with multi-block datasets of dimension one (Ensight-Reader,
some_wall_name) but not with the parallel OpenFOAM reader (Dimension
two: Patches -> some_wall_name). I have no solution for this so far.

Regards Bastian

Subject: [Paraview] PNG time series problems?
Message-ID: <4D74F7BD.506@gmx.de>

Hello ML,

I need to create an animation from a series of PNG files. In the "Open 
File" dialog this series is displayed as a group that I can choose to 
load. However, once opened, I cannot play an animation - the first image 
is the only one visible; and the group is not listed in the "Time" field 
in the "Information" tab.

What am I doing wrong? It is kind of urgent, any help is appreciated.


Kind regards,
Daniel Molloy

Hi Daniel,

Could you post which version of paraview you are using?

Never mind. If I would actually _read_ the error message I could figure it out. Seems I got something mucked up when switching from master to release. Seems to configure and build now.
 Sorry for the noise.

Hi Pat,

Hi Bart,

Please reply to the email list so that other's can benefit as well as
contribute to the discussion.

As for the save animation issue, I'm not familiar enough with that but maybe
someone else will be able to comment.

Oops... sorry, I totally agree that it is better to reply to the
list (see also my signature ;-) but somehow I must've forgot or
pressed the wrong button in my email client.

I found a solution after reading David Partyka's answer on the
mailinglist:

http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2011-March/020410.html

Apparently, also for me, it works if the number of frames per
second is a power of 2.  For now, I can live with this workaround
:-)

Kind regards,
Bart

You can read the logic in cmComputeLinkInformation.cxx to figure this out.

The default assumption is dynamic linking but if one specifies a full
path to a static library like /usr/lib/libm.a then it switches to -Bstatic
to pick that up with "-lm" and then back to -Bdynamic.  Static linking
was not a goal at the time that stuff was written.

I think the only way that can happen now is if you actually pass a ".so"
file to target_link_libraries (assuming LINK_SEARCH_START_STATIC is on)
that is in /usr/lib or another system directory.  Check your CMakeCache
for such entries.

Really want to control things then bring all external libraries in as
IMPORTED targets and set the IMPORTED_LOCATION property to point at the
full path to the exact file you want.

Subject: [Paraview] Data average on a surface
Message-ID: <201103081327.p28DRuaS015147@relay-auth.mailprotect.be>

Hi,

I am a new paraview user, and have a quite simple question about it.
I have a cfd simulation of an air flow, let's say just walls+inlet+outlet. I
exported the converged result as an Ensight file, to read it with paraview, and
it works fine.
I just would like to know if it is easily possible to select my outlet, and ask
paraview to compute, for example, the average velocity magnitude on that face ?
I guess I should use something like the "integrate variables" filter, but how do
I select that outlet face (which is defined in my CFD program, but doesn't seem
available in paraview...) ?

Thank you,

Arnaud

I have an id table, for example, id= 4 = outflow.
Then I
1) extract a surface
2) connectivity

When using the ensight reader it whould be possible to use the "extract
block" filter to extract the outet and run "integrate variables" filters
on the extracted outlet.

Hello Stephen,

I have the same problem.

I use SALOME to produce mesh, in which I define groups for CFD
solvers, such as Code_Saturne or Elmer. Thereby, I don't know the ID
values which correspond to the different boundaries. What software do
you use?

Thanks for your advices.

Best regards,
Wayne

I do have LINK_SEARCH_START_STATIC TRUE. I do see a ton of .so all are 
related to x11, but I have VTK_USE_X=OFF. No libm.so in the Cache 
though.  I guess this might be some unexpected interaction between PV's 
cmake scripts and cmake's linking logic. It only happens when python 
support is enabled. I'm using PV 3.8.1. Dave DeMarle said he didn't have 
this problem with a "recent" version of PV, and also that he's working 
on officially supporting static link with python for release 3.10.1.

The Cray's do support dynamic linking , although it looks like there is 
a performance penalty at least during startup, I'm going to take that 
route since it works, and won't be too long until static linking + 
python is officially supported.

Thanks for the help

Subject: [Paraview] Message to anyone who has recently built/purchased a
	workstation for paraview use.
Message-ID: <41F85D43-3DF7-4774-A351-4CA83BEBFE61@gmail.com>

Hi,

we intend to purchase a workstation before end of financial year for the primary use of paraview 3D data rendering (fusion energy research).  If anyone has done similar in the last few months, I'd be very interested to know what you recommend for between ?4K (GBP) and ?6K.

We have been quoted ?6.5K for a top end CAD workstation with dual 6-core CPUs, 24GB of RAM and a top end 6GB CAD level NVIDIA GPU.  My main worry is that for a single machine paraview setup with a single GPU whether the code can exploit the potential 24 hyperthreads of the CPUs - would it be better just to go for a single dual or quad core CPU and spend the money instead on a decent fast, large volume RAID setup and the fastest GPU we can get our hands on?

Or, is it possible to set up paraview to use MPI (assuming it doesn't deploy openMP) on a single machine with multiple cores but with multiple "cheaper" GPUs and in the end get better performance?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated,

Rob.

Subject: [Paraview] pqViewManager in Clone2
Message-ID: <AANLkTimO4dunmXEKKjouwh6v60798hd-zzduPVm6o1-L@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

 I tried to use the recommended method below in my ParaView plugin:



 // Get Application Core
  pqApplicationCore* core = pqApplicationCore::instance();

  // Get Object Builder to create new Views, Server etc
  pqObjectBuilder* builder = core->getObjectBuilder();

  // Get the Server Manager Model so that we can get current server

  pqServerManagerModel* serverManager = core->getServerManagerModel();

  if (serverManager->getNumberOfItems<pqServer*>()== 1) // Assuming
that there is only 1 server

  {
	  pqServer* server = serverManager->getItemAtIndex<pqServer*>(0);

	  if (serverManager->getNumberOfItems<pqView*> () == 1) // Assuming
that there is only 1 view created
	  {
		  pqView* view1 = serverManager->getItemAtIndex<pqView*>(0);

		
		  // Get QWidget from first view

		  QWidget* viewWidget = view1->getWidget();
		  //Create GridLayout Widget from first view's widget
		  QGridLayout* gl  = new QGridLayout(viewWidget);

                                  //create second view

		  pqRenderView* view2 = qobject_cast<pqRenderView*>(
	                  builder->createView(pqRenderView::renderViewType(), server));
                                  //Add second view's widget to gridlayout


		  gl->addWidget(view2->getWidget(),1,1);

		  //Create third view
		
                                   //create third view
		  pqRenderView* view3 = qobject_cast<pqRenderView*>(
	                  builder->createView(pqRenderView::renderViewType(), server));


                                  //Add third view's widget to gridlayout
	                   gl->addWidget(view3->getWidget(),2,2);
	  }
  }

The debugger fails at
pqRenderView* view3 = qobject_cast<pqRenderView*>(
	                  builder->createView(pqRenderView::renderViewType(), server));

pqObjectBuilder.cxx : pxm->RegisterProxy("views", name.toAscii().data(), proxy);
qwidget.h: inline QSize QWidget::size() const { return data->crect.size(); }

because data is null.


name.toAscii is "RenderView3".

Can someone let me know what I mess up in the code? Thanks.

I guess that depends on how the sphere is represented in your CFD mesh.  Is there a "hole" in your CFD mesh where the sphere is that you cannot see when you render the mesh?  Or does the mesh go through the sphere, and is there some implicit field that defines where the sphere is?

No, Xdmf is not a plugin in ParaView, although, a developer can easily
disable it, we don;t provide any options to the user so far to disable
using Xdmf. Any particular reason why you want to disable Xdmf?

Subject: [Paraview]  Plugin with own thread
Message-ID: <001e01cbde74$75d38480$617a8d80$@Rogge@tu-cottbus.de>

Hello,

 

after reading the tutorials and How-to's for writing ParaView Plugins I've
started with the Autostart-Example project. My goal was to create a plugin
which is executed in an external thread. It might happens that I need this
in the near future. 

 

Well, it works quit well, I guess. But to avoid some errors and
miss-behaviors I need a confirmation that I am on the right way.

 

My approach is to use the signal-slot-pattern to communicate between the
main thread of ParaView and my own plugin-thread. The class
pqMyApplicationStarter represents the ParaView-plugin (which is running in
the main thread of ParaView?). There is an object in this class which
executes a loop within an external thread ( class Thread ), which extends
QThread. 

 

As I read somewhere that vtk isn't implemented threaded-safe at all (at
least the rendering stuff) I decided to do all render calls in
pqMyApplicationStarter. When the UpdatedData()signal is fired the active
view needs to re-rendered. 

 

The question I want to ask is very simple: Is this the right / best way to
create a thread and communicate with it via signals?

 

 

/////////////// Thread.h ////////////////////////////

class Thread : public QThread

{

Q_OBJECT

public:

Thread(QObject* parent = 0);

virtual ~Thread();

virtual void run();

signals:

      void UpdatedData();

};

 

 

 

void Thread::run()

{

      running = true;

 

      while( running )

      {

// Sleep awhile

            msleep( 800 );

            // Fire the signal

            emit UpdatedData();                      

      }                 

}

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////

 

 

/////////////// pqMyApplicationStarter //////////////

class pqMyApplicationStarter : public QObject

{

      Q_OBJECT

      typedef QObject Superclass;

 

public:

      pqMyApplicationStarter(QObject* p=0);

      ~pqMyApplicationStarter();

 

      // Callback for startup.

      void onStartup();

 

public slots:

      void Trigger();

};

 

 

 

void pqMyApplicationStarter::onStartup()

{

      myThread = new Thread();

      myThread->start();

 

      pqActiveObjects::instance().connect( myThread, SIGNAL(UpdatedData()),
this, SLOT(Trigger()) );            

}

 

void pqMyApplicationStarter::Trigger()

{     

      pqActiveObjects* object = &(pqActiveObjects::instance());

      pqView* view            = object->activeView();

 

      if (view)

      {

            view->render();

      }

 

      view  = NULL;

}

 

 

Thanks a lot.

 

Cheers,

If you can post your code on github or gitorious, it might be easier
to debug. It's not clear why you;d be getting that error.

You might want to read
http://doc.qt.nokia.com/latest/threads-qobject.html especially the
section about signal/slots and threads.

In your code, contrary to what you expect, Trigger() is being called
in your thread and not the "main thread" and hence the issues you
might be seeing. If you simply change the connection to use a
Qt::QueuedConnection you'd get the desired effect.

For one I build HDF5 with the 1.6 API which I think Xdmf has issues with. Being able to disable Xdmf (as I used to be able to do) would be important for myself.

Subject: [Paraview] Pvbatch with XDMF/HDF5 limitation
Message-ID: <1299689074.9285.5134.camel@hokuto>

Please, is it possible for someone to try to reproduce the behavior of
which I am talking about with the example files submitted here:
http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=10702 ?

If I try to open for example the file unsteady_output_probe_1.xdmf
passing 1, 2, 4, 8 or 16 cpu's to mpirun when starting the pvserver
there are no problems, but with 3, 5, 6, 7, 9 .. 15 the client hangs. 

I would appreciate any hint of information about this problem.

Hi

Here's the file:
https://github.com/alexisylchan/ParaView/blob/testTwoViews/Plugins/VRPN/pqVRPNStarter.cxx

I commented out the last view creation. Now ParaView can load the plugin and
create a second window but it's not a functional view. (See
screenshot<http://cs.unc.edu/%7Ealexisc/ParaView/twowindows.png>
)

Thanks!!

Subject: [Paraview] ANN: ParaView 3.10.0 Available for download.
Message-ID: <AANLkTikKuqN2xNS1H4udOnF3pCmtztohd9_6OZ=UYfv3@mail.gmail.com>

Hello All,

The ParaView team is pleased to announce the availability of the ParaView
3.10.0 final binaries for download on the ParaView download page.

http://paraview.org/paraview/resources/software.html

Release Notes:

ParaView 3.10

This release features notable developments, including mechanisms to
incorporate advanced rendering techniques, improved support for readers and
several usability enhancements and bug fixes.

For the 3.10 release,  we have added 60 new readers. The new readers
include: ANSYS, CGNS, Chombo, Dyna3D, Enzo, Mili, Miranda, Nastran, Pixie,
Samrai, Silo, and Tecplot Binary. A full listing of supported readers can be
found in the ParaView Users Guide. We also added the ability for developers
to create ParaView reader plugins from previously developed VisIt reader
plugins. You can find a full guide on how to do this on the VisIt Database
Bridge: http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/VisIt_Database_Bridge

With this release we have rewritten the ParaView User's Guide and are making
it freely available for the first time. The complete guide can be obtained
in the help system or online at:
http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Users_Guide/Table_Of_Contents.

We have included a Python-based calculator which makes it possible to write
operations using Python. The Python calculator uses NumPy, which lets you
use advanced functions such as gradients, curls, and divergence easily in
expressions. Also the NumPy module is packaged in the ParaView binary and is
importable from the ParaView Python shell.

There should also be a marked performance improvement for users dealing with
large multi-block datasets. We have cleaned up the rendering pipeline to
better handle composite datasets, avoiding the appending of all blocks into
a single dataset as was done previously.

To better utilize multiple cores on modern multi-core machines, by default
ParaView can now run using a parallel server, even for the built-in mode.
This enables the use of all the cores for parallel data processing, without
requiring the user to start a parallel server. ParaView binaries will also
be distributed using an MPI implementation, making this feature available to
users by simply downloading the binaries. Since this is an experimental
feature, it is off by default, but users can turn it on by checking the
Auto-MPI checkbox in the application settings dialog.

Additionally, the 3.10 release includes several usability enhancements. 3D
View now supports smart context menus, accessed by right-clicking on any
object in the 3D View to change its color, representation, color map and
visibility. Left-clicking on an object in the 3D View makes it active in the
pipeline browser. Within the spreadsheet view, sorting is now supported and
an advanced parallel sorting algorithm ensures that none of the benefits of
the spreadsheet view, such as streaming and selection, are sacrificed.
Python tracing and macro controls are no longer hidden on the Python shell
dialog and instead are now easily found on the Tools menu.

For developers interested in adding support for advanced multi-pass
rendering algorithms to ParaView, this release includes a major refactoring
of ParaView's rendering pipeline. View and representations have been
redesigned and users should see improved performance in client-server mode
from reduced interprocess communication during rendering.

LANL's MantaView interactive ray tracing plugin has been restructured to
make it easier to use. Version 2.0 of the plugin is now multi-view capable
and no longer requires ParaView to be run in a client/server configuration.
Similarly both of LANL's streaming aware ParaView derived applications have
been merged into ParaView proper in the form of a new View plugin. The
underlying streaming algorithms have been rewritten to be more usable and
extensible. Both plugins are available in standard binary package for the
first time in this release.

For an exhaustive list of the new features and bug-fixes, please refer to
the change log at: http://www.paraview.org/Bug/changelog_page.php.

As always, we rely on your feedback to make ParaView better. Please use
http://paraview.uservoice.com/ or click on the "Tell us what you think" link
on paraview.org to leave your feedback and vote for new features.

Subject: [Paraview] Using streamtracer/gradient filters on "multi-block"
	data set
In-Reply-To: <276259.67003.qm@web36505.mail.mud.yahoo.com>
Message-ID: <338314.10920.qm@web36504.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hi,

So the reason why my required filters are greyed out after loading this CAS data set is due to a few lines in the XML file.? The streamtracer is an example:

???????? <DataTypeDomain name="input_type" composite_data_supported="1">
??????????? <DataType value="vtkDataSet"/>
????????? </DataTypeDomain>
????????? <InputArrayDomain name="input_array" attribute_type="point"
??????????????????????????? number_of_components="3"/>

Now I did introduce a "vtkStructuredGrid" into the pipeline, which inherits from vtkDtaSet, so that shouldn't be a problem with the "DataType" portion above.? But what concerns me the "InputArrayDomain" requirement.? By default the data set loads in a bunch of 1-component arrays.? I thought that by creating the 3-component UVW array (see below), I wouldn't face any issues.? But for some reason I still do -- maybe that requirement is unfulfilled?

If anyone has any ideas, please let me know.

Sohail

Not sure what you mean by that last statement -- do you mean transfer an array to pointdata? I tried to do this:

input = self.GetInput()
output = self.GetOuput()

output = vtk.vtkStructuredGrid()
output.ShallowCopy(input.GetBlock(0))

// create UVW array (3-component velocity array)

output.GetPointData().AddArray(UVWArray)

When I print output, I do see the added array in the point data section with the correct component and tuple count.? However, the bounds of the grid are suspect (like -0.1 to 0.3 for x; -0.1 to 2.6e-18 for y) and the grid extent is 0, -1, 0, -1, 0, -1.? 

I also tried:

#yiv1702808980 p, #yiv1702808980 li {white-space:pre-wrap;}output.GetPointData().SetVectors(UVWArray)

Didn't work either. Something is still not right here...

I looks like you to apply cell data to point data.

Let me correct myself; the block contained inside is a vtkStructuredGrid.? I did a printout what is in the pipeline (self.GetInput()):

By any chance, does this multi-block dataset contain a block that does not have arrays (scalars and/or vectors)? That's probably why those filters are disabled. You can always use
 Extract Blocks to extract the block you are interested in and then apply the filter. As for the Programmable Filter, if you set the output type to vtkUnstructuredGrid, you should be able to do:

self.GetOutput().ShallowCopy(self.GetInput().GetBlock(0))
assuming that block 0 is a uns. grid.

Hi,

I've read in a CAS file, which Paraview read in a Multi-block dataset, which contains within it a unstructured grid.



Initially I had a problem where all of the data items were one-tuple arrays.? So I created a UVW (3-tuple velocity) array and added it to the pipeline this way using a Python programmable filter:

input?? = self.GetInput()


output = self.GetOutput()

output.ShallowCopy(input)

****create array here***
output.GetBlock(0).GetCellData().AddArray(UVWArray)

Note that "GetBlock(0)" gives me access to the grid object.? For some reason the gradients and streamtracer filters were greyed out and unavailable.? So I decided to make the output variable a vtkUnstructuredGrid instead and transferred the UVW array to it this way:




output.GetPointData().AddArray(UVWArray)

Nope...didn't work.? Any thoughts how I can modify the pipeline so that the streamtracer and gradients of unstructured data sets array can become usable? I'm guessing there is something in those classes which tells Paraview that they require certain input types. I've seen references to stuff like FillInputPortInformation. 



Thanks,
Sohail

Subject: [Paraview] String Drop Down XML
Message-ID: <AANLkTinUDjse+8mbEEfu4Wc-MfdwKAV_pHxwidq0xmy3@mail.gmail.com>

I can't seem to figure out how to make a drop down list with strings from a
reader. I have created a drop down list with integers, and I have read that
it was possible, but I can't figure out what I need to implement. If any one
has any good examples (XML and C++) that would be great.

If I have this:
[code]
            <StringVectorProperty name="CellArrayInfo"

            <StringVectorProperty name="CellArrayStatus"
                command="SetCellArrayStatus"
                number_of_elements="0"

                element_types="2 0"

                label="Cell Arrays">

                </ArraySelectionDomain>
            </StringVectorProperty>
[/code]

I read that I could change:
[code]
                number_of_elements="0"
                repeat_command="1" number_of_elements_per_command="2"
[/code]

to
[code]
                number_of_elements="1"
[/code]

but that does not work.

I also tried using the EnumerationDomain with IntVectorProperty. This will
only give me a dropdown with integers.

Note: I'm not looking for this:
[code]
<EnumerationDomain name="enum">
          <Entry text="Stuff" value="0" />
           ....
[/code]

If I am not able to do a dropdown with a string, is there a way to only
allow one item to be selected in my first sample of xml?

Thanks,
Brian

Nevermind. I figured it out.

I can use something similar to this:
[code]
            <StringVectorProperty
                name="PhaseNameInfo"
                command="GetPhaseList"
                information_only="1">
                <StringArrayHelper />
            </StringVectorProperty>
            <StringVectorProperty
                name="PhaseName"
                command="SetPhase"
                number_of_elements="1">
                <StringListDomain name="operation">
                    <RequiredProperties>
                        <Property name="PhaseNameInfo"
                            function="ArraySelection"/>
                    </RequiredProperties>
                </StringListDomain>
            </StringVectorProperty>
[/code]

and have two functions:
[code]
    void SetPhase(const char* phase);
    vtkStringArray* GetPhaseList();
[/code]

This seems to work.

Subject: [Paraview] Plugin with own thread
Message-ID: <000801cbdefe$189b1ff0$49d15fd0$@Rogge@tu-cottbus.de>

Hello Utkarsh,

thank you very much for the quick response and thanks for pointing me
on the QThread documentation. Regarding to the QT doc I realized a 
direct connection here, which leads to an immediately processing of 
Trigger().

Well, my assumption was indeed wrong. So I went back to my code and 
include some debug outputs to clarify which thread processes the 
pqMyApplicationStarter::Trigger() method. In order to get these 
information I output the current thread Ids of my plugin (in 
onStartup and Trigger) ...

	void pqMyApplicationStarter::onStartup()
	{	
		...
		qWarning() << "Message from pqMyApplicationStarter: 
			Application Started 
			(" << this->thread()->currentThreadId() << ")";

	}

	void pqMyApplicationStarter:: Trigger()
	{	
		...
		qWarning() << "pqMyApplicationStarter::Trigger(): 
			" <<  this->thread()->currentThreadId();

	}

and in my external thread (Thread::run).

	void Thread::run()
	{
		running = true;	

		while( running )
		{		
			qWarning() << "Thread::run(): " <<
currentThreadId();
	
			// Fire the signal
			emit UpdatedData();		

			qWarning() << "Invocation done";
		}	
	}

This lead to the following output:

	Message from pqMyApplicationStarter: Application Started ( 0x1514 ) 
	Thread::run():                      0x123c 
	pqMyApplicationStarter::Trigger():  0x1514 
	Invocation done

And here I a new question arises: It seems to be, that Trigger is 
invoked in my external thread and waits for return but is processed
in the plugin thread. Is that right?


Thanks again,

Best regards,
Stephan

You might want to read
http://doc.qt.nokia.com/latest/threads-qobject.html especially the
section about signal/slots and threads.

In your code, contrary to what you expect, Trigger() is being called
in your thread and not the "main thread" and hence the issues you
might be seeing. If you simply change the connection to use a
Qt::QueuedConnection you'd get the desired effect.

Hi David,
I may be wrong, but I think that sources are filters without input.
Thus you don't need
anything else than the <ProxyGroup name="sources"> you put in the XML.

Hello all.

I've tried the CGNS reader included in the PV 3.10.0 final release with 
several example from the CGNS site 
http://cgns.sourceforge.net/CGNSFiles.html (delta.cgns, 
delta_vertex.cgns) and also with my own CGNS files and I always get an 
error:

Hi Richard, which linux binary are you having problems with, 64 bit I
presume? I tested with a couple of the files from
http://cgns.sourceforge.net/CGNSFiles.html. Let me try and recreate the
problem.

Hi Dave.

Yes, I used the Linux 64 bits binaries. Not yet tested with 32 bits. 
Thank you for your interest.

Same error with Linux 32 bit binaries.

Hi Richard,

I think I found the problem. CGNS, for the linux binaries, were built with
hdf5 support enabled, which appears to be broken. After rebuilding cgns
without hdf5 support I am able to load delta.cgns and multi.cgns. I have
repackaged the binaries, re-tested and uploaded them. Please give it a try
and let me know.

I also went and re-tested the Windows and Mac binaries with CGNS data and
they all work fine. Thank you for your patience!

Hi Dave.

I re-downloaded the Linux 64 bit binaries and now I can read the CGNS 
examples delta.cgns, delta_certex.cgns and multi.cgns. Thank you very much.

But I can't get the CGNS reader working with PV 3.10.0 Windows 32 bit on 
Vista home edition SP2 : PV crashes each time I select a cgns file! I 
did not re-download the Windows binaries. Did you also re-package them?

Richard.

Is there a git tag or branch to go with this release? I just want to be sure I checkout the proper sources. I guess I could just download the source tarball from the website.

Thanks

Version 2.0 of the plugin is now multi-view capable and no longer requires ParaView to be run in a client/server configuration.

The underlying streaming algorithms have been rewritten to be more usable and extensible. Both plugins are available in standard binary package for the first time in this release.

Subject: [Paraview] Image color map
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=zVsexbcK2EAFGVcoePtkYen627BfLDvdRZChF@mail.gmail.com>

When looking at this file:

http://www.rpi.edu/~doriad/Paraview_List/appended.mhd
http://www.rpi.edu/~doriad/Paraview_List/appended.raw

with Color by: MetaImage -> 3 (the 4th channel of the image), I only see two
colors, red and blue. If I look at the file in the spreadsheet view, the 4th
channel values vary continuously from 0 to 7. I have clicked Rescale to Data
Range with no change.

Can anyone reproduce this? Or am I just doing something wrong? I just pulled
from master.

Thanks,

David

If you look at http://doc.qt.nokia.com/latest/qobject.html#thread

you'll see that QObject::thread() returns the thread to which the
object belongs, not the thread in which the code is being executed.

I replied prematurely without realizing the currentThreadId() is a
static method. So have you changed the "connect" to use a queued
connection or not?

I seem to see the different shades just fine. If you are talking about
the shades being just red and blue, that's the default lookup table,
change the lookup table to rainbow if that's what you are expecting by
clicking "Edit color map".

With 3.10.0 on windows just works fine. If in 'Edit Color Map' Resolution is
> 2 and you still see only 2 colors then there might be something
wrong which I don't know unfortunately.

Good luck!

Sorry, I should have attached a screenshot from the beginning:

What you have attached is indeed what I am looking for.

Hom - Resolution is set to the default of 256.

There was a big discussion on this on the qt-interest mailing list back in December I think. Basically a QThread "manages" a native thread on the operating system but does NOT reside on that thread itself.
 Rather than trying to explain it I'll refer you to one of the Authors of the QThread class and how HE says it should be done.

Subject: [Paraview] vtkTable
Message-ID: <AANLkTikq-dpAKFajjnj33SiAAVHAoStz=MpyFZXcPrzW@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I would like to have some more information on vtkTable and
ProgrammableFilters. Hopefully anybody can sent me some examples orso. I
already posted before: my quest is to loop over data plane time steps,
extract the location of the minimum value, and then write all those location
to file. This really should not be that difficult, but it is if you don't
have enough documentation. Is there anybody with an example ?

Thanks

Eelco

It indeed seems to be scaled 0 to 7. I have updated the screenshot to
include the color bar: http://rpi.edu/~doriad/Paraview_List/screenshot.jpg

I could reproduce your figure if I rescale from 0 to 1. Therefore, If you
plot the colorbar is it really scaled 0 to 7?

We have an inhouse university unstructured software named aironum. I 
simply added a table id(ns) with id= 0 at interior points and a 
different value for each boundary condition.
I test for x = xmin (rectangular exterior boundaries case) and set id = 
5 (my inflow identifier). Saturn is an open source code so you could add 
it rather easy.
Hope this helps a little, if not, ask more questions.

Try running paraview with -dr.
I once saw something similar happen where a user had something go
wrong in the app settings file.

Hi,

We're trying to use the 64bit binary of 3.10 to load an XDMF file, but it segfaults as soon as we click on open.

Also, I requested this before and somebody replied and said it was done, but the 3.10 release doesn't have it -- Can it be built with XDMF_WRAP_PYTHON turned on? That's the only thing that makes us have to build from source rather than use the binaries.

Thanks,

Tim

I have two drop down menus in the Object Inspector's Properties tab. The

Apply. I know it can be done with pqPropertyLinks, but I'm not sure how to

The correct way for doing this is to use domains and "required"
properties for the domains. However the questions is can the values in
drop-down #2 be determined without pushing the value chosen by the
user for drop-down #1 to the server/VTK-object?

Hi Tim,

Unfortunately, XDMF_WRAP_PYTHON got disabled last minute because it currently
prevents being able to run things like
   cpack -G TGZ --config Applications/ParaView/CPackParaViewConfig.cmake

See

Hi,

I'd just like to point out an issue with 3.10.0-RC1.

I have a volume data set of a mouse which works fine in 3.8. I've just tried
it in 3.10.0-RC1 on both Linux and Windows and I see the top and bottom of
the mouse being clipped. If I switch to GPU the clipping disappears.

Attached is a screenshot showing the left and right data missing. 

Sometimes when it is first loaded it is complete but any movement makes it
clip.

I tried both a *.vti file of the data and loading it again as *.raw with the
same results.

Cheers,

Paul

Is it possible to share the data? If not, what are the data bounds
(look on the information tab)?

Bummer about XDMF_WRAP_PYTHON, but not a huge deal.

The bigger problem is the seg fault when loading XDMF datasets. I'd be happy to give data to replicate the problem if nobody else is seeing the issue.

Hi Tim,

Unfortunately, XDMF_WRAP_PYTHON got disabled last minute because it currently
prevents being able to run things like
   cpack -G TGZ --config Applications/ParaView/CPackParaViewConfig.cmake

See

Tim,

That'd be great. You can send it directly to me too if you dont want
to post it to the mailing list or it's too big for it.

I wanted to see if an older version of Paraview would display my image
correctly. I downloaded 3.10 from here (linux x86 32bit:
http://paraview.org/paraview/resources/software.html). When I run it, I get:

Thoughts?

What Linux distro is this? libswscale is from ffmpeg. I am not certain why
it would give that error though.

Also, is your linux distro infact 64bit? If so have you tried the 64bit
binary instead?

That's very odd. I cannot seem to reproduce this. See my attached pic.
It's with fixed point volume rendering.
Is this client-server or something like that?

Hi,

I compiled ParaView 3.10 without problems on the university cluster but get the following error message when running cpack to create the tarball. I get a lot of the libstdc++.so.6: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.9' not found messages after which cpack finishes. Paraview seems to run fine from the build directory so it is no problem for me but it could be for other users.

I can confirm that PV 10.0 (Linux 64bit binaries) crashes upon opening XDMF files. The sample file quoted below suffices to reproduce the problem. I also note that the very same file was loaded correctly and without complaints by PV 3.10.0-RC1, so continuing to use the RC version is an obvious work-around (albeit an unsatisfactory one).
The ability to load and process XDMF files is absolutely essential to my application; without it, PV is useless to me. It would thus be great to see this vital issue resolved in the near future.
I'll gladly submit a formal bug report if that should be of any help.

Jens.

When is 3.10 slated for release?
I have a patch from Takuya OSHIMA for handling a compact face format in OpenFOAM. It would be very important to get this in before the next release. What tests are needed and what is the time-frame to squeezing in this type of change before the 3.10 release?

Hi Koen,

You can turn off PARAVIEW_INSTALL_THIRD_PARTY_LIBRARIES to disable the fixup
bundle dependency scanning. It looks like it is finding your compilers
runtime (/local/software/rh53/gcc/4.3.3/lib64/libstdc++.so.6') and trying to
resolve it and it's dependencies because it isn't in a standard (/usr/lib)
location.

It was released two days ago ;-). Your patch most certainly could be
included for the next release. If you want, submit a bug on
paraview.org/Bugwith your patch, and possibly a dataset and
instructions to recreate the
original issue.

Thanks!

Hi,

I have installed paraview 3.10 on the cluster and enabled the Visitbridge. Not all dependencies for the different Visit readers are available so only a number of them is build. Running the paraview gui on the cluster works but connecting to pvserver from my windows desktop (running the binary downloaded from the website) causes a crash. I think it is because not all Visit readers are available to pvserver on the cluster. I guess I can disable the Visit readers on my desktop as a work around but this is not an ideal solution.

With 3.8.1 I get a different error:

I got them both working. I noticed an warning that SELinux was complaining
about loading a library which requires text relocation.

I changed SELinux mode from Enforcing to Permissive and then 3.10 and 3.8
both loaded correctly.

I see the git repository has a row_strech flag - please can you update to
set as true for selection too? (I have some array list properties that I
would like to fill the object inspector).

Need to add the additional line:

row_strech = true;

on line 1073 for current master.

Thanks,
Paul

Hi,

For ParaView to work you most make sure that the client and server have the
same readers enabled in the VisItBridge. In your case you will you need to
recompile the server with SILO and CGNS support if you want to load those
file formats, or recompile the client with those readers disabled.

Hi Guys,

to give you some heads up, the issue that you are facing where the
client is not working with a server which has a different proxy
definition set, such as the SILO and CGNS readers will be solved in
ParaView 4.

Now the client will get the Proxy definition from the server, so no
more mismatch in client/server capability.

Seb

PS: I don't have any time frame for it, but that code will be
available in the coming weeks to the community...
PS2: An announcement will be made to give more information about that
version anyway...

That's the case, unfortunately for now. In future i.e. with ParaView
4.0, we already have changes in queue that will ensure that the client
communicates with the server to ensure that only those readers (and
other proxies) available on the server are shown to the user.

Subject: [Paraview] Update Extents
Message-ID: <BFC6F607797EE4439A63CAC7BC43A1D101F9C5@EXCHMBX01.fed.cclrc.ac.uk>

I have a filter derived from vtkStructuredGrid. My filter generates a new dataset which may have extents larger than those set up by the source. For example, if my original extents are (0, 50, 0, 50, 0, 50) the filter may generate a new data set with extents of (0, 100, 0, 50, 50). I cannot find a way of updating the extents in my filter in such a way that ParaView fully renders my larger dataset. There must be a way to handle this in ParaView, but I've been unable to figure it out.

The problem has been reported before http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2009-March/011334.html. The suggested fix hasn't worked for me.

Can anyone suggest anything, or perhaps point me towards a filter that carries out this kind of operation?

Thanks in advance.

Owen.

61.504870583900271 -77.191571848696427

I did try the script:

import os
import string

def insertNextCell():
  nextpoly = vtk.vtkPolyLine()
  nextpoly.GetPointIds().DeepCopy(segments)
  cells.InsertNextCell(nextpoly)

filename = os.path.normcase("C:\temp\rifts_gmt.txt")
f = open(filename)

pdo = self.GetPolyDataOutput()

pts = vtk.vtkPoints()

#an array for the fault information
segmentNames = vtk.vtkStringArray()
segmentNames.SetName("Fault Information")
segmentNames.SetNumberOfComponents(1)

cells = vtk.vtkCellArray()
segments = vtk.vtkIdList()

#traverse file
for line in f:
  if line.startswith(">"):
    #when you find a new fault
    #save the one you just finished
    if segments.GetNumberOfIds() != 0:
      insertNextCell()
      segments = vtk.vtkIdList()
    segmentNames.InsertNextValue(line)
  else:
    #otherwise just keep remembering coordinates
    x,y = [float(n) for n in line.strip().split()[:2]]
    id = pts.InsertNextPoint(x,y,0)
    segments.InsertNextId(id)
f.close()

if segments.GetNumberOfIds()>0:
  #don't forget the last fault in progress
  insertNextCell()

pdo.SetPoints(pts)
pdo.SetLines(cells)
pdo.GetCellData().AddArray(segmentNames)
- this runs as a programmable source but only gives an error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 24, in <module>
  File "<string>", line 11, in RequestData
IOError: [Errno 22] invalid mode ('r') or filename: 'c:\temp\rifts_gmt.txt'. 

I am working on Windows 7.
Any ideas?
Cheers
Lester

Subject: [Paraview] python calculator: compute max value into a variable
Message-ID: <4D7A520C.80608@wmich.edu>

Hi,

I'm a newish user struggling with python and paraview... specifically,
I'd like to plot normalized scalar results and the print the
normalization factor as the title of the scalar bar.

I've found as a method of normalization from which a contour can be
plotted.

PyCalc1 = PythonCalculator()
PyCalc1.Expression = 'scalardata/max(scalardata)'
PyCalc1.ArrayName = 'normalized_scalar'

However, I'm stuck on how to capture the actual value of the max into a
variable for use as a label.

Somthing like:
maxval = max('scalardata')

where maxval now can be used for other purposes (ie further
normalization and labeling).  I'm new to python... therefore none of the
syntax and structure has become is intuitive.

Thanks,

You may want to look at the VTK/Graphics/vtkExtractGrid class.  That filter
is used to reduce the extents of a structured data set so it will have the
logic you're looking for to expand the extents of a data set.

is it because you are using "\" in your path ?
It seems that your command to open the file is wrong..

I recommend always using Unix style paths when trying to open files even
when on windows.

Hello

I have tried replacing the windows path structure with Unix style with no effect so I am not sure what the issue is ?

I can upload the whole sample file to test if that would help?

As I can tell the the script will search for the delimiter of ">" to find each segment which is clear from the input file, but for whatever reason it seems not to be able to even locate the file.

Cheers

Lester

It seems that your command to open the file is wrong..

You can build it manually and tell ParaView where it is by

VISIT_BUILD_READER_CGNS:BOOL=ON
CGNS_INCLUDE_DIR
CGNS_LIBRARY

The same for Silo which is another new VisIt reader.

VISIT_BUILD_SILO:BOOL=ON
SILO_INCLUDE_DIR
SILO_LIBRARY

I'm starting to look at building 3.10.0 for Fedora and am trying to see how 
this works.  Looks like CGNS is only handled as a bundled external project? 
Could paraview be modified to be able to use a system installed cgns library?

Running into the following trying to build ParaView 3.10.0 Fedora package on

I don't quite follow since pqComponents seems to be requested, but it isn't

This is with cmake 2.8.4 and qt 4.7.2.

Humm strange. I haven't seen this on the dashboards at all, and most of them
have examples enabled. What gcc version are you using out of curiosity?

Mark,

I am just wondering what this patch is good for? Thanks.

Also fails on F15 and F14, where RC1 compiled fine.  Also have enabled 
XDMF_WRAP_PYTHON.  Will try with that off.  gcc is 4.51 (F14) or 4.6.0 
(F15/rawhide).

Removing XDMF_WRAP_PYTHON had no effect, so this seems to be something 
introduced between RC1 and final.

Hello,

  I have rather a large output (xdmf format) of an unsteady CFD  
simulation. I need to compute some other quantities in the  
computational domain which are a function of the variables stored in  
the original dataset. I created a pipeline, which works fine but is a  
bit slow to execute every time I want to obtain a plot for a new time  
step.
  Is it possible to select only certain quantities from my pipeline  
and save them for all time steps (along with the mesh itself) in a new  
hdf/xdmf file? Thank you.

  Best regards,

  Martin Vymazal

Alright, installed Fedora 14 and tracked down the issue.

This commit fixes it for me.

find it strange that only Fedora tool chain catches this issue. ;-)

Hi Bastian,

> I am just wondering what this patch is good for?

It handles the case where 'faces' are written in a form similar to that used by CompactListList, which can be more efficient in some cases.

Ok. In this case I need to distinguish between "Where a thread live" and
"Where a thread is being executed".

But finally I have to say, that the implementation of my plugin is running
without any crashes. This was the main goal.

Thanks again, Utkarash, for your advises. It helps a lot.

Bye.

I replied prematurely without realizing the currentThreadId() is a
static method. So have you changed the "connect" to use a queued
connection or not?

Martin,

You should also be able to choose only the quantities you want to load
from the reader panel itself. Doesn't that help with performance. If
not, I don't think saving out new file with fewer quantities would
make much different either.

Hi Utkarsh,

  let's say that my data set contains quantities a0,a1,a2,a3. I need to compute
quantity bn by creating a (long) pipeline with a series of  
intermediate steps, where:

b1 = function(a0,a1,a2,a3)
b2 = function(b1,...)
b3 = function(b2,b1,...)
    ...

bn = function(b_n-1,...)

Reading only those quantities (bn) that I wish to plot is exactly what  
I would like to do. Unfortunately, they're not contained in the  
original file and I need to create this extra data set first. The  
question is: can paraview generate such an output file which stores  
these quantities? I prefer to wait at the beginning and let paraview  
write a new dataset instead of waiting every time I click and the  
pipeline is re-executed.

  Best regards,

    Martin

Ah ok. Unfortunately, writers don't allow you to choose the quantities
to write. So an option would be write the full data out with the
derived quantities and then read back only the derived quantity you
are interested in.

Subject: [Paraview] Extract geographic coordinates from spherical data
Message-ID: <SNT108-W288F75B1BD62ABB1195B4D8ACC0@phx.gbl>


Hello

I have a query and I am not sure of the best approach to resolve it.

I have a data set in spherical global coordinates generated from a geographic input matrix using the calculator function as below:

(coordsZ*cos(coordsX*3.14159265/180)*cos(coordsY*3.14159265/180))*iHat+(coordsZ*sin(coordsX*3.14159265/180)*cos(coordsY*3.14159265/180))*jHat+(coordsZ*sin(coordsY*3.14159265/180))*kHat

Wher X=Longitude, Y=Latitude and Z= Earth radius at different depths.

One point I noticed with this sphere grid is that is defined as an unstructured grid but I am unclear why? The longitudes range from 0-360 and perhaps it expects things in -180/180 format? I generated another sphere grid using the formula above and when it is sliced the spreadsheet shows the lat long values as well as the sphere coordinates: this grid has the normal geographic range on longitudes (-180/180) and is a structured curvilinear grid.

If I slice the unstructured grid all I get are the sphere coordinates and the values. How can I readily convert these back to geographic?

Thanks

Lester

On the first question, my (admittedly myopic) experience is that ParaView
is mostly only happy doing arbitrary coordinate transforms on unstructured
data -- which really makes sense, since you could move the coordinates
into positions that don't map onto any regular grid.

The three main trig functions (sin, cos, and tan) are periodic, such that
the [-180, 0] range is equivalent to the [180, 360] range. The only real
difference for a [-180, 180] longitude range is that everything is shifted
by a half-period, but as long as your data account for that, it doesn't
matter.

> If I slice the unstructured grid all I get are the sphere coordinates and

I think terminology is getting confused, which happens to me often enough,
so I'll try and make things more explicit. Spherical coordinates are
coordinates of (theta, phi, radius), or in your case, something like
(longitude, latitude, radius). Cartesian coordinates are in (x, y, z),
which is how we usually think about the world. If you have the Earth
looking like the Earth (i.e., a rendering of your data looks like a
sphere), you're in Cartesian coordinates. On the other hand, if you have a
flat Earth, so that the x-axis is values of longitude on a range of e.g.
[-180, 180], you're in spherical coordinates.

So I assume your question is that you're in Cartesian coordinates (Earth
looks like the Earth) and you want to get back to spherical (flat Earth).
I haven't dealt with this myself, but the Wiki says the transformation is:

radius = sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2)
longitude = acos(z / radius)
latitude = atan(y / x)

Note that this will probably put latitude on a [0, 180] range (since
that's how math people, being disconnected from any real application of
spherical coordinates, define them), so you'll probably want to subtract
90 from the resulting latitude to make sure that 0 degrees latitude is the
equator.

Hi all,

I have build the 3.10 source from paraview.org without any plroblems.
However, I can run paraview only from the build directory. After a
successuful "make install" I get:

 /opt/paraview/3.10.0/lib/paraview-3.10/paraview: symbol lookup error: /opt/paraview/3.10.0/lib/paraview-3.10/libQtXmlPatterns.so.4: undefined symbol: _ZNK21QNetworkAccessManager10metaObjectEv



I use QT 4.6.2 which is not my system QT. All paths in ccmake 2.8.3
point to this QT. Ideas?

Thanks Bastian

Try turning off PARAVIEW_INSTALL_THIRD_PARTY_LIBRARIES. ( I think I am going
to make it default OFF instead of ON). Then blow away your install tree and
do a fresh make install. Does that resolve the problem?

Thanks David,

I forgot to mention - I already tried this. It does not help at all.
Instead of this I get three missing *.so-Libraries (all from QT). After
symmlinking them from the qt-lib to the paraview-lib I still get the
same error.

That seems to have done the trick.  Thanks.  Still planning on a 3.10.1 soon?

For those interested, I will give here my script how to extract the minimum
value and its location in a serie of time steps, write it to file and put
spheres on the local minimum.

Since my knowledge of VTK is quite limited, I didn't know how to access the
data, so I use some tricking to get it. Probably a much cleaner way of doing
this is possible. Be free to give suggestions

In order to get the locations from the ProgrammableFilter, my trick is to
write all the data with CSVWriter to separate files, and then loop over the
time step and read each file which containt the vtkTable data. This can
porbably as well obtained directory from the ProgrammableFilter, but how ?

Also, I wonder if it is necessary to use the ProgramableFilter in the first
place, because I am using pvbatch. So I am calling a python script from a
python script. The reason was that this allow to create a vtkTable, but
again, this can be done better I guess.

Anyway, any comments are welcome. I am also still learning this batch
programming in paraview. anyway, the version below works and I am quite
satisfied about the result

Message-ID: <BFC6F607797EE4439A63CAC7BC43A1D10225A9@EXCHMBX01.fed.cclrc.ac.uk>

Hi,

I've been able to build Paraview on my x64 windows 7 machine using cmake/vs2010. I recently tried to build the python components of paraview on the same platform. I can create and generate the solution okay, but the build fails with:

fatal error C1083: Cannot open source file: 'vtkAbstractArrayPython.cxx': No such file or directory

I have x64 python 2.5.4 and have checked the cmake configuration carefully. Has anyone else experienced this problem?

Subject: [Paraview] Applying filters in sample app
Message-ID: <C9A5096C.860D%reuterma@ornl.gov>

Hi,

I'm working on a sample application and I've been trying to make a cut appear on the data that is being viewed. I've followed the methodology used in the QuickContour application in my application, but the cut never appears on the data view. I'm using the data file associated with the QuickContour application to test my application. I'm guessing I'm just not understanding the required setup logic for behaviors and reactions in order to get the cut to apply. If anyone can see where I'm being dumb, my code is located here: https://github.com/mareuter/PVMockupGui. The cut is being applied in the mpMainWindow class in mpMainWindow::onCutButtonClicked. I am currently compiling against the ParaView git master on Ubuntu.

Thanks,
M

Hello, Dave.

The CGNS reader works fine on PV 3.10.0 Linux 64 bit since you have 
re-packaged the binaries, but I can't get it working on PV 3.10.0  
Windows 32 bit.

I have re-dowloaded the Windows 32 bit binaries and I tried several 
examples from the CGNS data base (delta.cgns, delta_vertex.cgns and 
multi.cgns): PV always crashes when I select a cgns file. Otherwise, PV 
3.10.0 is working fine with my Tecplot files.

Could you take a look at this CGNS Windows problem?

Best regards.

Hi Richard, we fixed the issue with the 32bit Windows binary. It is actually
a pretty serious bug in the VisIt code because it attempts to delete memory
allocated in one library in another. Amazingly it only crashed on 32bit
Windows.

@@ -1073,7 +1073,7 @@

We are going to release a 3.10.1 that includes the fix as soon as we get
feedback on several other fixes that we also will be including.

Thank you for your patience.

Amazing ! Is this the curse of Windows ? :-D
Indeed, it's not very annoying for me as I justed wanted to test the 
CGNS reader on both OS. In fact, I will have to work with cgns files 
only on my Linux workstation. On my Windows laptop, I am always using 
Tecplot files.

OK, I will have a look on the download page for the next release.

Thank you very much for this info.

Richard.

David,

our system administrator did the build. AFAIK it was build from source.

Message-ID: <7F7CB2A87C76454FA8409EA326FC029728E70BD3@exch-mbx2.ad.renci.org>

Hi,

I would like to use .pvtu to represent a multi-level unstructured grid by stating

===level 1 PVTU===
<VTKFile type="PUnstructuredGrid" version="0.1" byte_order="LittleEndian">
  <PUnstructuredGrid GhostLevel="1">
...
    <Piece Source="energy_1.0/nsp.pvtu"/>
    <Piece Source="energy_2.0/nsp.pvtu"/>
  </PUnstructuredGrid>
</VTKFile>


===level 0 PVTU (energy_1.0/nsp.pvtu)===
<VTKFile type="PUnstructuredGrid" version="0.1" byte_order="LittleEndian">
  <PUnstructuredGrid GhostLevel="0">
...
    <Piece Source="nsp_316.vtu"/>
...
    <Piece Source="nsp_523.vtu"/>
  </PUnstructuredGrid>
</VTKFile>

After constructing these PVTU's and VTU's, I opened the level 1 PVTU and got below errors: ERROR: In ..\..\..\ParaViewSrc\VTK\IO\vtkXMLPDataReader.cxx, line 364 vtkXMLPUnstructuredGridReader (00000000055D5860): File for piece 0 cannot be read. Note loading level 0 PVTU's and individual VTU's are of no error in ParaView. Did I miss anything? I could not find an example showing multi-level parallel VTK data construction. Would you please help? Thanks a lot.

Best,
8gpus

You're simply missing a line to hide the previous representation. I
just added in mpMainWindow::onCutButtonClicked before the render()
call and the slice shows up.

   this->ActiveSourceRepr->setVisible(false);

I've followed the methodology used in the QuickContour application in my application, but the cut never appears on the data view. I'm using the data file associated with the QuickContour application to test my application. I'm guessing I'm just not understanding the required setup logic for behaviors and reactions in order to get the cut to apply. If anyone can see where I'm being dumb, my code is located here: https://github.com/mareuter/PVMockupGui. The cut is being applied in the mpMainWindow class in mpMainWindow::onCutButtonClicked. I am currently compiling against the ParaView git master on Ubuntu.

We are asking because the 4.6.X prebuilt frameworks from Nokia don't come
with QNetworkAccessManager. I would confirm with your
system administrator that Qt has been built with QtNetwork enabled.

I just wanted to share a bit of useful code.  I wanted to confirm that all
my pvserver processes had the correct DISPLAY environment variable defined.
I created an mpi command line that launched two processes per node, with
half the processes using -display :0.0 and the other half using -display
:0.1.  After connecting to the server, I ran this python code inside a
Programmable Source:


import os
import subprocess

display = os.getenv('DISPLAY')
hostname = subprocess.Popen(['hostname'],
stdout=subprocess.PIPE).communicate()[0].strip()
print hostname, display




The output is printed to the pvserver terminal:

Process id: 3 >> vs8 :0.0
Process id: 4 >> vs14 :0.1
Process id: 7 >> vs8 :0.1
Process id: 0 >> vs14 :0.0
Process id: 5 >> vs30 :0.1

Subject: [Paraview] Camera problem
Message-ID: <201103160830.p2G8UQJP012075@relay-auth.mailprotect.be>

Hi,

I am trying to make a simple animation in paraview, let's say just turn around my
geometry.
So, in the "Animation view" panel, I add a "camera", and select "follow path",
which is by default a circle around my geometry.
Now, if I play this animation, it will turn around the geometry, but it is very
zoomed in, so I can't see the whole geometry as it is turning around!
Then, if I try to define the path as a circle with a much larger radius, the
animation stay the same.

Also, if I use "interpolate camera locations" instead of "follow path" in the
animation view panel, it does the same : it goes from one view to the other, BUT
zommed in, even if I define unzoomed views for the different camera locations.
The orientation, angle, etc. are correct, but always zoomed in.

How can I do ?


Regards,

Arnaud.

Message-ID: <SNT108-W30BCF31960A68407EC9A068ACE0@phx.gbl>


Hello

Is there an easy way to get Shapefile data from ArcGIS into Paraview? It is an important file format and one which is widely used so it would be great if there was a method of importing this. As I see it, one has to somehow convert the format to a VTK structure (vector-based), not sure of the easiest solution.

Any suggestions?

Thanks

As Mark says it would be very important, so we really hope to see this
included in the upcoming 3.10.1 release.

Thanks!

I think this is a runtime issue executing qhelpgenerator. If you put the
location of libQtHelp.so in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH does it work? So likely if
you do the following:

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=
/usr/global/paraview/Trolltech/Qt-4.6.0/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

and then make

I had the same problem.  I fixed it by setting the QT_HELP_GENERATOR cmake
value and that fixed it.

Subject: [Paraview] how to build a parallel server for paraview?
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=tJOMin-Z7cB+f=Cq1hPOonqo7yjytDAGnrEUQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I recently met a problem when I try to use the server/client mode.

In my lab, several PCs are connected using Ethernet.
Windows is running on each of them.
I want to use them as post-processing server.

I run
  "mpiexec -np -hosts host1 host2 .... pvserver.exe"
Each host is a PC machine.

But I found I can connect to only one PC.
When I connect to it, I can only see its local disk.
How can I make use of all these PCs?
How to build a parallel server for paraview?

Thanks very much.
,
roos.

Hi Daniel,

I just copied those files as is from the wiki and ran the example with both
python scripts and didn't have any problems.  I'm going to need some more
information before diagnosing this.  What version of ParaView are you
using?  Any other info which you think may be pertinent?

Hi Daniel,

Please respond to the list as well to allow other people to benefit from
this discussion.

I just found out what is going on.  This has been fixed in the master
branch.  For the release branch, it isn't affecting the output for these
examples and is just a print statement that accidentally made it through.

Dear Andy,

I can see the output files - however, in which way will I see the 
results in the ParaView application?

If you run the paraview gui, you should be able to just open these files
directly there.  A new paraview user's guide is available at
http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Users_Guide/Table_Of_Contents which may
help you.

Hi Utkarsh,

 Thanks, that did the trick. I'm also trying to get an ImplicitPlaneWidget

It is possible to open them - but how is it possible to see the 
visualization results being displayed live in the application, on creation?

You have /opt/paraview/3.10.0/lib/paraview-3.10/libQtXmlPatterns.so.4 in

Pat Marion did some work on that but it hasn't made it into the main
paraview repo yet.  You can see a video at http://patmarion.com/pv/live
-vis.mp4 or http://patmarion.com/pv/live-vis.ogv.  It will eventually make
it into ParaView but I don't know what the timeline for that is.

Ok - so there is currently no way to create this kind of live 
visualization in ParaView.

I hope that the library makes it into the release version soon - it 
looks fantastic, thanks for the links.


Best,
Daniel

Subject: [Paraview] paraview transformation filter
Message-ID: <4D81161B.80405@doc.ic.ac.uk>

Hi,

I'm new to paraview. I'm trying to display two surfaces in 3D view in 
paraview GUI. Two surfaces (.vtk file) are intersected with each other 
and can be displayed correctly using vtk-python script. I put the 
orientation, translation, scale, which are extracted from the 4x4 
transformation matrix, in the 'transformation' window under 'display' in 
'object inspector', and set the origin in the header of the vtk files of 
the two surfaces to '0, 0, 0'. But no luck.

So do I need to construct a pipeline instead? or, paraview calculates 
the orientation and translation from the matrix in a different way 
comparing to vtk (I used the same matrix in vtk.DeepCopy)?

Regards
Helen

I pulled again from master today and built and it works fine now. Very

Subject: [Paraview] can not drag object in TestPVSynchronizedRenderWindows
Message-ID: <BAY148-w32EA6D1479D079FFACBFCFC3B10@phx.gbl>


Hello, I'm new paraview code user and I tried some stuff in "TestPVSynchronizedRenderWindows" but when run , I can only rotate and zoom, but I would like to move object with the 3 mouse button. ( like when I use vtkRenderWindow with vtkRenderWindowInteractor ).

In TestPVSynchronizedRenderWindows we use Proxy and I didn't find how to add the drag on it.

My proxy are :

vtkSMProxy* repr = pxm->NewProxy("representations","GeometryRepresentation");
vtkSMProxy* viewProxy = vtkSMProxyManager::GetProxyManager()->NewProxy("views", "RenderView");

Thanks

Perfect! Thanks David and Takuya.
Sorry I still didn't have time to compile and test it myself.

Hey Takuya and Mark,

Do either of you have a dataset that could be included in ParaViewData to
make a simple regression test that exercises this functionality?

Thanks!

Is there currently any particular OpenFOAM dataset being used for testing? If so, I could convert it into the compact-face format.

Otherwise the dataset from Takuya (cavity tutorial I think) should be okay - there are no license issues.

Yes the cavity tutorial. AFAIK there's no OpenFOAM dataset being used
for testing ( http://paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=10247 ), so I
attached Mark's cavity dataset (with addition of a .foam stub). Dave,
open cavity.foam in the archive and Apply.

I wouldn't recommend using TestPVSynchronizedRenderWindows as the
basis for any code. It was an executable built specifically to test
some functionality being developed at that time and will be removed in
future. Look at BasicApp.cxx instead.

Subject: [Paraview] loading nc formatted data
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=S4XnLjK4FcmAXNRdQsGhWzx1ov5ynURYiRCHs@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

ftp://ftp.gfdl.noaa.gov/pub/sms/4ParaView/1.png
ftp://ftp.gfdl.noaa.gov/pub/sms/4ParaView/2.png
ftp://ftp.gfdl.noaa.gov/pub/sms/4ParaView/3.png

the above are screen shot from older version of *.nc files that I have that
I loaded up with Paraview 3.10.0 64-bit which I compiled myself. As you can
see, the grid is correctly loaded. But in the data, there is a crack. Is
there a filter that can fix this in ParaView? :)

ftp://ftp.gfdl.noaa.gov/pub/sms/4ParaView/4.png is the latest nc file that I
have of similar simulation preprocessed output. When I loaded it up, it is
clearly doing making assumption on the grid that is not correct and hence,
the double looking grid.

The questions now are:

1. ParaView has lots of *.nc file loader. How do I know which loader is
ParaView using to load the data? If I pick a type for the Files of type
option in the open File window, will that gurantees that ParaView will be
using that particular file loader?

2. If I know which loader is used, I would like to see if I can modify the
existing loader to create a new type of *.nc file loader to fix the grid of
my data. Where is the code in the source tree of ParaView is the loader
plugin placed?

or if there is an easier solution to fix my grid problem that doesn't
involve developing a new data loader plugin that would be better.... :)
please let me know...

thanks

Message-ID: <SNT123-W2F1F3D3B1EC7844E42A05BCB10@phx.gbl>


Dear all, 

I'm encountering problems compiling the latest ParaView version. 

I've checked out the source code via git as described on your "build and install" page in the wiki. 

I've configured ParaView and set the PARAVIEW_USE_MPI option to ON. 

Compiling ParaView, I get the error

 Generating moc_TestingDemo.cxx
/usr/bin/qhelpgenerator: symbol lookup error: /usr/lib64/qt4/libQtHelp.so.4: undefined symbol: _ZN9QListData7detach3Ev
[  8%] make[2]: *** [Documentation/paraview.qch] Error 127
make[1]: *** [Documentation/CMakeFiles/ParaViewOnlineHelp.dir/all] Error 2
make[1]: *** Waiting for unfinished jobs....

I'm using Qt version 4.6.2 as recommended. 

My operating system is Gentoo Linux version 4.4.3-r2.

Thanks for helping me,
Natalie

David,

QtNetwork is not there, but it is there in my 3.8.1 installation....
After linking it I still get the same undefined smbol error.

Regards Bastian

You have /opt/paraview/3.10.0/lib/paraview-3.10/libQtXmlPatterns.so.4 in
your install tree. Is QtNetwork.so also in that directory?

Subject: [Paraview] how to build a parallel server for paraview?
In-Reply-To: <AANLkTi=tJOMin-Z7cB+f=Cq1hPOonqo7yjytDAGnrEUQ@mail.gmail.com>

Setting up a cluster is somewhat outside the scope of the paraview list.

However, the parallel chapter in the new paraview book begins with
references that should help you.
See: http://paraview.org/Wiki/Users_Guide_Client-Server_Visualization

There are two system admin tasks that you want to tackle.
1) Set up a shared filesystem such as SMB, nfs, pvfs etc.
2) Configure the MPI installation on each machine to know about and be
authorized to connect to and run code on the rest of the machines. For both
tasks you need to consult the documentation that comes with the related
system software or let google do it.

Instead of testing the installation by running pvserver, I recommend you
start with a hello world program and once that is working try pvserver.

Since this is a windows cluster you may want to try Microsoft Windows HPC
server. It has fairly nice job scheduling (pbs like) features beyond what
something like stock MPICH offers and has decent support for making use of
hardware accelerated rendering. A demo of using ParaView on such a cluster
is given in:

Subject: [Paraview] Access to the renderer
Message-ID: <5861C625258167499D051F0CE1D0FE4B03EA6A43@GLKMS2104.GREENLNK.NET>

Hi all,
 
I'm looking for a way to get use vtkSelectVisiblePoints within a C++
filter in ParaView.
 
Outside of ParaView, we have generated working VTK code that creates a
renderer and renderwindow, sets up a camera, adds mappers and actors and
passess the renderer onto selectvisiblepoints.  We'd like to do all this
within ParaView so should be able to pass the ParaView renderer to
MySelectVisiblePoints->SetRenderer(xxxxx).
 
Can anyone suggest a solution?  
 
Many thanks,
 
Duncan Johnson

The short answer is you cannot do it. In ParaView logically filters
are on data-server and renderers are on render-server. The
abstractions provided by ParaView hide these components so that such
things are very difficult to do.

For the longer answer, it'd help if you can describe why you want to
call "select visible points" in your filter?

I'm not aware of any filter that will fix this automatically.   Can you
describe the grid a bit more?  It kind of looks like a multiblock of
structured grids.

If there is an ambiguity for which file loader to use (i.e. multiple readers
assume the same extension), then the GUI should pop up a dialog for you to
specify which one to use.  You can use the python trace to figure out
exactly what reader is being used to load the file.

Based on the name of the name of the reader from the python script, you can
look up the actual class name in the
ParaView/Servers/ServerManager/Resources/readers.xml file.

Call the following after the view is created.

void setupCameraManipulators(vtkSMProxy* view)
{
  vtkSMProxyManager* pxm = vtkSMProxyManager::GetProxyManager();
  vtkIdType cid = view->GetConnectionID();
  vtkSMProxy* manip = pxm->NewProxy("cameramanipulators",
    "TrackballRotate");
  vtkSMPropertyHelper(manip, "Button").Set(1);
  vtkSMPropertyHelper(manip, "ManipulatorName").Set("Rotate");
  manip->UpdateVTKObjects();
  vtkSMPropertyHelper(view, "CameraManipulators").Add(manip);
  manip->Delete();

  manip = pxm->NewProxy("cameramanipulators",
    "TrackballZoom");
  vtkSMPropertyHelper(manip, "Button").Set(3);
  vtkSMPropertyHelper(manip, "ManipulatorName").Set("Zoom");
  manip->UpdateVTKObjects();

Michael,

The interactive-widgets such as implicit plane widget are created by
the "Properties" panel to help user change some of the properties for
the filter. So yes, if your example, you will not see the implicit
plane widget at all. You'll have to manually create it and set it up
to update the properties of the "clip" filter as the user moves it. It
can be a bit tricky. But maybe I can hack up some code in your example
to show the implicit plane if you'd like.

Hello David,

Somewhat related to the above topic, this issue would also be important for the 3.10.1 update.

Message-ID: <BAY148-w115DD917E0DAF99DAAF38FC3B00@phx.gbl>


Hello, I have the following errors when compiling paraview and I don't have any ID of what it is ...

:: error: ../../../bin/libvtkStreaming.a(vtkACosmoReader.cxx.o): relocation R_X86_64_32 against `.rodata' can not be used when making a shared object; recompile with -fPIC

../../../bin/libvtkStreaming.a:: error: could not read symbols: Bad value


I did look on google, but nobody have this problem for the same library than me, an nearly all the solution I saw where deprecated ...

thanks for your help ^^.

My guess is that some library rodata is getting built without the "-fPIC"
flag.  If you built that yourself then you should rebuild that with that
compile flag.  If not, try adding -fPIC to your CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS and
CMAKE_C_FLAGS during configuration.

Sorry Paul. I tried various things
--builtin/client-server/client-server parallel and I still can't
reproduce the issue. Have you been able to reproduce the problem on
any other machine? Any other information that you can give about your
setup that you think may help. Try running paraview with "-dr"command
line option. Does that make any difference?

Hi Andy,

python trace gave me

  zos_Omon_GFDLESM2M_historical_r1i1p1_186101188012_nc = NetCDFReader(
FileName=['/work/sms/data/cmor-20110128/mon/ocean/zos/r1i1p1/zos_Omon_GFDL-ESM2M_historical_r1i1p1_186101-188012.nc']
)

and there are tons of netcdf reader in ParaView and it is not in the plugin
directory

Can you help describe how Netcdf files plugins are done in ParaView. Do they
have a super class of Netcdf that they all derive from to write the
different flavors of netcdf readers? If so, where can the code be found?

thanks

David,

QtNetwork is not there, but it is there in my 3.8.1 installation....
After linking it I still get the same undefined smbol error.

Hi,

I'd like to build a 3.10.0 pvserver that is compatible with KW's 
binaries. Which options should be enabled/disabled?

Thanks
Burlen

The reader that is being used is vtkNetCDFCFReader.  It is defined in ParaView/Servers/ServerManager/Resources/readers.xml, although it is not obvious.

As the name implies, this reader reads netCDF files using the CF convention.  (As the default netCDF reader, it also gracefully handles files that do not follow this convention.) With this assumption, I will try to explain what it does.  It reads arrays as regular 1, 2, or 3D arrays, possibly with time.  The CF convention also provides a means to assign coordinates to each grid point and to identify the coordinates as longitude or latitude.

Even though coordinates are defined as longitude and latitude, the topology of the grid itself is still a grid.  Thus, the grid gets wrapped around, but still has these seems that you see because topologically the one end of the regular grid is not attached to the other.  I can't think of any filter that will identify and close these seems.  In fact, it's not straightforward to do at all.  If you look at your topology, it is not lain out on a simple spherical grid.

The "right" way to solve your problem, which may or may not be in your control, is to create netCDF files that specify cell boundaries for a closed topology.  Your netCDF file must be following at least some parts of the CF convention; your data would not show up as a sphere if it were not.  The CF convention provides a way of defining cells that are not constrained by a regular grid topology.  It is done through a "bounds" attribute on the dimension descriptor variables.  You need either 1D or 2D bounds.  They are described in this section of the CF convention documentation: http://cf-pcmdi.llnl.gov/documents/cf-conventions/1.5/cf-conventions.html#cell-boundaries.

The VTK test data has examples of both 1D bounds (tos_O1_2001-2002.nc) and 2D bounds (sampleCurveGrid4.nc).  You can get the VTK test data from git (http://vtk.org/VTKData.git), or download them directly from the gitourious server:

Can you help describe how Netcdf files plugins are done in ParaView. Do they have a super class of Netcdf that they all derive from to write the different flavors of netcdf readers? If so, where can the code be found?

the above are screen shot from older version of *.nc files that I have that I loaded up with Paraview 3.10.0 64-bit which I compiled myself. As you can see, the grid is correctly loaded. But in the data, there is a crack. Is there a filter that can fix this in ParaView? :)

I'm not aware of any filter that will fix this automatically.   Can you describe the grid a bit more?  It kind of looks like a multiblock of structured grids.

ftp://ftp.gfdl.noaa.gov/pub/sms/4ParaView/4.png is the latest nc file that I have of similar simulation preprocessed output. When I loaded it up, it is clearly doing making assumption on the grid that is not correct and hence, the double looking grid.

The questions now are:

1. ParaView has lots of *.nc file loader. How do I know which loader is ParaView using to load the data? If I pick a type for the Files of type option in the open File window, will that gurantees that ParaView will be using that particular file loader?

If there is an ambiguity for which file loader to use (i.e. multiple readers assume the same extension), then the GUI should pop up a dialog for you to specify which one to use.  You can use the python trace to figure out exactly what reader is being used to load the file.


2. If I know which loader is used, I would like to see if I can modify the existing loader to create a new type of *.nc file loader to fix the grid of my data. Where is the code in the source tree of ParaView is the loader plugin placed?
Based on the name of the name of the reader from the python script, you can look up the actual class name in the ParaView/Servers/ServerManager/Resources/readers.xml file.


or if there is an easier solution to fix my grid problem that doesn't involve developing a new data loader plugin that would be better.... :)  please let me know...

dp = GetDisplayProperties(reader)

dp.Representation='Surface'

Still pass in the "reader" to AnimateReader() call. You are not
"modifying the data", merely how it's rendered.

Message-ID: <7779F00A-F8DA-49E4-939D-53A6F4FB2991@monash.edu>

Hi all,  
I was happy to see that tecplot binary files are now supported in  Paraview 3.10.0. However, when I try to use the reader I receive the error shown below. However, the file is a valid tecplot binary file (it loads in tec360 2010).

I am guessing there may be a limitation in the versions of tecplot files that are valid for the reader. Does anyone know these limitations?

Hi  ParaView Users ;)


 I have problem with editing mesh/models.  I have a model/mesh (skelleton of
vasculature )  .vtk.
I want to join some separated parts of this model by using mouse in 3D

Is it possible in ParaView ?
What can I do it ?  Could someone give me some advice  please ?

Hi Chris.

I succeeded in reading binary tecplot files, one written by a very old 
Tecplot version and one written by Tecplot 360 2010. These files are 3D 
surface structured grids.
What kind of tecplot file are you trying to read ?

Hi Chris.

It's me again: your error message
> Unable to find any meshes 
sounds like the error message I had when trying to read CGNS files. Dave 
Partyka has discovered an error and has re-packaged the binaries, and 
now it works on Linux. However, this error still appears with the 
Windows binaries. If you are on Linux, please try to re-download the 
binaries. If your are on Windows, you should wait for PV 3.10.1 (See the 
discussion about the CGNS reader).

Just to answer my own questions. Indeed it is possible to skip
ProgrammableFilter if you are programming in pvbatch. The data can be
accessed in the following way (which was my question). Below is much more
efficient, because there  is no need for writing data to file. Well,
hopefully this information can be usefull for people writing batch programs
and are struggling with the proper set of commands to retrieve the data from
the arrays. Not much information can be found with google, but just
sufficient to give me the right clues to figure it out.

Regards.

Hi Utkarsh,

 Thanks for the response. It would be greatly appreciated if you have the
time to provide some code for setting up the implicit plane. I have
continued to try and diagnose things myself without much luck.

Message-ID: <F556EAA9-97E3-4507-9A7E-87458BE39EBA@indiana.edu>

Hello,

I'm confused with the output of the PlotOverLine filter in PV 3.10 (vs. what I used to see in 3.8).  Basically, I seem to get extra/unwanted results plotted in 3.10 and wondering why that is and how I can make it "do what I want" :)  Hopefully, the screen captures & explanation at the bottom of this page will illustrate the issue:  http://mypage.iu.edu/~heiland/neurons/matlab_paraview/
I only want a line plot of the TE values.

thanks, Randy

You can go to the Display tab to choose which variables to plot.

I'm not sure about the error message as I wasn't able to reproduce that
although I didn't really try :)

Thanks for the reply Andy.  Actually, when I click on the plot window, then click the Display tab in the Object Inspector, TE was the only variable checked (but all variables were being plotted).  However, when I check an additional variable and then un-check it, I get the desired plot - only TE.

Hi Randy,

Could you create a bug on www.paraview.org/Bug about the display tab
being incorrect?

Hi Ken,

Thank you for explaining.

  The reader that is being used is vtkNetCDFCFReader.  It is defined in

Can you (or Andy) point me to documentation more documentation beside
http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/ParaView/Plugin_HowTo ? Andy also metioned
readers.xml file you mentioned. But after going through ParaView/Servers/
ServerManager/Resources/readers.xml, I am still fuzzy about where the file
vtkNetCDFCFReader.cxx ( if any -  I would like to know how it is implemented
and maybe start by modifying it in my learning process). The plugin wiki
page on "Adding a Reader" section mentioned CMakeList.txt file

FIND_PACKAGE(ParaView REQUIRED)
INCLUDE(${PARAVIEW_USE_FILE})
 ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN(MyReader "1.0"
   SERVER_MANAGER_XML MyPNGReader.xml
   SERVER_MANAGER_SOURCES vtkMyPNGReader.cxx
   GUI_RESOURCE_FILES MyReaderGUI.xml)


but the one on my source tree
ParaView-3.10.0/Examples/Plugins/Reader/CMakeList.txt looks like

  ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN(MyPNGReader "1.0"
    SERVER_MANAGER_XML readers.xml
    GUI_RESOURCE_FILES pqReader.xml
    )

note no vtkMyPNGReader.cxx file mention and the file is also not in the
directory.  I also did a search on source tree for vtkNetCDFCFReader.cxx
file but can't find it. I think I am missing a big piece of something  since
I am not getting the point that I should be getting after looking at
readers.xml. In fact, I can't find any of the netcdf file readers (other
than CF reader). It is also not listed under my Plugin Manager GUI on the
ParaView that I compiled but it is loading the CF convention nc file. Are
they (the *.cxx files) generated on the fly during compile time?

Another thing, besides http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/VisIt_Database_Bridge ,
is there a place that I can find how to use that VisIt bridge in ParaView.
Maybe an example of how to load silo file? I actually have a plugin of my
own in VisIt that can load the climate modeling data that I have. I would
like to see if I can use my VisIt plugin in ParaView and not write another
plugin for ParaView? :)

The published nc files we have do adhere to CF convention we also use CMOR
in one of the pipeline. I noticed  Data_tos_O1_2001-2002.nc is at CF-1.0 and
since I am new at CF Convention, I can only speculate that what I see at
ftp://ftp.gfdl.noaa.gov/pub/sms/4ParaView/4.png with what looks like double
grid is due to difference between CF-1.0 and CF-1.4? Will vtkNetCDFCFReader
handle CF-1.4 data?

Agreed. The hack we have in VisIt loader (replace the last grid value with
the 1st grid value to create a "closed topology" ) is not "generalizable"
and will blow up in my face if I hand it to the user.

Hi Brian,

on the proxy itself, you can call either of the two methods
UpdatePropertyInformation() /
UpdatePropertyInformation(vtkSMProperty*)

Message-ID: <C9AD3271.32FB%kmorel@sandia.gov>

It looks like the documentation for a reader plugin is slightly messed up.  I'll leave it to Andy (or anyone who is not me) to fix.  The example in the ParaView source does not list a file in SERVER_MANAGER_SOURCES because it uses a source (vtkPNGReader.cxx) that is already compiled as part of VTK.  The Wiki is trying to capture the fact that usually you are building a plugin with your own reader, and you will have to list your source code for the reader there.  vtkMyPNGReader.cxx is just a stand in for some reader that you wrote.  It probably does not really exist.  I noticed, however, that the Wiki documentation is also wrong in that the XML file is pointing to the vtkPNGReader class when the CMake configuration is implying that it should be pointing to the (imaginary) vtkMyPNGReader class.

The vtkNetCDFCFReader.cxx file is located in ParaView/VTK/IO/vtkNetCDFCFReader.cxx.  Don't get too wrapped up around the complexity of the NetCDF reader definition in readers.xml.  It's complicated because it supports defining a time series as a collection of files (http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/Animating_legacy_VTK_file_series#Making_custom_readers_work_with_file_series).  If you collect all times in a single netCDF file (or don't have time steps), you can skip all that and just define a new object much like that of netCDFReaderCore in reader.xml (in the sources ProxyGroup of course).

That said, I think this should all be unnecessary since the CF convention (and ParaView reader) already contains a means of defining cells that bridge across these seems.  I suspect it has nothing to do with the CF convention version.  It is probably that your data files with openings at the seems are not defining a bounds attribute, which is optional in CF.  If you could post some example data (or even the listing of the file header from ncdump) I might be able to verify that.

I'm not sure what is going on with the new data set (4.png).  I can't comment on it much because your ftp server seems to be broken for me and I don't remember the image too well.  At any rate, I would probably say something like I couldn't tell you what was going on without seeing the nc file.

Subject: Re: [Paraview] loading nc formatted data

Hi Ken,

Thank you for explaining.

The reader that is being used is vtkNetCDFCFReader.  It is defined in ParaView/Servers/ServerManager/Resources/readers.xml, although it is not obvious.


Can you (or Andy) point me to documentation more documentation beside http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/ParaView/Plugin_HowTo ? Andy also metioned readers.xml file you mentioned. But after going through ParaView/Servers/
ServerManager/Resources/readers.xml, I am still fuzzy about where the file vtkNetCDFCFReader.cxx ( if any -  I would like to know how it is implemented and maybe start by modifying it in my learning process). The plugin wiki page on "Adding a Reader" section mentioned CMakeList.txt file


FIND_PACKAGE(ParaView REQUIRED)
INCLUDE(${PARAVIEW_USE_FILE})
 ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN(MyReader "1.0"

   SERVER_MANAGER_XML MyPNGReader.xml
   SERVER_MANAGER_SOURCES vtkMyPNGReader.cxx
   GUI_RESOURCE_FILES MyReaderGUI.xml)

but the one on my source tree ParaView-3.10.0/Examples/Plugins/Reader/CMakeList.txt looks like

  ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN(MyPNGReader "1.0"
    SERVER_MANAGER_XML readers.xml
    GUI_RESOURCE_FILES pqReader.xml
    )

note no vtkMyPNGReader.cxx file mention and the file is also not in the directory.  I also did a search on source tree for vtkNetCDFCFReader.cxx file but can't find it. I think I am missing a big piece of something  since I am not getting the point that I should be getting after looking at readers.xml. In fact, I can't find any of the netcdf file readers (other than CF reader). It is also not listed under my Plugin Manager GUI on the ParaView that I compiled but it is loading the CF convention nc file. Are they (the *.cxx files) generated on the fly during compile time?

Another thing, besides http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/VisIt_Database_Bridge , is there a place that I can find how to use that VisIt bridge in ParaView. Maybe an example of how to load silo file? I actually have a plugin of my own in VisIt that can load the climate modeling data that I have. I would like to see if I can use my VisIt plugin in ParaView and not write another plugin for ParaView? :)


As the name implies, this reader reads netCDF files using the CF convention.  (As the default netCDF reader, it also gracefully handles files that do not follow this convention.) With this assumption, I will try to explain what it does.  It reads arrays as regular 1, 2, or 3D arrays, possibly with time.  The CF convention also provides a means to assign coordinates to each grid point and to identify the coordinates as longitude or latitude.


The published nc files we have do adhere to CF convention we also use CMOR in one of the pipeline. I noticed  Data_tos_O1_2001-2002.nc is at CF-1.0 and since I am new at CF Convention, I can only speculate that what I see at ftp://ftp.gfdl.noaa.gov/pub/sms/4ParaView/4.png with what looks like double grid is due to difference between CF-1.0 and CF-1.4? Will vtkNetCDFCFReader handle CF-1.4 data?



Even though coordinates are defined as longitude and latitude, the topology of the grid itself is still a grid.  Thus, the grid gets wrapped around, but still has these seems that you see because topologically the one end of the regular grid is not attached to the other.  I can't think of any filter that will identify and close these seems.  In fact, it's not straightforward to do at all.  If you look at your topology, it is not lain out on a simple spherical grid.

The "right" way to solve your problem, which may or may not be in your control, is to create netCDF files that specify cell boundaries for a closed topology.  Your netCDF file must be following at least some parts of the CF convention; your data would not show up as a sphere if it were not.  The CF convention provides a way of defining cells that are not constrained by a regular grid topology.  It is done through a "bounds" attribute on the dimension descriptor variables.  You need either 1D or 2D bounds.  They are described in this section of the CF convention documentation: http://cf-pcmdi.llnl.gov/documents/cf-conventions/1.5/cf-conventions.html#cell-boundaries.


Agreed. The hack we have in VisIt loader (replace the last grid value with the 1st grid value to create a "closed topology" ) is not "generalizable" and will blow up in my face if I hand it to the user.


thanks
-simon




The VTK test data has examples of both 1D bounds (tos_O1_2001-2002.nc) and 2D bounds (sampleCurveGrid4.nc).  You can get the VTK test data from git (http://vtk.org/VTKData.git), or download them directly from the gitourious server:

the above are screen shot from older version of *.nc files that I have that I loaded up with Paraview 3.10.0 64-bit which I compiled myself. As you can see, the grid is correctly loaded. But in the data, there is a crack. Is there a filter that can fix this in ParaView? :)

I'm not aware of any filter that will fix this automatically.   Can you describe the grid a bit more?  It kind of looks like a multiblock of structured grids.

ftp://ftp.gfdl.noaa.gov/pub/sms/4ParaView/4.png is the latest nc file that I have of similar simulation preprocessed output. When I loaded it up, it is clearly doing making assumption on the grid that is not correct and hence, the double looking grid.

The questions now are:

1. ParaView has lots of *.nc file loader. How do I know which loader is ParaView using to load the data? If I pick a type for the Files of type option in the open File window, will that gurantees that ParaView will be using that particular file loader?

If there is an ambiguity for which file loader to use (i.e. multiple readers assume the same extension), then the GUI should pop up a dialog for you to specify which one to use.  You can use the python trace to figure out exactly what reader is being used to load the file.


2. If I know which loader is used, I would like to see if I can modify the existing loader to create a new type of *.nc file loader to fix the grid of my data. Where is the code in the source tree of ParaView is the loader plugin placed?
Based on the name of the name of the reader from the python script, you can look up the actual class name in the ParaView/Servers/ServerManager/Resources/readers.xml file.


or if there is an easier solution to fix my grid problem that doesn't involve developing a new data loader plugin that would be better.... :)  please let me know...

Hello,

However, after the file metadata is read by ::RequestInformation(), there are no scalar attributes shown in "Object Inspector" -> "Properties" illustrated in Empty_Object_Inspector_Properties.PNG. After click "Apply", :: RequestData() gets all the attribute data and displays the information in "Object Inspector" -> "Information" -> "Data Arrays" table as shown in Updated_Object_Inspector_Information.PNG. After the data is read, "Properties" page is still empty. Would you please suggest what I should do? Any functions that I should implement or call in my reader class? Thanks a lot.

Best,
xunlei

Subject: [Paraview] cpack error
Message-ID: <000701cbe865$39595d90$ac0c18b0$@Rogge@tu-cottbus.de>

Hello David,

I have the same problem as Koen mentioned. In my case I had compiled
ParaView 3.10 
on Windows 7 with Visual Studio 2008. Everything is fine and I can run the
compiled 
version. But packaging with CPack results in the same error message but at
another 
position. I send you the last part of CPacks output (notice that I replaced
some 
DLLs with dots, just to avoid a huge text here):

;external prerequisites found:

CPack Error: Error when generating package: ParaView


I followed your advice to deactivate PARAVIEW_INSTALL_THIRD_PARTY_LIBRARIES.

After this step I was able to compile and pack ParaView. But I could not
start 
ParaView because it request MSVC80P.DLL. It seems to me after disabling 
PARAVIEW_INSTALL_THIRD_PARTY_LIBRARIES a wrong compile runtime environment 
has been choose by Visual Studio.


Thanks for help.

Cheers,
Stephan

Message-ID: <4D887D13.4060803@DLR.de>

Hi,

i tried to compile the 3.10 release of ParaView. Without pyton, 
everything is fine. However, enabling python, i got the output below.

Any ideas / suggestions?

Hi Stefan,

I am going to CC David Gobbi as he recently gave the Wrapping a major face

Hi Ken,

Thank you again for your help.

Is there another wiki page that also describe all the xml used syntax in the
http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/ParaView/Plugin_HowTo ? It may help for me to have
an overall picture of the xml syntax used? thanks. And is there a complete
example out there that show the whole process on how one can create a custom
data loader plugin into ParaView? Not sure if I am saying this correctly but
something like, say I have this data file in my own format that has grid
information and a scalar variable. How do I write a data loader plugin so
that I can use ParaView to visualize the data. Then if I have to guess,
first you write this xml file to describe the data loader plugin to ParaView
and then use use sort of utility to generate the plugin standard code, and
then implement the function in the code to load and create your vtk data
structure (grid data type and scalar variable data type) and then pass it to
ParaView.  something like that?  thanks...

yes. it make sense that it is a part of VTK. ParaView is to expose VTK
functionality after all.

good thing is, I think we settle on a single large nc file that has all the
information needed to plot the visualization, including tripolar grid
information. Hopefully that will simplify things for me.

I am sorry that the ftp site is not behaving. I have placed the files at
http://www.cs.uh.edu/~ssu/4ParaView together with the nc file I used to
generate the image 4.png (what looks like a double grid to me) and 5.png
(coloring by the variable zos  which I don't thin it should look like that
)  Hopefully vtkNetCDFCFReader will do the job for me.

thanks
-simon

Hi,

I am a new user of paraview. There is a simple channel and I want
to see the x velocity profile of inlet and outlet in a single plot.

I can get the profiles for each one separately through the filter of "plot
on line"
But it is highly desirable to have both in a single plot for comparison.

Thanks,
Ali

Message-ID: <C9AE3F62.3367%kmorel@sandia.gov>

Simon,

After taking a look at your zos_*.nc file, I believe the problem is that the bounds variables (specifically lon_vertices and lat_vertices) are incorrect and causing malformed cells.  The proper format for these variables according to the CF convention is documented here ? http://cf-pcmdi.llnl.gov/documents/cf-conventions/1.5/ch07.html#cell-boundaries ? under "Bounds for 2-D coordinate variables with 4-sided cells".  These variables are referred to as lonbnd and latbnd in the CF documentation, but otherwise the name is inconsequential.

These bounds variables are supposed to contain a 4-tuple for each cell in the grid.  The 4 values in each tuple specify the longitude or latitude coordinates in counterclockwise order starting with the "lower left" value.  Adjacent cells should have duplicate longitude and latitude coordinates where appropriate.

So, assuming that the bounds of the first cell (which I am extrapolating from other coordinate variables in the zos file) is ?280 to ?279 in the longitude direction and ?82 to ?81 in the latitude direction, then the first 4-tuple in lon_vertices should be [?280, ?279, ?279, ?280] and the first tuple in lat_vertices should be [?82, ?82, ?81, ?81].  The next entries in the lon_vertices and lat_vertices arrays are for the adjacent cell in the horizontal direction and should be [?279, ?278, ?278, ?279] and [?82, ?82, ?81, ?81], respectively.

In this regard, the values stored in zon*.nc's lon_vertices and lat_vertices are nonsensical.  ncdump shows the first two entries of each as:

 lon_vertices =
  -280, -279, -278, -277,
  -276, -275, -274, -273,

 lat_vertices =
  -82, -82, -82, -82,
  -82, -82, -82, -82,

As you can see, these bounds do not form proper quadrilaterals.  They are all degenerate polygons on the ?82 latitude coordinate.  My guess is that whatever wrote out this file mistook the format for boundary variables for coordinate variables.

Subject: Re: [Paraview] loading nc formatted data

Hi Ken,

Thank you again for your help.

Is there another wiki page that also describe all the xml used syntax in the http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/ParaView/Plugin_HowTo ? It may help for me to have an overall picture of the xml syntax used? thanks. And is there a complete example out there that show the whole process on how one can create a custom data loader plugin into ParaView? Not sure if I am saying this correctly but something like, say I have this data file in my own format that has grid information and a scalar variable. How do I write a data loader plugin so that I can use ParaView to visualize the data. Then if I have to guess, first you write this xml file to describe the data loader plugin to ParaView and then use use sort of utility to generate the plugin standard code, and then implement the function in the code to load and create your vtk data structure (grid data type and scalar variable data type) and then pass it to ParaView.  something like that?  thanks...

yes. it make sense that it is a part of VTK. ParaView is to expose VTK functionality after all.

good thing is, I think we settle on a single large nc file that has all the information needed to plot the visualization, including tripolar grid information. Hopefully that will simplify things for me.

I am sorry that the ftp site is not behaving. I have placed the files at http://www.cs.uh.edu/~ssu/4ParaView together with the nc file I used to generate the image 4.png (what looks like a double grid to me) and 5.png (coloring by the variable zos  which I don't thin it should look like that )  Hopefully vtkNetCDFCFReader will do the job for me.

thanks

It looks like the documentation for a reader plugin is slightly messed up.  I'll leave it to Andy (or anyone who is not me) to fix.  The example in the ParaView source does not list a file in SERVER_MANAGER_SOURCES because it uses a source (vtkPNGReader.cxx) that is already compiled as part of VTK.  The Wiki is trying to capture the fact that usually you are building a plugin with your own reader, and you will have to list your source code for the reader there.  vtkMyPNGReader.cxx is just a stand in for some reader that you wrote.  It probably does not really exist.  I noticed, however, that the Wiki documentation is also wrong in that the XML file is pointing to the vtkPNGReader class when the CMake configuration is implying that it should be pointing to the (imaginary) vtkMyPNGReader class.

The vtkNetCDFCFReader.cxx file is located in ParaView/VTK/IO/vtkNetCDFCFReader.cxx.  Don't get too wrapped up around the complexity of the NetCDF reader definition in readers.xml.  It's complicated because it supports defining a time series as a collection of files (http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/Animating_legacy_VTK_file_series#Making_custom_readers_work_with_file_series).  If you collect all times in a single netCDF file (or don't have time steps), you can skip all that and just define a new object much like that of netCDFReaderCore in reader.xml (in the sources ProxyGroup of course).

That said, I think this should all be unnecessary since the CF convention (and ParaView reader) already contains a means of defining cells that bridge across these seems.  I suspect it has nothing to do with the CF convention version.  It is probably that your data files with openings at the seems are not defining a bounds attribute, which is optional in CF.  If you could post some example data (or even the listing of the file header from ncdump) I might be able to verify that.

I'm not sure what is going on with the new data set (4.png).  I can't comment on it much because your ftp server seems to be broken for me and I don't remember the image too well.  At any rate, I would probably say something like I couldn't tell you what was going on without seeing the nc file.

Subject: Re: [Paraview] loading nc formatted data

Hi Ken,

Thank you for explaining.

The reader that is being used is vtkNetCDFCFReader.  It is defined in ParaView/Servers/ServerManager/Resources/readers.xml, although it is not obvious.


Can you (or Andy) point me to documentation more documentation beside http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/ParaView/Plugin_HowTo ? Andy also metioned readers.xml file you mentioned. But after going through ParaView/Servers/
ServerManager/Resources/readers.xml, I am still fuzzy about where the file vtkNetCDFCFReader.cxx ( if any -  I would like to know how it is implemented and maybe start by modifying it in my learning process). The plugin wiki page on "Adding a Reader" section mentioned CMakeList.txt file


FIND_PACKAGE(ParaView REQUIRED)
INCLUDE(${PARAVIEW_USE_FILE})
 ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN(MyReader "1.0"


   SERVER_MANAGER_XML MyPNGReader.xml
   SERVER_MANAGER_SOURCES vtkMyPNGReader.cxx
   GUI_RESOURCE_FILES MyReaderGUI.xml)

but the one on my source tree ParaView-3.10.0/Examples/Plugins/Reader/CMakeList.txt looks like

  ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN(MyPNGReader "1.0"
    SERVER_MANAGER_XML readers.xml
    GUI_RESOURCE_FILES pqReader.xml
    )

note no vtkMyPNGReader.cxx file mention and the file is also not in the directory.  I also did a search on source tree for vtkNetCDFCFReader.cxx file but can't find it. I think I am missing a big piece of something  since I am not getting the point that I should be getting after looking at readers.xml. In fact, I can't find any of the netcdf file readers (other than CF reader). It is also not listed under my Plugin Manager GUI on the ParaView that I compiled but it is loading the CF convention nc file. Are they (the *.cxx files) generated on the fly during compile time?

Another thing, besides http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/VisIt_Database_Bridge , is there a place that I can find how to use that VisIt bridge in ParaView. Maybe an example of how to load silo file? I actually have a plugin of my own in VisIt that can load the climate modeling data that I have. I would like to see if I can use my VisIt plugin in ParaView and not write another plugin for ParaView? :)


As the name implies, this reader reads netCDF files using the CF convention.  (As the default netCDF reader, it also gracefully handles files that do not follow this convention.) With this assumption, I will try to explain what it does.  It reads arrays as regular 1, 2, or 3D arrays, possibly with time.  The CF convention also provides a means to assign coordinates to each grid point and to identify the coordinates as longitude or latitude.


The published nc files we have do adhere to CF convention we also use CMOR in one of the pipeline. I noticed  Data_tos_O1_2001-2002.nc is at CF-1.0 and since I am new at CF Convention, I can only speculate that what I see at ftp://ftp.gfdl.noaa.gov/pub/sms/4ParaView/4.png with what looks like double grid is due to difference between CF-1.0 and CF-1.4? Will vtkNetCDFCFReader handle CF-1.4 data?



Even though coordinates are defined as longitude and latitude, the topology of the grid itself is still a grid.  Thus, the grid gets wrapped around, but still has these seems that you see because topologically the one end of the regular grid is not attached to the other.  I can't think of any filter that will identify and close these seems.  In fact, it's not straightforward to do at all.  If you look at your topology, it is not lain out on a simple spherical grid.

The "right" way to solve your problem, which may or may not be in your control, is to create netCDF files that specify cell boundaries for a closed topology.  Your netCDF file must be following at least some parts of the CF convention; your data would not show up as a sphere if it were not.  The CF convention provides a way of defining cells that are not constrained by a regular grid topology.  It is done through a "bounds" attribute on the dimension descriptor variables.  You need either 1D or 2D bounds.  They are described in this section of the CF convention documentation: http://cf-pcmdi.llnl.gov/documents/cf-conventions/1.5/cf-conventions.html#cell-boundaries.


Agreed. The hack we have in VisIt loader (replace the last grid value with the 1st grid value to create a "closed topology" ) is not "generalizable" and will blow up in my face if I hand it to the user.


thanks
-simon




The VTK test data has examples of both 1D bounds (tos_O1_2001-2002.nc) and 2D bounds (sampleCurveGrid4.nc).  You can get the VTK test data from git (http://vtk.org/VTKData.git), or download them directly from the gitourious server:

I'm not aware of any filter that will fix this automatically.   Can you describe the grid a bit more?  It kind of looks like a multiblock of structured grids.

The questions now are:

If there is an ambiguity for which file loader to use (i.e. multiple readers assume the same extension), then the GUI should pop up a dialog for you to specify which one to use.  You can use the python trace to figure out exactly what reader is being used to load the file.


2. If I know which loader is used, I would like to see if I can modify the existing loader to create a new type of *.nc file loader to fix the grid of my data. Where is the code in the source tree of ParaView is the loader plugin placed?
Based on the name of the name of the reader from the python script, you can look up the actual class name in the ParaView/Servers/ServerManager/Resources/readers.xml file.


or if there is an easier solution to fix my grid problem that doesn't involve developing a new data loader plugin that would be better.... :)  please let me know...

Hi Ken,

This is great. I will work with the scientific programming team that came up
with the file to see if we can go anywhere with it.  Thank you so much for
taking the time to look into the file.

Subject: [Paraview] Getting a raytraced picture from Manta
Message-ID: <775603.78989.qm@web36505.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hi,

I have been able to get Manta raytracer to compile with paraview and load in as a plugin.? I even see the extra GUI options in the "display" tab of certain filters like the Tube filter.? I'm just wondering how to get something raytraced as a result.

I did a bit a research via the list and found a page that says that I must start the paraview server with the plugin loaded.? The client would also have the plugin loaded and connect to the server. The instructions didn't say how to do that on the server side .? Usually when I start the paraview server (pvserver), it does not launch the GUI but just waits for a client connection in the terminal.? So I don't know how to load the plugin on the server...the command line options for pvserver didn't provide any hints.

Please advise.

Thanks, Sohail

Hi Sohail,

you should just close the default 3D view and create the Manta one by
clicking on its button.
Then any object that you create will be shown in that raytracer view... And
with the latest implementation, you don't need a remote server anymore.

Thanks.? It turns out that I am working with an older version (3.8.0) since I am making preparations for a paper (due next week) and some code hasn't been ported to latest version yet.

I basically have to add the plugins in the "Remote plugins" section o fthe Plugin manager.? The plugin's a bit buggy and causes a crash, however, and I think that may be due to the fact that I am using an older version of Manta.

Hi?Sohail,
you should just close the default 3D view and create the Manta one by clicking on its button.
Then any object that you create will be shown in that raytracer view... And with the latest implementation, you don't need a remote server anymore.

Hi,

I have been able to get Manta raytracer to compile with paraview and load in as a plugin.? I even see the extra GUI options in the "display" tab of certain filters like the Tube filter.? I'm just wondering how to get something raytraced as a result.


I did a bit a research via the list and found a page that says that I must start the paraview server with the plugin loaded.? The client would also have the plugin loaded and connect to the server. The instructions didn't say how to do that on the server side .? Usually when I start the paraview server (pvserver), it does not launch the GUI but just waits for a client connection in the terminal.? So I don't know how to load the plugin on the server...the command line options for pvserver didn't provide any hints.


Please advise.

Thanks,
 Sohail

Hi Sohail,

if you are using 3.8.0, it is true that you will need to start a server
(pvserver) and connect to it to allow manta to work "properly" with
ParaView. You don't need to run in MPI, but it has to be in a different
process than the client. (I mean no built-in mode)
On the other hand, once you get connected to that pvserver (in localhost for
example) you will have to load the plugin on both side (client+server). Once
this is done, you should be able to close the 3D renderer and create a new
one based on Manta.

For the crash part, the best person will be Dave that I cc. But as he is
traveling, he might not be able to answer to you right away.

I highly recommend you use Manta r2439. As far as vtkManta's use of Manta
goes, that version is the most stable and newer Manta versions are known to
cause it to crash.

Thank you...that version is actually way more stable, and I can see that the raytracer is working now.? Phong shading does work (I was able to pick that successfully), and it works better than the rasterized Gouraud (as expected).? I just don't see any shadows cast created on the polygons my filter created, I think that would be seen by default. Any ideas?

Subject: [Paraview] open an in-memory vtk file
Message-ID: <BAY148-w294066F6F5ADC889A73DB9C3B70@phx.gbl>


I made a client-server paraview system, from the client I ask to the server to open a vtk file, render it and give back render to the client. It's working well.

But now, my boss said that we'll have a vtk file generated by an other program that'll be about 100Go and we don't want to write it to HDD in .vtk formate and after read it ( like before ), so I need to read the vtk file directly from memory.

Is there a way to give to a reader a pointer to the memory vtk file ?

PS: I'm not sure that this is very understandable but I'm not sure myself ... The main thing is that we make a vtk file in memory but don't want to write it in HDD. ( First solution envisaged is to dump memory. )

Thanks.

Subject: [Paraview] visualizing particles with different radius
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=dRZjr5RWaT3+0CQXav782HqpVKC2LM+7hq4cg@mail.gmail.com>

I have produced *.vtk files which contain information about
6 coordinates in Cartesian space and radius of the particles. the particles
have two different type. type 1 with radius 1 and type 2 with radius 5. each
time i apply Glyph filter and choose sphere type only one  type of
the particles is changed. how is it possible to apply this filter to both
types or even if i had three type with tree different radii how could
i visualize these tree diffident radii?
thanks.

Message-ID: <AANLkTi=krXpj+cM37M_oCGuaxRdGKuQfYMfHJ7gLBz79@mail.gmail.com>

If I have an information_only property with a command to get a
vtkStringArray, is there a way to pass a parameter to the fuction? And, can
that parameter be from another property? Otherwise, it seems that I would
need to push the variable to the server in order for it to be available for
the command called from the information_only property.

Thanks,

So in the glyph filter's "Vectors" drop-down you see the two types and you want it applied to both?? If that's the case then I would add a second glyph filter into the pipeline, and have it applied to the other type. As far as I know each glyph filter can be applied to only one input vector from the pipeline.

Unfortunately that's the way you have to do it. Or the other way is to
use GatherInformation() but it won't be much better.

Okay, my attempt to push the variable to the server using
immediate_update="1" seems to not update the server variable when I change
my current index of a combobox. I also tried to call Modified() on the
currentIndexChanged event, but it seems to ignore the changes from the GUI
and reset the combobox as if I just loaded it.

How should I be pushing the variable to the server?

Hi Brian,

could you send the (part of) XML proxy definition and the piece of
code you are calling to that proxy to make that push...
So I could be sure that both side are corrects.

Thanks,

Seb

Subject: [Paraview]  Accessing object properties
Message-ID: <002201cbe978$444e4a80$cceadf80$@Rogge@tu-cottbus.de>

Hello,

With the new ParaView version (3.10) it's now possible to select an object
within the 3D view. What is the best way to get access to its properties
e.g. transformation or color and how I can modify it. Is it right to get the
active source object like this:

	pqActiveObjects* object	= &(pqActiveObjects::instance());
	pqPipelineSource* src	= object->activeSource();

?

Some years ago, there was a discussion here in the mailing list about
transforming objects right in the GUI and I was not able to find a similar
thread for this topic. What is the state of this feature?

Cheers,
Stephan

This XML is of two comboboxes, where the first depends on the second's
selection.
XML:
            <StringVectorProperty
                name="DataTypeList"
                command="GetReaderDataTypeList"
                information_only="1">
                <StringArrayHelper />
            </StringVectorProperty>
            <StringVectorProperty
                name="cbDataType"
                command="SetReaderDataType"
                immediate_update="1"
                number_of_elements="1">
                <StringListDomain name="operation">
                    <RequiredProperties>
                        <Property name="DataTypeList"
                            function="ArraySelection"/>
                    </RequiredProperties>
                </StringListDomain>
            </StringVectorProperty>

            <StringVectorProperty
                name="TypeList"
                command="GetReaderTypeList"
                information_only="1">
                <StringArrayHelper />
            </StringVectorProperty>
            <StringVectorProperty
                name="cbType"
                command="SetReaderType"
                immediate_update="1"
                number_of_elements="1">
                <StringListDomain name="operation">
                    <RequiredProperties>
                        <Property name="TypeList"
                            function="ArraySelection"/>
                    </RequiredProperties>
                </StringListDomain>
            </StringVectorProperty>


When a currentIndexChanged event in cbType occurs, it sends a signal to the
typeChanged() slot.

Code:
void
myclass::typeChanged()
{
    this->proxy()->GetProperty("cbType")->Modified();
    vtkSMProperty* prop = this->proxy()->GetProperty("DataTypeList");
    this->proxy()->UpdatePropertyInformation(prop);
}

What ends up happening is that when I change the combobox for cbType from
index 1 to index 2, typeChanged() is called, but is sending the 1st value to
SetReaderType. It looks like it refeshes but remains index1. Thus, the
DataTypeList is populated with the same information it had.

When I remove the Modified() line, the combobox for cbType will show the
change from index 1 to index 2, but SetReaderType does not get called.

Any idea why that is happening?

Thanks,

Brian

I have an Exodus II type file loaded into Paraview and trying to get the
point ID for a group of cells. I know for vtk type object there are
functions like GetCell(), GetPoint() and just wonder if there are such kind
of routines available for Exodus II files.

I assume you're talking about using Python from ParaView?

Yes, the ExodusII reader outputs VTK objects in a multiblock dataset.  
You can use GetCell(), GetPoint(), and such on each individual  
block... you just have to decide on a particular block. The ExodusII  
reader separates things into blocks because each one may have  
different point and/or cell variables. There are actually 2 levels of  
blocks; the top level segregates datasets into groups that correspond  
to exodus blocks vs. sets. The second level breaks individual blocks  
or sets into separate datasets. Does that help?

I am new in dealing with ex2 file, could you please be detailed? There is
just one block in the dataset, so how to get the vtk object out from it so I
can access the points and cells?

There are 2 ways to use Python in ParaView: writing a programmable  
filter and scripting the user interface. The former is evaluated on  
the server where you can get access to (at least a portion of) the  
actual dataset. The latter is evaluated on the client, which does not  
have access to the datasets -- instead it has proxy objects that send  
messages to the servers, telling them what to do. So, you can access  
the points and cells from within a programmable filter, but not from  
within a client-side script.

See the section of this page
   http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/Python_Programmable_Filter
named "Dealing with Composite Datasets". It describes how to iterate  
over all of the blocks in the dataset and run a function (in this  
case, one named "flatten") on each block.

Thanks again, and I took a look on the programmable filter code. In my case
the block consists of more than 1 million tetrahedrons and it will be time
consuming to run iterations. Is there a way that I can export the cells and
their corresponding point information to a numpy array? The ultimate goal is
to calculate the volume of each tetrahedron.

There is a VTK-numpy bridge which is documented on the wiki. I don't  
recall exactly where but I'm sure a search engine will find it for you.

Hi Richard,
Downloaded the linux binaries again, however, I had the same issue. However, I had access to a version of tecplot (tec360 (2009)) and saved the file as an updated version. This version then loaded into Paraview.

The original file had a tecplot version string of #!TDV102 compared with #!TDV112. Therefore I guess there is a limitation on the versions of tecplot files that are accepted by the reader.

Regards,
Chris Butler

However, this error still appears with the Windows binaries. If you are on Linux, please try to re-download the binaries. If your are on Windows, you should wait for PV 3.10.1 (See the discussion about the CGNS reader).

Thanks David, I made a programmable filter and got it running. It works.

Now I have a new question, how to get a point_data array from a ex2 object?

For vtk object, I know I can fetch it to local, like

from paraview.simple import servermanager as sm
data=sm.Fetch(reader)

Then there is data.GetPointData().GetArray(). But I could not find such
routines when I tried to do the same to ex2 object.

Any idea?

Phong shading does work (I was able to pick that successfully), and it works better than the rasterized Gouraud (as expected).? I just don't see any shadows cast created on the polygons my filter created, I think that would be seen by default. Any ideas?

I highly recommend you use Manta?r2439. As far as vtkManta's use of Manta goes, that version is the most stable and newer Manta versions are known to cause it to crash.

Hi?Sohail,
if you are using 3.8.0, it is true that you will need to start a server (pvserver) and connect to it to allow manta to work "properly" with ParaView. You don't need to run in MPI, but it has to be in a different process than the client. (I mean no built-in mode)



On the other hand, once you get connected to that pvserver (in localhost for example) you will have to load the plugin on both side (client+server). Once this is done, you should be able to close the 3D renderer and create a new one based on Manta.




For the crash part, the best person will be Dave that I cc. But as he is traveling, he might not be able to answer to you right away.

Thanks.? It turns out that I am working with an older version (3.8.0) since I am making preparations for a paper (due next week) and some code hasn't been ported to latest version yet.




I basically have to add the plugins in the "Remote plugins" section o fthe Plugin manager.? The plugin's a bit buggy and causes a crash, however, and I think that may be due to the fact that I am using an older version of Manta.

Hi?Sohail,




you should just close the default 3D view and create the Manta one by clicking on its button.
Then any object that you create will be shown in that raytracer view... And with the latest implementation, you don't need a remote server anymore.

Hi,

I have been able to get Manta raytracer to compile with paraview and load in as a plugin.? I even see the extra GUI options in the "display" tab of certain filters like the Tube filter.? I'm just wondering how to get something raytraced as a result.






I did a bit a research via the list and found a page that says that I must start the paraview server with the plugin loaded.? The client would also have the plugin loaded and connect to the server. The instructions didn't say how to do that on the server side .? Usually when I start the paraview server (pvserver), it does not launch the GUI but just waits for a client connection in the terminal.? So I don't know how to load the plugin on the server...the command line options for pvserver didn't provide any hints.






Please advise.

Thanks,
 Sohail

Hi Chris.

I tried to write Tecplot binary files with Tecplot 360 2009 and Tecplot 
360 2010, and both saved files have the same version number #!TDV112 and 
they can be loaded with PV 3.10.0.

But an old Tecplot binary file with the version number #!TDV71 can also 
be loaded with PV 3.10.0. !

So the Tecplot version number does not seem to be the problem, at least 
from 71 to 112. Could your original file have been corrupted ?

Richard.

Richard & Adriano,
I am absolutely certain that the file is actually a data file .plt. I am also sure that the file is valid for tecplot (it loaded into tecplot). I can send you a sample file if that would be informative.

Chris & Adriano,

I used a binary editor to modify my Tecplot 360 2010 "*.plt" binary file 
and I replaced the version number TDV112 by TDV102... and I got the same 
error as Chris!!!!

Indeed, the TDV102 version number is not understood by Paraview, 
although the older version number TDV71 can be loaded !

Strange...

Richard.

Hello,

I would like to thank all of you for tracking down the issue behind
this bug, would one of you be willing to create a bug report of the
version error. I will try to fix this for the next major release.

Hi Brian,

I'm not sure to understand your UI and the way the things are.
It might be overkill, but if you want to express those dependency, you
can create your own domain based on what it is filled so far so at
start only TypeList will be available, then "TypeList + DataTypeList"
and then "TypeList + DataTypeList + DataList"
Other than that, I don't know if it is possible to change the order...

Subject: [Paraview] How to compare 2 vtk files using paraview?
Message-ID: <BAY147-w36F9E90EC1516ABB104CA4F0B60@phx.gbl>


Hi, 
 
I have 2 vtk files where the nodes point is different for each vtk file.  Is there a way to compare the data point by point.  
I am particularly interested in finding the percentage difference between the 2 data.  
Thanks
 
Best Regards

Message-ID: <4D8B622B.9090200@sara.nl>

Hi,

Is there in PV (3.8 / 3.10) a quick way to switch between orthographic 
and perspective projection? The only method I see is going through the 
menu (Edit -> View settings -> General -> Use Parallel Projection).

Thanks,
Paul

Hi Andy, thanks.... :)

Ken, the newer version produced by the scientific programming team has some
improvement. But the crack along the north pole (tripolar poles between Asia
and America continent) is still there. I saved a screenshot at
http://www.cs.uh.edu/~ssu/4ParaView/20110324/1.png

the data file is a little more than 800MB if you can get to

ftp://ftp.gfdl.noaa.gov/pub/sms/4ParaView/20110324/thetao_Omon_GFDL-ESM2M_historical_r1i1p1_194601-195012.nc

I don't think it is right but I have don't have a point of reference. If you
have the time, can you point me to the data file which is proper or a screen
shot of a properly rendered vis of the CF convention file?

thank you very much
-simon

I was able to get it working by using SetElement and setting the currentText
retreived from the widget. Then I called UpdateProperty on the first
combobox. Next I called UpdatePropertyInformation on the second combobox.
For the order issue, I just ended up renaming them so they followed the
order I needed.

Thanks,

Subject: [Paraview] QListWidget Selection Issue
Message-ID: <AANLkTin_oBRQQ6hmD0DDtHEjrqwX96wj-vFcNSh8hm2Y@mail.gmail.com>

I have a QListWidget that is being filled by the following XML:

           <StringVectorProperty
                name="w3_DataList"
                command="GetReaderDataList"
                information_only="1">
                <StringArrayHelper />
            </StringVectorProperty>
            <StringVectorProperty
                name="w3_lbData"
                immediate_update="1"
                number_of_elements="0"
                repeat_command="1"
                number_of_elements_per_command="2"
                element_types="2 0"
                command="SetReaderData">
                <ArraySelectionDomain name="operation">
                    <RequiredProperties>
                        <Property name="w3_DataList"
                            function="ArrayList"/>
                    </RequiredProperties>
                </ArraySelectionDomain>
            </StringVectorProperty>

Everything seems to show up as expected, but I end up getting the following
error:

"had to make up a value for selection"

How can I provide a default for the selection?

Thanks,
Brian Panneton

Hi Utkarsh,

I'd also like to see a coded example of this in action. If you have something, could you post it to the list.

Many thanks,

Owen.

Hi Utkarsh,

 Thanks for the response. It would be greatly appreciated if you have the
time to provide some code for setting up the implicit plane. I have
continued to try and diagnose things myself without much luck.

Thanks,

Hello,
I am writing a reader plugin for ParaView following examples in
http://www.kitware.com/products/html/WritingAParaViewReaderPlug-in.html
However, after the file metadata is read by ::RequestInformation(), there are no scalar attributes shown in "Object Inspector" -> "Properties" illustrated in Empty_Object_Inspector_Properties.PNG. After click "Apply", :: RequestData() gets all the attribute data and displays the information in "Object Inspector" -> "Information" -> "Data Arrays" table as shown in Updated_Object_Inspector_Information.PNG. After the data is read, "Properties" page is still empty. Would you please suggest what I should do? Any functions that I should implement or call in my reader class? Thanks a lot.

Is there specific syntax required to set the name of each block within a

ignored as the blocks are still named generically as Data Set 0, Data Set 1,
etc. I've done a fair bit of searching but failed to find any reference to

Xunlei,

There is no auto-generation of GUI elements for the properties tab of a
reader. Your reader has to populate the tab.
Are you looking for something like "Cell/Point Array Status" to pop up
in the properties tab? Like the VTU-XML Reader and many others offer?
Such that you can select the variables to actually import or ignore
while loading, respectively?

Karl

Xunlei,

Have a look at VTK/IO/vtkAVSucdReader.{h,cxx}, that's a simple
self-contained reader. You'll need to integrate everything (headers,
methods, code blocks etc.) mentioning "DataArraySelection" into your reader.

By the way, don't let yourself confuse by the fact that that particular
reader currently does only fill "Cell/Point Array Status" for binary AVS
UCD files (vtkdata-5.6.1.zip:Data/cellsnd.bin.inp), but not for ASCII
AVS UCD files (vtkdata-5.6.1.zip:Data/cellsnd.ascii.inp)

I believe the functionality is missing. I have looked for it for many years.

I just put together a quick hack, which seems to work fine for me. No exhaustive testing was done. It works for my test data, which are multi-blocks of multi-blocks. It could be generalized to multi-pieces too. I'll let a Kitware guru do that. :-)

I modified VTK/IO/vtkXMLMultiBlockDataReader.cxx to get the attribute "name"

    // child is a leaf node, read and insert.
    const char* tagName = childXML->GetName();
    if (strcmp(tagName, "DataSet") == 0)
      {
      vtkSmartPointer<vtkDataSet> childDS;
      const char* name;
      if (this->ShouldReadDataSet(dataSetIndex))
        {
        // Read
        childDS.TakeReference(this->ReadDataset(childXML, filePath));
        name = childXML->GetAttribute("name");
        }
      // insert
      if (mblock)
        {
        mblock->SetBlock(index, childDS);
        mblock->GetMetaData(index)->Set(vtkCompositeDataSet::NAME(), name);
        }
      else if (mpiece)
        {
        mpiece->SetPiece(index, childDS);
        }
      dataSetIndex++;
      }
    // Child is a multiblock dataset itself. Create it.
    else if (mblock != 0
             && strcmp(tagName, "Block") == 0)
      {
      vtkMultiBlockDataSet* childDS = vtkMultiBlockDataSet::New();;
      this->ReadComposite(childXML, childDS, filePath, dataSetIndex);
      const char* name = childXML->GetAttribute("name");
      if (mblock)
        {

Jean,

I had a look at the source too and came to the same conclusion. Admittedly,
I was quite surprised considering it is such a important feature of
multi-block data storage. Thank you for providing code to handle it though.
I'll make changes and test to make sure it works here and update you. 

Thanks,

Adriano

It looks like your "v," "f" and "omega" arrays (inputs to the glyph filter) cover the same set of points here. Each of them have 117 tuples. You want one glyph filter to apply to all points? Have you tried playing around with the "Scale mode"?? I was able to get all the points to become spheres to become spheres that way.

thanks but as you sea in this vtk file there two types of atoms with different radius. i have tried applying two glyph filter but it only changes one type each time,,,

So in the glyph filter's "Vectors" drop-down you see the two types and you want it applied to both?? If that's the case then I would add a second glyph filter into the pipeline, and have it applied to the other type. As far as I know each glyph filter can be applied to only one input vector from the pipeline.

I have changed the XML to look as such:
[code]
            <StringVectorProperty
                name="w3_DataList"
                information_only="1">
                <ArraySelectionInformationHelper attribute_name="Data" />
            </StringVectorProperty>
            <StringVectorProperty
                name="w3_lbData"
                command="SetDataArrayStatus"
                number_of_elements="0"
                repeate_command="1"
                number_of_elements_per_command="2"
                element_types="2 0">
                <ArraySelectionDomain name="array_list">
                    <RequiredProperties>
                        <Property name="w3_DataList"
                            function="ArrayList"/>
                    </RequiredProperties>
                </ArraySelectionDomain>
            </StringVectorProperty>
[/code]

This seems to be more of what I need. I also implemented the following
functions:
[code]
    int GetNumberOfDataArrays();
    const char* GetDataArrayName(int index);
    int GetDataArrayStatus(const char* name);
    void SetDataArrayStatus(const char* name, int status);
[/code]

When my reader loads the file, I still get the error:
     "had to make up a value for selection"

Also, when I call accept(), I get this message which I am confused why
argument 3 is a string.
[error]
could not find requested method: "SetDataArrayStatus"
or the method was called with incorrect arguments.

while processing
Message 0 = Invoke
  Argument 0 = id_value {143}
  Argument 1 = string_value {SetDataArrayStatus}
  Argument 2 = string_value {Something}
  Argument 3 = string_value {1}
[/error]

Could this be due to using a QListWidget? If so, what should I be using?

Thanks,
Brian Panneton

I got rid of the error "had to make up a value for selection" by adding
    information_property="w3_DataList"
to StringVectorProperty w3_lbData. I still can't get the SetDataArrayStatus
to be called correctly. It still seems to want to make argument 3 a string.

Message-ID: <AANLkTi=wFM7to5Y4G=Di06GxDxQ043USLe0mo8vODb9Z@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,
I'd like to export a paraview vector field plot into a vectorial image
format (e.g. eps) to generate high quality images which are not huge
in size for publication purposes.
I already compiled paraview 3.10 with gl2ps=on. So according to old
messages in the email list I should be able to save vectorial images.
Could anybody give me instructions how to do that?

Thanks,
Nima.

Subject: [Paraview] Animated Streamlines
Message-ID: <4D8CBB1B.7050904@aeolus-consulting.eu>

Hi,

I have a steady state converged calculation, and I would like to do some 
animated streamlines of the flow in Paraview.
So, what I can do for now is to create streamlines, and "animate" some 
glyphs on these (giving "points moving along the streamlines") using the 
"Integration Time" in the animation panel. What I can also do is having 
"advancing streamlines", meaning that I animate the streamlines by 
ramping the maximum length... and gives streamlines starting from my 
defined seeds, and "advancing" in the domain as their maximum length is 
increased by the ramping.
Now, what I want is almost that, but with the seeding points (or line) 
also moving. It's hard to explain, and actually I just found a video of 
it, so here it is, this is exactly the kind of result I'm looking for : 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMBloUBoHgs

Is that possible ?

Thank you,

Arnaud

Jean,

Your fix works fine and pretty simple to implement. Should this be added as
a feature request or possibly a bug?

Subject: RE: [Paraview] Providing block names within .vtm files


I believe the functionality is missing. I have looked for it for many years.

I just put together a quick hack, which seems to work fine for me. No
exhaustive testing was done. It works for my test data, which are
multi-blocks of multi-blocks. It could be generalized to multi-pieces too.
I'll let a Kitware guru do that. :-)

I modified VTK/IO/vtkXMLMultiBlockDataReader.cxx to get the attribute "name"

    // child is a leaf node, read and insert.
    const char* tagName = childXML->GetName();
    if (strcmp(tagName, "DataSet") == 0)
      {
      vtkSmartPointer<vtkDataSet> childDS;
      const char* name;
      if (this->ShouldReadDataSet(dataSetIndex))
        {
        // Read
        childDS.TakeReference(this->ReadDataset(childXML, filePath));
        name = childXML->GetAttribute("name");
        }
      // insert
      if (mblock)
        {
        mblock->SetBlock(index, childDS);
        mblock->GetMetaData(index)->Set(vtkCompositeDataSet::NAME(), name);
        }
      else if (mpiece)
        {
        mpiece->SetPiece(index, childDS);
        }
      dataSetIndex++;
      }
    // Child is a multiblock dataset itself. Create it.
    else if (mblock != 0
             && strcmp(tagName, "Block") == 0)
      {
      vtkMultiBlockDataSet* childDS = vtkMultiBlockDataSet::New();;
      this->ReadComposite(childXML, childDS, filePath, dataSetIndex);
      const char* name = childXML->GetAttribute("name");
      if (mblock)
        {
        mblock->SetBlock(index, childDS);
        mblock->GetMetaData(index)->Set(vtkCompositeDataSet::NAME(), name);
        }
      else if (mpiece)
        {
        vtkErrorMacro("Multipiece data can't have composite children.");
        return;
        }
      childDS->Delete();
      }

Okay, I spelled repeat incorrectly. Once I corrected that everything works.

Although it is possible to build a plugin that is compatible with our
binaries (using our development libraries is the shortest path to that), I
recommend compiling from source instead.

I suspect that path will give you fewer headaches.

Does python trace capture that? If so, you can make a macro for each

vtkDataWriter and vtkDataReader have a method which tells them to write
to/read from a buffer rather than to a file. A plugin that makes use of that
is probably the quickest path to get started. Alternatively, XDMF has a
distributed shared memory option which was developed for the same purpose.

In either case you will also need some sort of synchronization so that the
reader never tries to read a partially written buffer.

can not show the exact time step. Could you tell me how to show the time
step in the animation and how to change the name of the time step. For

Hi,

I have started experimenting using the MantaView plugin (windows 32 bit). It does produce pretty renders but still needs a little work in stability.

Some functionality that seems to be broken is support for a vtk file sequence. When I increment the time (e.g. by hitting play) using the standard 3d viewer the file data shown is automatically updated but for MantaView this does not happen. Can this please be fixed?

Thanks for all the hard work.

Cheers,

Description of Problem.

We have a CFD solver that runs in parallel mode. Each partition runs a
portion of mesh just like other parallel CFD codes do. We wish to visualize
the data exported from this solver.
Since data sizes are very large, it is not possible for me to assemble the
data to 1 process and export single result file for post processing.
This means each processor can write its own result file. The calculation is
transient, this mean for given Np processors I shall have Np results files
for each time step.

Assume that , I can run paraview on equal number of processors. That means
Np paraviews running, such that each process can load 1 result file for
post processing.

Questions:

1. What format I shall export so that paraview can load, the way I
described above. I prefer binary format.
2. how to do it. Any hints would be useful.


Note that, I have books (any pointer where to look into them would be
great):
1. The Paraview Guide
2. The visualization toolkit (4th edition).
3. The VTK user's Guide.

Thank you very much.

Message-ID: <BFC6F607797EE4439A63CAC7BC43A1D105AE36@EXCHMBX01.fed.cclrc.ac.uk>

Hi,

I have a filter which executes some code in a third-party library, which takes a considerable time to run. I therefore use UpdateProgress and SetProgress text method calls to inform the users about the progress. This works fine the first time I 'Apply' my filter, correctly displaying both the progress percent and the supplied text. However, if I modify and then apply my filter again I do not get either progress or status text updates in the Paraview GUI. I'm definitely making the same calls to UpdateProgress and SetProgress text, but they are ignored on every execution apart from the first one.

Is there some sort of refresh operation I need to apply in my filter to get the Paraview GUI to display the progress?

Thanks in advance,

Owen.

In Paraview, in "Information" > "Data Arrays" there is a list of the data set of my vtk file (name,type,Data range).

But when I create a 'LegacyVTKFileReader', I give the inputFile, but how do I know number of dataSet , their names and how do I use one specifically ? ( Actually I automaticaly use the first dataSet )

Thanks in advance ! :-)

I think the problem maybe more on the ParaView side. Attached is a

If you are trying to change the units or otherwise linearly scale time
values, use the Temporal Shift Scale filter.

You can turn on the visibility for both the "Plot Over Line" filters
in the same plot view to see both the curves in the same plot.

Agata,

ParaView is not designed for such kinds of operations, so there are no
easy ways for doing these in ParaView.

Subject: [Paraview] Reading In 2D Statistical Data
Message-ID: <AANLkTimafG3MYiqM+eZPwKJhoVc0Or_ueCs1-m9Ek9Bi@mail.gmail.com>

I am making a reader that will be reading in a bunch of X Y statistics. At
first I was reading them into a vtkTable which then I could run the 'Plot
Data' filter and get a 2D line chart. I was wondering if there was a better
way to do this. I want to try to use something like vtkPolyData, but I can't
seem to figure out if there is a way to include details about the
statistics, such as its title, the name of each line or other string data.

A quick example would be if I wanted to plot 2 statistics (A and B). A has 3
lines and B has 2 lines. I need some way to differentiate which statistic
and which line each of the plotted lines are.

In the vtkTable, I made a column for X, and then a column for each stat/line
pair (X,A1,A2,A3,B1,B2), but I feel like there is a better way to do this.

Thanks,
Brian Panneton

I am not sure why you'd want to use a vtkPolyData. In fact, what
you're doing with vtkTable seems very reasonable to me.

I run into an issue of traversing my data multiple times in order to place
it into the table. I would need to run through each line of each statistic
just to figure out how many columns are needed. Then do it all again in
order to fill the table. Where as if I could use vtkPolyLine, I only need to
run through everything once.

Also, the stats I am reading in may not have the same Xs. For instance,

Stat1:Line1 may be as follow:
(X,Y) - (1,5),(2,10),(3,15)
Stat1:Line2 may be as follows
(X,Y) - (1,2),(5,10),(10,1)
Stat2:Line1 may be as follows
(X,Y) - (1,2),(3,10),(5,1),(10,1)

so when I put it into the table I get Xs as 1,2,3,5,10. Then line one will
have 5,10 with Y values of 0 and line 2 will have 2,3 with Y values of 0. So
when plotted, line two will show (2,0) instead of (2,4).

Is there a better way to construct my table where I could avoid these
issues?

Thanks,
Brian Panneton

I think the problem maybe more on the ParaView side. Attached is a patch. Can you verify if that resolves the issue?

I would:

1) See if your solver can output into one of the file formats that
ParaView understands. Those are listed at:
   http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Users_Guide/List_of_readers
Many, but not all of those are parallel aware and will do exactly what
you are trying to do.

2) If not, first see the VTK User's Guide chapter 16. This describes
in detail the API for VTK's data structures. Your reader is
responsible for parsing the file and filling in VTK data objects. Next
see
http://paraview.org/Wiki/Writing_ParaView_Readers, which is the same
as Chapter 21 in the ParaView guide, with the errata
(http://paraview.org/Wiki/Book_Errata) fixed. This book chapter
describes what a reader must do to read in parallel.

I don't think we have a filter which does that yet. The statistics
filters might come close but I suspect they won't do exactly what you
want.

I recommend you write a two input python programmable filter which
compares the number of points and cells on its two inputs and then if
they match iterates over them and compares their attribute values
element by element.

This example from the wiki comes pretty close to what you want to do:

The ex2 object is a reader, it won't have data in it. The ex2 object
should have a control that you can use to specify which arrays to
read/ignore from the file but that is different from what you are
asking for.
In any case when you update the reader it it will produce data, and
that you already know how to fetch and inspect.

Message-ID: <AANLkTinhFi8aVE+ApFy9rThf+n9jGMiuwQo2q_ZfwvqK@mail.gmail.com>

Folks,

For those of you who haven't follow the topic in the
paraview-developers mailing list here is a quick summary on what's
going on in the coming weeks.
We've been working for a while now on restructuring the Server Manager
of ParaView to make it more efficient as well as allowing it to
support collaborative workflows.
The API has undergone major changes and may cause some minor rewrite
of your own code. Before we merge these changes to master, please try
out the Collaboration branch with your code and let us know if you
experience any issue.
Please see below for the details on how to checkout the Collaboration branch.

Thanks for your support,

Seb

============= From the ParaView-developer list ===============

Following up the mail from Utkarsh on the changes to ParaView Server Manager :

http://public.kitware.com/pipermail/paraview-developers/2011-February/000951.html

We finally push our branch to the stage. That branch will only be
merged to master in the coming month.
But if you have developed a plugin or any code based on ParaView and
you want to test it against
that major update, please follow the coming instructions and don't
hesitate to send us your feed back.

In order to fetch our ParaView branch from stage, you will need to
execute the following command line:

$ git clone --recursive git://paraview.org/stage/ParaView.git -b Collaboration

Then, as any regular ParaView source directory, you should be able to
configure and build it.
As some directory and kit renaming occurred, you may need to update
the name of the ParaView library that you are linking against. Now the
ParaViewCore package which used to be called "Servers" contains the
following kits:
vtkPVCommon, vtkPVClientServerCore, vtkPVServerImplementation,
vtkPVServerManager, vtkPVVTKExtensions.

Please remember, these do not affect 3.10 or even 3.10.1. These will
make into the
official ParaView 4.0 release, nothing sooner.

Seb

PS: Additional informations on those changes are available here

Hello everyone,

I had problems when loading files for which there are more then one
readers available. When I looked at
Qt/ApplicationComponents/pqLoadDataReaction.cxx I noticed in
pqLoadDataReaction::DetermineFileReader() Ln 187, pqSelectReaderDialog
is shown only when there are more then 3 available readers! Shouldn't
it be shown when there are more then 1 available reader, i.e.

if(list->GetLength() > 3)

be replaced with

if(list->GetLength() > 1)?

Thanks,
Nenad.

Hi,

I think it would be helpful if there is a quick guidance about what
changes to what in typical cases, for example what I have figured out
for my plugin are (am I correct about all these?):

OLD: pxy->Set/GetServers() (where pxy is a vtkSMProxy)
NEW: pxy->Set/GetLocation()

OLD: pxy->Set/GetConnectionID()
NEW: pxy->Set/GetSession()

OLD: pxy->GetID()
NEW: VTKOBJECT(pxy) (a stream operator in client-server stream)

OLD: pm->SendSteram(this->GetConnectionID(), this->GetServers(), stream)
NEW: this->ExecuteStream(stream) (where this is a vtkSMProxy)

OLD: pm->SendStream(pxy->GetConnectionID(), pxy->GetServers(), stream)
NEW: pxy->GetSession()->ExecuteStream(pxy->GetLocation(), stream)
(where pm is a vtkProcessModule)

Also, what I noticed so far are
* CoProcessing module does not build due to some missing headers.
* ParaViewCore/ServerManager/vtkSMDataSourceProxy.{cxx,h} are orphaned
  (have no reference from other sources or CMakeLists).

Subject: [Paraview] Image Mathematics
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=vEJ1mVdi045o3+nt9WXz7PxftcOBhcuLVck30@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,
I am trying to embed the vtkImageMathematics filter in ParaView, but I
have a pipeline issue (attached are the corresponding XML
servermanagers).
For "one input" operations (add K, invert, sin, cos,...) everything
works well. But for "two inputs" operations (Add, Multiply, Min,
Max,...) the pipeline browser does not show the connections between
the input images and the ImageMathematics filter. Note that updating
the pipeline produces the right output! The only problem is that I
cannot right-click and choose "change input". Another consequence is
that a python-scripted state is not able to rebuild the pipeline.

FYI, I already developed a two-image-inputs filter (image convolution
with a kernel represented by another vtkImageData:
http://github.com/jeromevelut/vtkKinship) for which this issue doesn't
occur. Could it be the way the input informations are provided at the
VTK side of the filter ?

Thanks a lot,
Jerome

Hi David,

Thanks for the tip. I just noticed the little "Edit View Options" button 
just above a view and that also gives quick(er) access to the projection 
setting.

Regards,
Paul

Hi Takuya,

I'm glad that you gave a try and you managed to make your plugin work.
Moreover, thanks for that "cheat sheet".

Here is my feedback about it:

> OLD: pxy->Set/GetServers() (where pxy is a vtkSMProxy)
> NEW: pxy->Set/GetLocation()

Yes

> OLD: pxy->Set/GetConnectionID()
> NEW: pxy->Set/GetSession()

Yes, but those lines should simply be removed as the session is set on
the Proxy at its creation, therefore there is no point in doing it
twice.

> OLD: pxy->GetID()
> NEW: VTKOBJECT(pxy) (a stream operator in client-server stream)

Yes

> OLD: pm->SendSteram(this->GetConnectionID(), this->GetServers(), stream)
> NEW: this->ExecuteStream(stream) (where this is a vtkSMProxy)

Yes

> OLD: pm->SendStream(pxy->GetConnectionID(), pxy->GetServers(), stream)
> NEW: pxy->GetSession()->ExecuteStream(pxy->GetLocation(), stream)
> (where pm is a vtkProcessModule)

Yes, but as you did it previously you can also do that
NEW2: pxy->ExecuteStream(stream)

> Also, what I noticed so far are
> * CoProcessing module does not build due to some missing headers.

I'm going to look into that and fix it. Thanks to have notice it.

> * ParaViewCore/ServerManager/vtkSMDataSourceProxy.{cxx,h} are orphaned

Yes, I was planning to remove it. Are you using it ?

Thanks again for those valuable comments,

Seb

Seb, thanks for the clarifications, especially pointing out
that Set/GetSession() are redundant.

In fact, this is not possible because vtkSMProxy::ExecuteStream() is
protected (is this a bug or intended?).

It is intended, specially if your are not inside the vtkSMProxy class
implementation.
It is more a helper method that use the proxy session and location to
send and execute the stream that may not be related in any other way
to that proxy.

Hi Utkarsh,

 Thank you for the code. It works fine and gets me almost to where I want.
When I use the implicit plane with the cut filter, I'm pulling up an
object inspector widget for it. Is there a way I can attach the visibility
of the plane to the check box in the inspector?

Cheers,
M

The plane widget has a "setVisiblity" slot, you can connect the
checkbox to that slot.

Subject: [Paraview] "Make install" fails
Message-ID: <4D920021.5050003@sara.nl>

Hi,

With a freshly built PV 3.8.1 with CMake 2.8.4 I get (see attachement
for full log) this with "make install":

[...]
-- Installing:
/home/opti/software/pv381reldebinfo/lib/paraview-3.8/purple-2/perl
-- Installing:
/home/opti/software/pv381reldebinfo/lib/paraview-3.8/purple-2/perl/auto

-- Installing:
/home/opti/software/pv381reldebinfo/lib/paraview-3.8/paraview/paraview
CMake Error at Applications/ParaView/cmake_install.cmake:70 (FILE):
    file INSTALL cannot make directory
    "/home/opti/software/pv381reldebinfo/lib/paraview-3.8/paraview/paraview":
    Not a directory
Call Stack (most recent call first):
    Applications/cmake_install.cmake:37 (INCLUDE)
    cmake_install.cmake:49 (INCLUDE)


make: *** [install] Error 1


The reason installation fails is that
/home/opti/software/pv381reldebinfo/lib/paraview-3.8/paraview/paraview
is already present as a file (2,052,666 bytes). I've found several
installation issues on the list, but none like this. I also wonder why
all kinds of Paraview-unrelated stuff is in the output (see full log,
e.g. totem, open office, mono, vlc, xulrunner, ...). It's almost like
all installed packages on the system get somehow represented in the PV
lib/paraview-3.8 directory. Something like that might explain the clash,
as a system-wide PV 3.4.0 is also installed, from the normal Ubunty
package repo.


Perhaps relevant build options:

BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON
CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
PARAVIEW_BUILD_QT_GUI=ON
PARAVIEW_ENABLE_PYTHON=ON
PARAVIEW_USE_MPI=OFF

Other info:
Ubuntu 10.04.2 x86_64
GCC 4.4.3
CMake 2.8.4 (built from source, no system cmake installed).


Regards,
Paul

Message-ID: <alpine.DEB.2.00.1103291643260.4459@localhost>


  The reader of Ensight gold files, using sos (so to group the files for 
parallel view) doesn't work properly.

  In a related not, I'm at a lost of understanding how use use the parallel 
capabilities of paraview with ensight files.

  I'm using a structured grid. It doesn't distribute my already partitioned 
files or

  allows me to distribute them using D3.

  I have the impression there must be some regression regarding the reader? 
I have idea of being able to open .sos and it to be distributed accross 
process?!

Hi Ricardo,

It will be great if you can post all the ensight files and I will try
to replicate the problem.

Hi Folks,

I've push some new code in the same stage branch that should fix the
plugins (coprocessing, manta, EyeDomLighting...) and some other minor
bugs.

Sven also provide me some feedback that may be interesting to share:
For those with custom readers that internally use FileSeriesReader:

* Replace in servermanager XML:

    <FileSeriesReaderProxy name="..." ...>

 with

    <SourceProxy name="..." ... si_class="vtkSIFileSeriesReaderProxy">

Moreover, you can look into the git history and see what I did change
to make those plugin work.
The manta one could be interesting for some of you. (git show 2aa56d)

Enjoy,

Seb

Hi Seb,

http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Plugin_HowTo#Adding_an_object_panel shows
a trivial example of how to tweak a panel with some custom GUI elements. For
convenience, I've put the necessary code together in the attached archive.

With the Collaboration branch, this plugin's text "This is from a plugin" won't
get displayed any more in the panel of the Cone source for release builds.
A debug build of the code still compiles just fine against a Collaboration
branch debug build, even loads into it, but when creating a cone source,
ParaView crashes with

ERROR: In
/ParaViewCollaboration.git/ParaViewCore/ServerManager/vtkSMRemoteObject.cxx,
line 124
vtkSMSourceProxy (0x11a4730): GlobalID must NOT be changed once it has been
assigned.
Try to set 145 to replace the current 289 value.

Any idea what might need to be changed in order to get this working?
A different syntax for the ADD_PARAVIEW_OBJECT_PANEL in CMakeLists.txt maybe?

Thanks for any hint.

Sven

are the errors:

ERROR: In ParaView/Servers/ServerManager/vtkSMProxyManager.cxx, line 374

vtkSMProxyManager (0x1d3d400): No proxy that matches: group=mappers and
proxy=PolyDataMapper were found.

 ERROR: In ParaView/Servers/ServerManager/vtkSMProxy.cxx, line 1985

 Warning: In ParaView/Servers/ServerManager/vtkSMProxyManager.cxx, line 294

vtkSMProxyManager (0x1d3d400): Creation of new proxy
vtkSMSurfaceRepresentationProxy failed (representations,
MySpecialRepresentation).


I see that vtkSMSurfaceRepresentationProxy has been removed from 3.10.  Does
anyone know how to get this working (and then I might be able to get my own
ones working too!)?

Thanks,
Paul

Message-ID: <AANLkTinJ6qy5mjaLsjKqXRtAkjzh0Wk5dQ1GYqDx+xp3@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I perform some calculations in Paraview, through a ProgrammableFilter in
which I use several vtk.vtkArrayCalculator objects that I connect between
each other with GetOutputPort and GetInputConnection.

In the 3.8.1 release of Paraview, such a calculation on a grid with 1.5e6
points need roughly 3 or 4 seconds.
In the 3.10.0, using the same tool (an external module, writen in python,
that I import into the programmable filter), it takes 6 or 7 times longer.

Is there some explanation ?

Thanks,

Aur?lien

Hello,
i am trying to develop a small client application for the paraview 
servermanager. I have managed to create views and representations.
Now i need to generate source data on the fly (something like the 
programmablesource from pvpython). Can i do this directly from c++ 
without using the python wrapper.
Best regards,

Hi Sven,

I just give a try with the archive you provided and I get the expected
result without any crash.
On which system did you get that failure ?

Yes, that's what all the default data-sources do. Take a look at the
code for any of the other sources that matches most closely to what
you're generating as a starting point.

Hello

I do lot of paraview on my 13'' macbook. It would great if it were possible
to set small icon sizes and small font sizes. The default sizes occupy too
much space leaving for the actual display. The object inspector is too wide;
if I set it small I need to scroll a lot. This is because many of the
buttons are too wide than necessary.

Thanks

Some informations more :

In a programmable filter, I execute the same following script on both
paraview 3.8.1 and paraview 3.10.0 - binary releases for win32.
The input is a MultiBlockDataSet, 4.5e6 nodes.

   import time

   balise = time.time()

   from paraview import vtk

   i = self.GetInput()

   o = i.NewInstance()

   for numbloc in range(1, 26):

      calc = vtk.vtkArrayCalculator()

      calc.SetInput(i.GetBlock(numbloc))

      calc.AddScalarArrayName('ro',0)

      calc.SetFunction('ro^2')

      calc.Update()

      o.SetBlock(numbloc, calc.GetOutput())

   self.GetOutput().ShallowCopy(o)

   print time.time() - balise

With Paraview 3.8.1 --> 1.17 s
Whereas with Paraview 3.10.0 --> 19s ..... !!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Hi?Aur?lien,

I did confirm that it is slow now (5 times slower with a sphere having
a million points on my linux 64 system). I will see if I can fix it
soon (first need to find the reason).

Thanks for reporting this.

Thanks for the report, this is now bug 12027.
http://paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=12027

Great to know that it is mostly working on windows. Manta itself has
had spotty support for that OS. I'm glad to see the Manta developers
got it working.

Note that even once we fix the bug, Manta will still be fairly slow
when you change timesteps. It has to resort the geometry for every
change in t, and sorting is a big bottleneck.

Sorry, ParaView doesn't have true vector graphics output. Please add
your vote to the existing user voice request for it.

(http://paraview.uservoice.com/forums/11350-general/suggestions/313565-add-vector-graphics-output-i-e-postscript-?ref=title)

The pdf writer in ParaView uses Qt to write a raster image. VTK's
vtkGL2PSExporter is not exercised by ParaView at all and it is likely
not to support many of our rendering techniques if it was added as an
new exporter option. 2D views are more likely to be supported, but we
haven't yet had the time to do so.

Subject: [Paraview] paraview crashes on volume represntation in tutorial
	example
Message-ID: <4D94007B.5040503@gmail.com>

Greetings,

First of all, I have just started using paraview, and i must 
congratulate the developers for making such a powerful and easy to use 
system.

My system is a core 2 duo  2.1 Ghz , 4Gb RAM dell laptop running debian 
lenny and paraview 2.6.2.

I was learning from the paraview tutorial when i tried to change the 
representation of the object to 'volume'(the example file is 
disk_out_ref.ex2). On doing this, my processors went to 100% capacity 
and the application became non-responsive.
Can someone please tell me what is going on here? I shut it after ~5 
mins , but i don't think it should be going on for that long.

Hi again,
I found the origin of the pipeline issue: The XML description of the filter
must set the name of one input to "Input". The 2-inputs ImageMathematics
works well with first input name="Input" rather than name="Input1".
Second input name="Input2" does not have to be changed.

Should I fill a bug entry for that? Is it a design constraint?

Best regards,
Jerome

Hi,

i tried to compile the ParaView version from today (31.03) with 
VRPN-support, but it fails in CMake after switching the 
PARAVIEW_BUILD_PLUGIN_VRPNPlugin to on:


CMake Error at Plugins/VRPN/CMakeLists.txt:7 (FIND_PACKAGE):
    Could not find module FindParaView.cmake or a configuration file for
    package ParaView.

    Adjust CMAKE_MODULE_PATH to find FindParaView.cmake or set 
ParaView_DIR to
    the directory containing a CMake configuration file for ParaView.  
The file
    will have one of the following names:

      ParaViewConfig.cmake
      paraview-config.cmake




  VRPN_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/local/include

  VRPN_LIBRARY=/usr/local/lib

Compiling and use of VRPN itself was no problem ...

Any ideas?

     Stefan

Hi all,

When trying to save an animation in avi from a loaded vtk legacy file
series, i get

ERROR: In ..\..\..\..\source\VTK\IO\vtkAVIWriter.cxx, line 172
vtkAVIWriter (000000001758AD80): Unable to compress...

All i find online is that it shouldn't work in a non-windows platform.

I'm running paraview 3.10 64bit (awesome, thanks guys!) on a windows

Any thoughts?

You might try to run the script below to see if your image quality is good
enough to use vtkGL2PSExporter

rw=GetActiveView().GetRenderWindow()
exp=paraview.vtk.vtkInstantiator.CreateInstance('vtkGL2PSExporter')
exp.SetRenderWindow(rw)
exp.SetDrawBackground(0)
exp.SetSortToSimple()
exp.SetFileFormatToEPS()
exp.SetFilePrefix("test")
#exp.Write3DPropsAsRasterImageOn()
exp.Write()

Hi,

I happen to have a small patch for the git master branch that adds vector
graphics output (EPS, PS and SVG) to the Save Screenshot dialog and uses
vtkGL2PSExporter as a backend, too. Actually, it's just an updated version of
the patch for this matter I posted on this list back in 2007. But as holds for
the Python approach it has a few drawbacks:

* Only 3D View support
* Builtin mode and client/server mode support (but using merely 1 server
process, empty file when using more)
* No support for Manta/EyeDom/other views
* No multi-view support
* No support for mandelbrot source
* No support for text/annotate time source (a rectangular box is drawn instead),
one can resort to a 3D Text source, though
* No support for Volume rendering
* No support for Slice representation (try Surface representation of a slice
filter output)
* No support for PointSprite representation
* No support for SurfaceLIC representation, even crashes ParaView on export
* In display tab of object inspector, "Interpolate scalars" needs to be ticked
off for every visible object; otherwise object is rendered gray
(see http://www.vtk.org/Bug/view.php?id=1630)
* Requires an old version of the colorbar implementation or colorbar will be
rendered gray

So, don't get your hopes up too much about vtkGL2PSExporter.

I believe you are referring to the newer Exodus file reader.  The ParaView/VTK/Hybrid/vtkExodusIIReader* source files implement that.

The Exodus II reader outputs unstructured grids in a multiblock data set.  Face and edge data are handled by creating new blocks with lines for edges and polygons for faces.  It makes it straightforward to store line and edge data as cell data in these special blocks, but it is difficult to restore the topological relationships between the faces, edges, and the cells they come from.

I'm not surprised. A lot of code assumes the primary input to be named
"Input", although midway in  the ParaView development lifespan we
decided to abondon that notion, yet there may be code that assumes
that. Feel free to file a bug, but I have a feeling it will be while
before we attempt to fix this.

Sven,

Despite the limitations, would you please push that patch to github?
Once there distribution, upkeep and maintenance will be easier.

In cmake, set ParaView_DIR to the top level of your ParaView build
directory. (This must be a legacy from when the plugin was build externally
to ParaView and we'll make it go away in the near future.)

Next point VRPN_INCLUDE directory to wherever you've installed the vrpn
library's header files. Finally point VRPN_LIBRARY to wherever you've
installed the vrpn library itself.

Configure and make and the vrpn plugin should now show up in the manage
plugins dialog.

Subject: [Paraview] pqColorScaleEditor crash
Message-ID: <BAY148-w2236E023F6177E6EBC7726C3BF0@phx.gbl>


I'm making a program that make calculation and try to integrate some Paraview stuff, every things goes fine, I have my render from the server, but when I use pqColorScaleEditor, the dialog show himself, I can change color depending on scale but when I check the legend checkbox, the application crash and I have no idea why ...

Part of my code :

    void Widget3D::show_color_editor(){

      scaleEdit = new pqColorScaleEditor(m_RenderView->getWidget());
      pqDataRepresentation* repr = m_input->getRepresentation(m_RenderView);
      scaleEdit->setRepresentation(repr);
      scaleEdit->show();

    }

    void Widget3D::createView(){
        if(m_server){
        // create a graphics window and put it in our main window
        this->m_RenderView = qobject_cast<pqRenderView*>(
          m_object_builder->createView(pqRenderView::renderViewType(), m_server));

        if(m_RenderView){
          m_layout_v->insertWidget(0,this->m_RenderView->getWidget());
        }else{
            //NLog::globalLog()->addError("Problem when creating a RenderView.");
        }
        }else{
            //NLog::globalLog()->addError("Cannot create RenderView if no paraview server connection is set.");
        }

    }

    void Widget3D::showRender()
    {
        if(m_source){

            m_input = m_source;//m_filter2;

            m_object_builder->createDataRepresentation(m_input->getOutputPort(0), this->m_RenderView);

            changeStyle();

            pqDataRepresentation* repr = m_input->getRepresentation(m_RenderView);

            this->m_color->setRepresentation(m_input->getRepresentation(m_RenderView));

            //this->scaleEdit->setRepresentation(m_input->getRepresentation(m_RenderView));

            qDebug() << repr->getLookupTable();
            //m_RenderView->get
            qDebug() << repr->getLookupTableProxy();

            // zoom to object
            this->m_RenderView->resetCamera();
            // make sure we update
            this->m_RenderView->render();

        }else{
            //NLog::globalLog()->addError("There is no file to render.");
        }
    }

    Widget3D::Widget3D(QWidget *parent) :
            QWidget(parent)
    {
        // automatically make a server connection
        m_core = pqApplicationCore::instance();
        m_object_builder = m_core->getObjectBuilder();

        // Register ParaView interfaces.
        m_plugin_manager = m_core->getPluginManager();

        // adds support for standard paraview views.
        m_plugin_manager->addInterface(new pqStandardViewModules(m_plugin_manager));

    createView();

        showRender();

        connect(m_show_color_palet,SIGNAL(released()),this,SLOT(show_color_editor()));

    }



You'll notice that I use client - server paraview architecture. What is strange is that I have no problem seting color on my mesh but the legend make the application crash. 

I tryed different things like :
      scaleEdit = new pqColorScaleEditor(m_RenderView->getWidget());

      scaleEdit->show();
     => it show me that there is no map ta set the legend... So I think it found the map

Maybe the problem is that the rendering is made in server side, but I did not have problems with "pqDisplayColorWidget" that also use pqDataRepresentation.


Thanks for any idea, if you need the full code I can provide it.

Thanks Utkarsh!
Well, I am ok with calling an input "Input" ;).

Subject: [Paraview] How to get the different data array / data set of a

The solution was to use "pqDisplayColorWidget" ... 

I'd use it like follow and it worked well : 

this->m_RenderView = qobject_cast<pqRenderView*>(
          m_object_builder->createView(pqRenderView::renderViewType(), m_server));

           QPointer<pqPipelineSource> m_source = m_object_builder->createReader("sources", "LegacyVTKFileReader",QStringList(given_file), m_server);

            pqDataRepresentation* repr = m_input->getRepresentation(m_RenderView);

            this->m_color->setRepresentation(m_input->getRepresentation(m_RenderView));


Hope it'll help someone.

Subject: [Paraview] How to get the different data array / data set of a vtk	file








In Paraview, in "Information" > "Data Arrays" there is a list of the data set of my vtk file (name,type,Data range).

But when I create a 'LegacyVTKFileReader', I give the inputFile, but how do I know number of dataSet , their names and how do I use one specifically ? ( Actually I automaticaly use the first dataSet )

Thanks in advance ! :-)

Gil,

If you can provide the call-stack for where you're getting the
segfault, it will be helpful.

Subject: [Paraview] Legacy VTK files - format issues
References: <mailman.6971.1301582877.4186.paraview@paraview.org>
Message-ID: <28466993-191F-4E02-8C71-EF34699866CF@andrew.cmu.edu>

For anyone who has had problems with reading legacy VTK files, esp. in v 3.10, be careful to avoid leading spaces, and to use UPPERCASE.
For example, this works:
# vtk DataFile Version 2.0
written by FFT4-FFTW-mpi 
ASCII
DATASET STRUCTURED_POINTS
DIMENSIONS         512          64          64
ORIGIN 0.0 0.0 0.0
SPACING    1.10462212541120       0.475555065232886       0.475555065232886     
POINT_DATA     2097152
SCALARS stress float
LOOKUP_TABLE default
etc.

This, e.g., does not work (file reads in but nothing displays)!
# vtk datafile Version 2.0
written by FFT4-FFTW-mpi 
ASCII
 DATASET STRUCTURED_POINTS
DIMENSIONS         512          64          64
 ORIGIN 0.0 0.0 0.0
 spacing    1.10462212541120       0.475555065232886       0.475555065232886     
POINT_DATA     2097152
SCALARS stress float
LOOKUP_TABLE default
