Attached is an extract from the ParaView User's Guide under
development that pretty much covers this.

Subject: [Paraview] CUDA dependency issue when building ParaView 4.1.0-RC2
	on Mac
Message-ID: <CANcsQPdoDtCvqB7ji-dOYHHfY1=pg=78ypVSt=jFM+r=7uqUvA@mail.gmail.com>

I'm trying to build ParaView 4.1.0-RC2 from source on Mac OS (10.8.5).
 This machine does not have CUDA installed (and has no nvidia graphics
hardware).

When running ccmake, I get this error:

CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR not found or specified

This seems to be coming from the call:
find_package(CUDA)
in
Plugins/SciberQuestToolKit/SciberQuest/CMakeLists.txt

If I comment that line out, I can successfully compile.  I'm no cmake guru,
but it seems like if I don't have CUDA installed, find_package(CUDA) should
just set CUDA_FOUND to OFF and not require any paths to CUDA to be set.
 Maybe this is an issue with the CUDA module in CMake rather than ParaView.
 I'm using the latest CMake (2.8.12.1).

Thanks,
Ben

Hi Benjamin,

This is of interest to me as I haven't been involved in the recent 
plugin changes and need to look through them more closely.

You reported an informational message that is not an error. Could you 
report the actual error?

btw, I also see the message on my ATI based system, but it doesn't 
prevent me from building. For example in ccmake I can press "e" to exit 
the informational screen where the message is displayed and then hit "g" 
to generate the make files and go on to compile without issue.

Dear Ben and Burlen,

On my Mac Book Pro with NVidia card, I received the same informational
message but it builds if I exit the informational screen with 'e' and hit
'g'.

Best regards,
Patrick

You're right.  I didn't realize this was just an informational message, and
not an error that has to be resolved.  After I hit that message the first
time, then configure a second time and hit that message again, I can
successfully generate the makefile.

Thanks,
Ben

Hey Patrick and Ben, Thanks for the feedback.

In this case I think it's confusing to be dumped into a separate ccmake 
screen. I'd say it's really an issue in the FindCUDA.cmake module, which 
does

  message("CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR not found or specified")

according to the documentation a naked message command is supposed to 
mean "Important information". In this case it's not. I think this 
message should probably be downgraded to STATUS type. just my 2 cents.

At any rate, we could avoid the problem in PV if in the plugin we used

find_package(CUDA QUIET)

but initially all the cuda stuff, including find_package, was controlled 
by a cache variable so that this confusing behavior could be avoided and 
I wouldn't have to use the QUIET option because when you're actually 
trying to configure for cuda the output is helpful if things go wrong.

Subject: [Paraview] XDMF specify geometry with external ascii file
Message-ID: <4181B828-7355-4309-B8C0-83BFFBD415D5@sdsc.edu>

Hi,

I am writing a header XDMF file for uni-grid scalar binary data, which works fine, but when I try to include geometry coordinates using a ASCII file, paraview crashes complaining.
"Required geometry type is ORIGIN_DX_DY or ORIGIN_DX_DY_DZ. The specified geometry type is : XYZ"

Searching the mail list it seems possible to include geometry info with external hdf files, is it possible to include an external ascii file "geo.xyz"?
The geo.xyz file is space separated one tuple per line  of  X Y Z in floating point format, like many examples show for inline xmf file
Could you provide any tips to overcome this problem. 

Here is the XDMF header file. Thanks

Never mind I could use ORIGIN_DXDYDZ with origin and delta for each axis to accomplish this rather than passing an external file.

Aur?lien,

Thanks for your feedback.

I just tried showing a matplotlib window using show() from within a
programmable filter in the ParaView nighly binary on linux and it does
not appear to work. It may be because the version of matplotlib that
is shipped with the ParaView binaries does not have the proper backend
enabled to show matplotlib windows.

On my development build that uses matplotlib installed with apt-get on
Ubuntu, I can indeed use show() from within a programmable filter to
pop up a simple matplotlib window.

I hope that helps,
Cory

Dear Kalin,

It would be appropriate to send this question to paraview mailing list
(cc'd). Also, please specify details on your system so that we can provide
you a better answer on it.

Thank you Aashish,

The system that I am trying to build on is a Windows Server 2008. I am building on a network share (I also installed Qt on the same drive). I just installed CUDA as well in order to see if that would help, but it seems that I still get this error:

> CMake Error at VTK/CMake/vtkDetermineCompilerFlags.cmake:125 (SET):

Let me know if you need any other details.

I have tried both the regular build and the "super build" and it seems I am running into the same issue. I am getting errors both in CMake (the entire output of the latest session is attached below) and when running the make process from VS2010. The errors are similar to the following:

Kalin,

The "CUDA" message is just a message and not an error. We'll have that
cleaned soon enough. At the same time, the vtkDetermineCompilerFlags
error is indeed a real problem. Let's try to track that down.

What cmake version are  you using and what was the generator used?

Looking at the code in vtkDetermineCompilerFlags.cmake, I can see that
the error may show up when NUMBER_OF_PROCESSORS environment variable
is not set. Rob, can you take a look, please? Is that variable
expected to be set by VS?

Burlen,

CUDA is confusing more people than not. Also it's adding too many
variables. A cleanup to FindCUDA.cmake is certainly in the order.
Until then, I propose we swicth SQTK_CUDA variable to do a
find_package(CUDA) only if SQTK_CUDA is enabled. What do you think?
BTW, I want to tag the release soon, so we should try to keep changes
to a minimal at this point.

that's how it was handled it in the past, prior the recent refactoring, 
and I think that's the way to go. Where does the refactoring stand is 
Ben B finished? It would be great if Ben B could clean this up, but if 
not I can make a pass next week.

Subject: [Paraview] PV3.14 How to create three equal size windows
Message-ID: <52C7D615.7040900@inria.fr>

I start with a single PV window. Using the icon I can split the window 
into two equally sized windows.
When I split one of the two equally sized windows I get three windows 
BUT the sizes are different.

What is the simplest approach to get three equally sized windows?
Hope my question is clear.

start with one split, and split both, but don't create a view in the 
last one. you should have 3 equal size views. Saving screenshots only 
captures the 3 panels that have views.

There are three equal sized views but 4 windows. If I add a title using 
source in the middle window, the width of the title  is limited. Is 
there an easy to delete the 4th window and have the three views spread 
over the full width of the visualization area. That way I could put a 
longer title.
Hope my question is clear.

Another way is use Python e.g. (assuming there just 1 one), launch
Tools | Python shell and do the following:

> view1 = GetActiveView()
> layout = GetLayout()
> layout.SplitViewHorizontal(view1, 0.3333)

That will split the view into two part ~1/3 and ~2/3. Now you can
split the view-pane on the right side using the UI buttons directly
which will give your 3 views of the same size (more or less).

Depending on what you are trying to visualize, you could try using the
comparative view. You can easily set up a grid of equal-sized windows
(such as 3x1). However, the visualizations you put in these windows is
limited in that they have to have the same data but have different
properties (such as different time steps).


Using the comparative view is described in detail on this Wiki page:

Subject: [Paraview] segfault with append data for polyhedron datasets
Message-ID: <CABWOrb8+UESOg=V6aKXOPs09EfdvOnynUtk2tyQiudhUzuxVVQ@mail.gmail.com>

I'm having problems when using data with polyhedron cells.  I get a
segfault when I run append data on the attached datasets.  I've got a very
simple example - two datasets, one with 3 cells and other with 2 cells.
 The steps to reproduce:

Load polyhedron1.vtu
Load polyhedron2.vtu
Select both, choose "Append datasets" and apply

There seems to be some memory corruption somewhere but it's not obvious to
me...  Any hints would be appeciated if anyone has the time to look.

Thanks,
Paul

Hi Paul,

thanks for providing the fix. Do you mind pushing that patch to gerrit and
adding Utkarsh and I as a reviewer?

Subject: [Paraview] exagerating the axis in length not the value
Message-ID: <CA+ze5C78iac90HB-9mZQwOBCxD5gyAJ_ewempkEPWDBY1bYdpw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am opening a h5 file with ParaView using pflotranReader.

I have the following order.

1. My Dataset
2. Threshold


my dataset in X direction is in order of meters, while in y direction is in
order of milimeter.

I have scaled my data ( The threshold filter not the dataset itself ) in Y
direction by 1000. When I tick the show axis, my axis in y direction is not
is not showing as I want.

How can I have my axis showing with the correct range [0, 0.01] and
exagerated in length so that it would show properly in the image ?

Thanks

Message-ID: <0EB9B6375711A04B820E6B6F5CCA9F681A876A8E@MBX21.d.ethz.ch>

I am using the RC2, but am puzzled by the following:

I can run paraview and create a sphere, and in the python shell, I do  this (without any problem)

s = FindSource('Sphere1')
dp = GetDisplayProperties(s)
dp.OpacityTableValues

I use "save state" and the python code sets OpacityTableValues

if instead I run pvpython, I cannot access the OpacityTableValues attr.

from paraview.simple import *
s = Sphere()
dp = Show(s)
dp.OpacityTableValues
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "/apps/eiger/src/ParaView-v4.1.0Build/lib/site-packages/paraview/servermanager.py", line 414, in __getattr__
    return getattr(self.SMProxy, name)

sorry if this is trivial...

I think OpacityTableValues is coming from the "PointSprite" plugin
that's loaded in your ParaView. The Python trace/state doesn't capture
the loaded plugins. You should either manually load the plugin
(http://www.paraview.org/ParaView3/Doc/Nightly/www/py-doc/paraview.simple.html#paraview.simple.LoadPlugin)
 before in the python script or save the state file from a ParaView
without the plugin loaded.

Any updates? We should clean this up before the release.

Hello,

I am trying to configure paraview 4.1. I get the following cmake error:

CMake Error: The following variables are used in this project, but they are
set to NOTFOUND.
Please set them or make sure they are set and tested correctly in the CMake
files:
MPI_HEADER_PATH
    used as include directory in directory
/u/staff/semeraro/Paraview/ParaView-v4.1.0-RC2/Plugins/SciberQuestToolKit/Para
ViewPlugin

There is no MPI_HEADER_PATH in the list of variables when I use ccmake. How do I set MPI_HEADER_PATH in that case?

Regards,
Dave Semeraro

Utkarsh

you are right about OpacityTableValues coming from the "PointSprite" plugin. What really caught me is the fact that my script only works if I load the PointSprite plugin last.

I used to have the following lines (which create the error)

LoadPlugin("/local/apps/ParaView-v4.1.0Build/lib/libH5PartReader.so", ns=globals())
LoadPlugin("/local/apps/ParaView-v4.1.0Build/lib/libPointSprite_Plugin.so", ns=globals())

I then reverted the order of loads to this,

LoadPlugin("/local/apps/ParaView-v4.1.0Build/lib/libH5PartReader.so", ns=globals())
LoadPlugin("/local/apps/ParaView-v4.1.0Build/lib/libPointSprite_Plugin.so", ns=globals())

and it works fine. I am perhaps missing a subtlety of LoadPlugin()

That is weird. I don't see any reference to MPI_HEADER_PATH in the ParaView
source. What version of CMake are you using? Mind attaching your
CMakeCache.txt from the build directory?

Thanks

hello

I need help to compute eigenvalues in paraview. In particular, I am interested in plotting the isosurface of the second eigenvalue of S^2+Omega^2 where S and Omega are the symmetric and antisymetric parts of the velocity gradient tensor.



Thank you

You should be to compute derived quantities using a Python calculator (or

Sorry for the hiatus. To hastily feed on Seb's curiosity, yes indeed the
behavior is blind to data source type. As for Aashish's concern, it is a
misunderstanding. I did mention I ran the client on VM, not the pvserver.
Thus discounting hardware as the root cause. Actually I just realized that
the 26 FPS was from the standalone ParaView (i.e. not connected to pvserver
as can be seen in the pipeline browser). Upon connecting to a local
pvserver, the FPS plummeted quite dramatically. Adjusting it to 'shared
memory/localhost' does the trick (more info here:
http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Image_Compressor_Configuration). The
obvious question would be, how can we do that in ParaViewWeb?

 

A second rather counter-intuitive question, why couldn't we see a degraded
image in ParaViewWeb when interacting with a polygonal object, it only
appears so in the VTK render window (first image is without interaction,
second is with interaction)? This observation does not reflected in ParaView
(i.e. you'll see the lost in quality during interaction). Ultimately how
much of this behavior (if any) impact the overall performance?

 

Regards,

Den

If you are using VM or offscreen rendering, then it is likely that you are
not using hardware acceleration (depending on your setup, VM tool, and
hardware). A simple check using glxgears could give your more info.

Hi Den,

 

out of curiosity, does basic surface rendering with sample VTK dataset work
as slow? In other word, is it just the volume rendering that does not behave

I'm surprised to see a so huge difference in term of performance.

Hi,

 

How can I improve the surface rendering performance of ParaViewWeb (besides
tweaking the still/interactive-image quality settings)? I could get a decent
FPS (26+/-) on ParaView (as depicted below) and ~50% decrease is naturally
expected when ported to ParaViewWeb (based on volume rendering of some
voxels). Unfortunately, the performance drop is much more critical than
initially presumed as I could barely scoop out 1 FPS. Do note that both
client and server are executed locally (i.e. if I launched the client
through a VM or remotely, then the low FPS will be further aggravated). The
dataset specifications are included at the bottom.

Subject: [Paraview] Discovery of a 'nice' bug in volume rendering
Message-ID: <003f01cf0d17$bf97a8b0$3ec6fa10$@infovalley.net.my>

Hi,

 

In the midst of figuring out having synchronize viewports in ParaViewWeb, I
accidentally bumped into a 'bug'. This bug actually cropped up from ParaView
(see image sequence at the bottom page). First and second exhibits show a
before and after rotation around X-axis. How did I arrive to this? Load two
objects, volume rendered the first, surface rendered the other. Then I link
up the second view/camera to the first one. Aligning the objects together
via translation. Apply a transfer function, save the state and exit. Upon
reloading the state, interacting with either object will cause a
'clipping-effect' to the first object when it enters a certain planar
coordinate, which is neat primarily because now I can perform ROI on
volumetric data (at oblique angle) without incurring the wrath of
data-explosion from the clipping filter! The catch is, this effect will
subside the moment I commit any change to the transfer function or even
snapshot (hence why I did screen capture instead). Could anyone shed a light
on this some-what welcoming glitch? This 

 

Regards,

Den

Hi Den,

thanks for your interesting feedback.

Regarding your first point, I don't know how to tune the delivery option
for pvserver from the python side, but looking at the C++ code should not
be too difficult to figure out what need to be done.

For the second point, you are right, it seems that ParaViewWeb induce a
double render call, one in interactive mode and another one for the image
sent to the client as a full resolution render. And it is likely that it
affect the performances.

If those points are critical for you, we can certainly help via a support
contract to integrate some fix faster into the current code base.

Thanks again for your feedback,

Seb

Message-ID: <CALBJ7L+52gys+a4zs=7OsgNK4e12YFUBy=4OGgA9A05HiNU6bA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I am working on centrifugal compressors (like turbochargers), using
unstructured mesh.

Is there a simple way to extract the wall surface ? And also the blade
surface ?
I would like to find something like "Extract Surface" -> "Pick surface to
keep".

I have read that we can do some part of the work by combining "Extract
Surface" with "Clip". But in case of very three-dimensional geometry, this
is not possible.

Thank you for any help.

A. Marsan

Maybe the Connectivity filter is what you're looking for. After you do your
extract surface this filter should mark the connected cells.

Subject: [Paraview] Strange behavior of cube axes
Message-ID: <52D07A51.3000604@gmail.com>

Dear users and developers,

When I click on "Show cube axes", the axes are appeared but without 
labels (as shown on figure 1 ("axes_not_visible.jpg") attached to this 
message). When I start to move a model, some part of the labels becomes 
visible (as shown on figure 2 ("axes_partly_visible.jpg")). There are 
some axes positions when all labels are visible (figure 3 
"axes_visible.jpg"). It seems that there is an area around the model 
where axes labels should be to be visible. Downscaling the model makes 
the situation worse (figure 4 "axes_scaling.jpg"). Upscaling - better. 
Is it a bug, or I do something wrong?

ParaView 3.14.1 64-bit
OS Linux Mint 13

Thanks in advance.

Best regards,
Mikhail

Message-ID: <CEF5C958.2CDF8%ndfabia@sandia.gov>

Hi,

I've been trying to figure this one out for a few days and I'm finally
giving in for help.

I've got a code base on my server that should be a duplicate of the one on
my desktop, built differently.  In one case I did pulls from master at the
same time.  I've more recently just tried pulling directly from my desktop
and building clean on both.  I've also tried disabling MPI on the desktop
side and connecting without MPI on the server side.

Still I'm getting the following message when trying to reverse connect:


ERROR: In 
/projects/coprocessing/ParaView/ParaViewCore/ClientServerCore/Core/vtkTCPNe
tworkAccessManager.cxx, line 330
vtkTCPNetworkAccessManager (0x135a3150): Failed to connect to
xyz.sandia.gov:11111. Client-Server Handshake failed. Please verify that
the client and server versions are compatible with each other, and that
'connect-id', if any, matches.


And then each attempt to connect gives this on the desktop:



Accepting connection(s): xyz.sandia.gov:11111


Evidence that some sort of communication has worked.  This has worked with
master builds in the past.  I'm not sure what I changed, but there's
plenty I have that may have influenced this.

Any suggestions on where to start looking?

Thanks,
Nathan.

Delete your configuration files.  Corrupt configuration files sometimes cause this.  Surprisingly, on one client of mine, the first connect works, the configuration file gets written, and you never get another successful connect using that configuration file.

I haven't chased this down yes, hoping it goes away with the new version.  But...

If this is the problem, please let me know.  You may have an easier setup that we can use to get to the root cause of the problem.

vtkTCPNetworkAccessManager (0x135a3150): Failed to connect to xyz.sandia.gov:11111. Client-Server Handshake failed. Please verify that the client and server versions are compatible with each other, and that 'connect-id', if any, matches.


And then each attempt to connect gives this on the desktop:



Accepting connection(s): xyz.sandia.gov:11111


Evidence that some sort of communication has worked.  This has worked with
master builds in the past.  I'm not sure what I changed, but there's
plenty I have that may have influenced this.

Any suggestions on where to start looking?

Thanks,
Nathan.

That sounded promising, but it doesn't appear to have worked.  I deleted

Then no, that isn't the issue.

One more thing to try - and I don't completely know how to do it.  (i.e., ask Kitware).  I believe that they now look at not just ParaView version numbers, but also git checkin "tags" or whatever it is called.  If the two trees are basically the same, and ANYONE touched the tree between pulls, that is your problem.  This has been an issue for me when one of the two (client or server) is behind a firewall, but the other can connect back to Kitware and find that git tag.  Make sure the source trees are exactly the same.

Nathan,

First, let me clarify what is "checked", since what Alan said isn't
entirely correct.

What comprises the handshake?
========================

The handshake is a string of the following form:
     paraview.<MajorNumber>.<MinorNumber>
If a connect-id is specified then the handshake becomes:
     paraview.<MajorNumber>.<MinorNumber>.connect_id.<ConnectId>

The client and the root-server node exchange these strings. If either side
concludes that they don't match, the connection is terminated.
To debug, you can put a "cout" in
vtkTCPNetworkAccessManager::ConnectToRemove(), or
vtkTCPNetworkAccessManager::ParaViewHandshake() call on both(or either)
sides to print the relevant string.

How is the MajorNumber/MinorNumber determined?
=====================================

First, it's hardcoded in the top level CMakeLists.txt. Any time a version
number changes, this is manually updated. So on "git/master", this will
change when we changed from 4.0.1 to 4.1.0-RC1. Thus, even before the
official release the version number has changed. This could explain why two
builds from "git master" may not always work with each other.

Secondly, if the source repository is a git repository (nothing to do with
whether it has access to the Internet), then the version is determined by
using the git command "git describe". By making sure we "tag" the
repository when the CMakeLists.txt change happens, we ensure that "git
describe" results in version numbers of the form
"<MajorNumber>.<MinorNumber>-<FOO>-<BAR>". We can ignore FOO/BAR for now.
These are extra annotations that us determine exactly what  source version
you're using, esp when doing git/master builds.

The thing to note is that the handshake only uses the <MajorNumber> and
<MinorNumber>. So even if your git/master checkouts are from slightly
different points in history, they can work together (unless of course, the
two checkout happened to be across a version number change).

Hope that clarifies things. Putting a cout in vtkTCPNetworkAccessManager
and comparing the handshake strings would be a good start to debug this.

Dave - did you start with a clean build directory?   Cmake changed between
4.0 and 4.1 and any cmake cache files laying around confuse things ....

That is weird. I don't see any reference to MPI_HEADER_PATH in the ParaView
source. What version of CMake are you using? Mind attaching your
CMakeCache.txt from the build directory?

Subject: [Paraview] ANN: ParaView 4.1.0 is available for download
Message-ID: <CADHSJjA8ZzxxOAZCs3DyDWKAJG=WGAgymkpCDemecbdZQeNEOA@mail.gmail.com>

Folks,


ParaView 4.1.0 is now available for download (
http://paraview.org/paraview/resources/software.php). With over 170 issues
resolved, this release includes several bug fixes and feature enhancements.
For a detailed list of issues resolved, refer to the change log (
http://paraview.org/Bug/changelog_page.php).  Some of the notable
enhancements in this release are as follows:

*Redesigned Color Map Editor panel*

This release introduces a completely designed panel for editing color and
opacity transfer functions for scalar coloring. The panel, which is now a
dockable widget, instead of a popup dialog, makes it easier to edit
transfer functions as well as edit labels and annotations on the color
legend or scalar bar. This also makes it easier to access some of the
functionality introduced in the previous version of ParaView, such as
categorical colors. It is now easier to edit transfer functions when using
log scaling as the transfer function editor view now switches to log space.



*Enhancements to Find Data dialog*

Find Data dialog, introduced several versions ago, has quickly become of
the main mechanisms for creating new selections. However, until now, if the
user created selection using some other mechanism, such as selecting cells
in the 3D view, the Find Data dialog could not be used to inspect that
selection. One had to use what was called the Selection Inspector. That has
now been changed. Find Data dialog has been updated to always show the
active selection, no matter how it was created.

Selection Inspector panel has been removed. Selection Inspector was
primarily used to control how selections are labelled, their font
properties, etc. One can affect these directly from the Find Data dialog or
the new Selection Display Inspector which is dockable panel specially
designed for picking selection labels, label properties, or showing the
selection frustum for frustum based selections.



*Enhancements for interactions with Plots*

Inspired by plots in matplotlib, individual axes in line and bar charts can
 now be zoomed by right-clicking and dragging along the x- or y- axis. Of
course, one can still drag diagonally to scale both axes as before. Also
the the user interactions for making new selections in line chart view have
been cleaned up to be more consistent with the render view.

*Support for Python-based views*

This release adds mechanisms to enable Python developers to integrate views
that use libraries such as matplotlib for rendering. This will make it
possible to take ParaView?s charting capabilities even further. More
details on how to create such views can be found on Kitware blog (
http://www.kitware.com/blog/home/post/588).

*ParaView Catalyst: Zero-Copy infrastructure for transferring data*

A set of experimental interfaces have been added for reusing simulation
memory in portions of a Catalyst pipeline. A vtkMappedDataArray subclass
may be used for attribute/coordinate arrays, and vtkMappedUnstructuredGrid
is used for dataset topologies. More information can be found at
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/CoProcessing#Experimental:_Reusing_simulation_memory
.

*ParaView Catalyst: Editions*

Several new editions of ParaView Catalyst are now available for download
and are routinely built and tested. These editions are:

Base

minimal set of dependencies needed for Catalyst

Base-Python

Base with Python support

Essentials

Base + dependencies needed for Calculator, Contour, Clip, Cut and Glyph
filters.

Essentials-Python

Essentials with Python support

Extras

Essentials + dependencies needed for ExtractHistogram, WarpScalar,
WarpVector, IntegrateAttributes, Extract Surface filters.

Extras-Python

Extras with Python support

*SurfaceLIC and support for Parallel Rendering*

One of the notable community contributions for this release includes
extensions to the ParaView Line Integral Convolution contributed by
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL). Details can be found on the
Wiki (http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Line_Integral_Convolution). The
implementation has been designed to work with composite data in parallel
and includes a number of customizations that facilitate interactive data
exploration.

plasma.

*Updates to ParaViewWeb*

ParaViewWeb was integrated into ParaView binaries in the previous release.
This release includes several fixes and enhancements to simplify use and
deployment as well as updates to the WebGL rendering support. This
implementation supports modern browsers with WebSocket capabilities
including Safari 6+, Chrome 14+, Firefox 11+ and IE 10+.

As always, we look forward to your feedback (http://paraview.uservoice.com).

Also stay tuned to the Kitware Blog (http://www.kitware.com/blog/) for
more details
on Catalyst and ParaViewWeb.

Den,

Do you think you share the data + state file? That'll make it a little
easier to track the problem down.

Sunil,

Can you try with the latest 4.1.0 binary? There were a few glitches in the
Python/Animation API in the previous release that were ironed out in this
new one.

Thanks for the tip.  I'll try this out and let you know how it goes.

Subject: Re: [Paraview] [EXTERNAL] Client/Server connection problems

Nathan,

First, let me clarify what is "checked", since what Alan said isn't entirely correct.

What comprises the handshake?
========================

The handshake is a string of the following form:
     paraview.<MajorNumber>.<MinorNumber>
If a connect-id is specified then the handshake becomes:
     paraview.<MajorNumber>.<MinorNumber>.connect_id.<ConnectId>

The client and the root-server node exchange these strings. If either side concludes that they don't match, the connection is terminated.
To debug, you can put a "cout" in vtkTCPNetworkAccessManager::ConnectToRemove(), or vtkTCPNetworkAccessManager::ParaViewHandshake() call on both(or either) sides to print the relevant string.

How is the MajorNumber/MinorNumber determined?
=====================================

First, it's hardcoded in the top level CMakeLists.txt. Any time a version number changes, this is manually updated. So on "git/master", this will change when we changed from 4.0.1 to 4.1.0-RC1. Thus, even before the official release the version number has changed. This could explain why two builds from "git master" may not always work with each other.

Secondly, if the source repository is a git repository (nothing to do with whether it has access to the Internet), then the version is determined by using the git command "git describe". By making sure we "tag" the repository when the CMakeLists.txt change happens, we ensure that "git describe" results in version numbers of the form "<MajorNumber>.<MinorNumber>-<FOO>-<BAR>". We can ignore FOO/BAR for now. These are extra annotations that us determine exactly what  source version you're using, esp when doing git/master builds.

The thing to note is that the handshake only uses the <MajorNumber> and <MinorNumber>. So even if your git/master checkouts are from slightly different points in history, they can work together (unless of course, the two checkout happened to be across a version number change).

Hope that clarifies things. Putting a cout in vtkTCPNetworkAccessManager and comparing the handshake strings would be a good start to debug this.

Utkarsh

Then no, that isn't the issue.

One more thing to try - and I don't completely know how to do it.  (i.e., ask Kitware).  I believe that they now look at not just ParaView version numbers, but also git checkin "tags" or whatever it is called.  If the two trees are basically the same, and ANYONE touched the tree between pulls, that is your problem.  This has been an issue for me when one of the two (client or server) is behind a firewall, but the other can connect back to Kitware and find that git tag.  Make sure the source trees are exactly the same.

That sounded promising, but it doesn't appear to have worked.  I deleted everything under .config/ParaView and .config/Kitware on both machines, still getting the same error.

Message-ID: <52D4EE72.1040707@iws.uni-stuttgart.de>

Dear ParaView crew,
congratulations on your 4.1 release, I am looking forward to give it and
its new features a try.

Sadly, once more I am missing the long awaited (5 years [1]), highly
demanded (203 votes on uservoice [2]), but still back locked [3] reload
button.
Can you give an official statement whether this is planned for the near
future? Is there a technical or other reason that makes this button so
difficult to implement? How about a fund raising campaign to get some
money for its development? I am sure there are plenty of bugged users
willing to sponsor the reload button.

Love your work,
Christoph

 I am new to ParaView, and so far I was able to use it without much 
trouble. 
But I have hit a dead end, I have looked online for example, but 
unfortunately it did not help me.
I have managed to create XMF file that gives me a 3d plot, but I can't 
figure out how to couple the time data with the coordinates. 

MY GOAL IS TO BE ABLE TO PLOT THE DATA CHRONOLOGICALLY

the HDF5 file has 3 datasets for X Y Z, 1 for amplitude, and 1 for time. 
All are of the same hierarchy. 

Use the following code: 
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<!DOCTYPE Xdmf SYSTEM "Xdmf.dtd" []>
<Xdmf Version="2.0">
 <Domain>
 
        <Grid Name="mesh3" GridType="Uniform" >
                     <Topology TopologyType="Polyvertex" Dimensions="4 "/>
                     <Geometry GeometryType="X_Y_Z">

                       <DataItem Dimensions="1 1 4" NumberType="Float" 
Precision="4" Format="HDF">
                        test3.h5:/X
                       </DataItem>

                       <DataItem Dimensions="1 1 4" NumberType="Float" 
Precision="4" Format="HDF">
                       test3.h5:/Y
                       </DataItem>

                     <DataItem Dimensions="1 1 4" NumberType="Float" 
Precision="4" Format="HDF">
                               test3.h5:/Z
                       </DataItem>
                     </Geometry>

                     <Attribute Name="Pressure" AttributeType="Scalar" 
Center="Node">
                       <DataItem Dimensions="1 1 4" NumberType="Float" 
Precision="4" Format="HDF">
                        test3.h5:/MVSPCIe/Pressure
                       </DataItem>
                     </Attribute>
                <Time TimeType="List">
                 <DataItem Dimensions="4" NumberType="Float" Precision="4" 
Format="XML">
                         test3.h5:/time
                </DataItem>
                  </Time> 

         </Grid>
 </Domain>
</Xdmf>

Where and how should I put my time data in this schema for Paraview to be 
able to see it?
Does anybody have an idea? Please help...


Have a nice day, 
Ramiz


Does anybody have an idea

Hi, 

I am a new user of Paraview. I am facing a problem I cannot solve and I
have not found any relevant practice on the internet (guide user,
mailing, ...)... I want to visualise my mesh with normals specified IN
MY VTK FILE (and NOT the Normals Glyphs calculated by the software) (I
have these normals calculations in another code and I do not want to
change that). 

I am importing a mesh in Paraview from a VTK file. The VTK file contains
the following elements: 

# vtk DataFile Version 2.0
hydrodynamic vtk mesh for paraview vizu
ASCII
DATASET POLYDATA
POINTS 458 float
x0 y0 z0 (points coordinates) 

... ... ... 

....... 

POLYGONS 465 2325 

4 n1 n2 n3 n4 (points IDs) 

4 ... ... ... ... 

...... 

CELL_DATA 465 

NORMALS cell_normals float 

... ... ... (normals coordinates) 

A 'cell_normals' array appears in 'Information'; I am able to color the
surface (each cell) of the mesh according to the values of the
cell_normals array (Magnitude, X, Y or Z) but nothing more. This gives
me information on the normals orientation but I have no visual on the
vectors. 

How is it possible de visualise these normals (displayed as vectors) on
Paraview without calculating them with the software? What is the correct
pratice ? I need to know if they are well oriented, I also need some
visual on the mesh I am studying. 

Thanks a lot, 

Best regards.

Vincent

There was a talk about that feature in the mailing list with a work around
here:

http://paraview.markmail.org/thread/riu2by4yof2m4e5s#query:+page:1+mid:7dg2jctve32oijwe+state:results

But some reader do have some optimized internal caching which will prevent
this trick to work. But maybe, for the reader that you are interested in,
that might be good enough...

I'm seeing some weirdness with the color map editor.   If I choose the color
map editor option, a separate window pops up as expected.  But when I move
my cursor from the main window over to the color map pop-up window, the
color map window disappears.  If I move my cursor back to the main window,
the color map pop-up reappears.   If I drag the main GUI window over to so
that the edges of the main GUI window and the color map popup window are
touching, then the color map editor window does not disappear.   

I'm using the Linux_64 prebuilt binary on a RHEL5 Linux system running KDE
3.5.4.

Subject: [Paraview] ANN: ParaView 4.1.0 is available for download

Folks,




ParaView 4.1.0 is now available for download
(http://paraview.org/paraview/resources/software.php
<http://paraview.org/paraview/resources/software.php> ). With over 170
issues resolved, this release includes several bug fixes and feature
enhancements. For a detailed list of issues resolved, refer to the change
log (http://paraview.org/Bug/changelog_page.php
<http://paraview.org/Bug/changelog_page.php> ).  Some of the notable
enhancements in this release are as follows:


Redesigned Color Map Editor panel

This release introduces a completely designed panel for editing color and
opacity transfer functions for scalar coloring. The panel, which is now a
dockable widget, instead of a popup dialog, makes it easier to edit transfer
functions as well as edit labels and annotations on the color legend or
scalar bar. This also makes it easier to access some of the functionality
introduced in the previous version of ParaView, such as categorical colors.
It is now easier to edit transfer functions when using log scaling as the
transfer function editor view now switches to log space.

GP_0mPIpDvs4tutNRCD-dh22l_aCXV7FjCobEi0DsnSIMvifFMZqr3vYrw0HZPxOJIIwbh963WvR
p_acg> 





Enhancements to Find Data dialog

Find Data dialog, introduced several versions ago, has quickly become of the
main mechanisms for creating new selections. However, until now, if the user
created selection using some other mechanism, such as selecting cells in the
3D view, the Find Data dialog could not be used to inspect that selection.
One had to use what was called the Selection Inspector. That has now been
changed. Find Data dialog has been updated to always show the active
selection, no matter how it was created.


Selection Inspector panel has been removed. Selection Inspector was
primarily used to control how selections are labelled, their font
properties, etc. One can affect these directly from the Find Data dialog or
the new Selection Display Inspector which is dockable panel specially
designed for picking selection labels, label properties, or showing the
selection frustum for frustum based selections.

4_tJA> 





Enhancements for interactions with Plots

Inspired by plots in matplotlib, individual axes in line and bar charts can
now be zoomed by right-clicking and dragging along the x- or y- axis. Of
course, one can still drag diagonally to scale both axes as before. Also the
the user interactions for making new selections in line chart view have been
cleaned up to be more consistent with the render view.


Support for Python-based views

This release adds mechanisms to enable Python developers to integrate views
that use libraries such as matplotlib for rendering. This will make it
possible to take ParaView's charting capabilities even further. More details
on how to create such views can be found on Kitware blog
(http://www.kitware.com/blog/home/post/588
<http://www.kitware.com/blog/home/post/588> ).


ParaView Catalyst: Zero-Copy infrastructure for transferring data

A set of experimental interfaces have been added for reusing simulation
memory in portions of a Catalyst pipeline. A vtkMappedDataArray subclass may
be used for attribute/coordinate arrays, and vtkMappedUnstructuredGrid is
used for dataset topologies. More information can be found at
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/CoProcessing#Experimental:_Reusing_simulation_m
emory
<http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/CoProcessing#Experimental:_Reusing_simulation_
memory> .


ParaView Catalyst: Editions

Several new editions of ParaView Catalyst are now available for download and
are routinely built and tested. These editions are:


Base

minimal set of dependencies needed for Catalyst

Base-Python

Base with Python support

Essentials

Base + dependencies needed for Calculator, Contour, Clip, Cut and Glyph
filters.

Essentials-Python

Essentials with Python support

Extras

Essentials + dependencies needed for ExtractHistogram, WarpScalar,
WarpVector, IntegrateAttributes, Extract Surface filters.

Extras-Python

Extras with Python support


SurfaceLIC and support for Parallel Rendering

One of the notable community contributions for this release includes
extensions to the ParaView Line Integral Convolution contributed by Lawrence
Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL). Details can be found on the Wiki
(http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Line_Integral_Convolution
<http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Line_Integral_Convolution> ). The
implementation has been designed to work with composite data in parallel and
includes a number of customizations that facilitate interactive data
exploration.

Updates to ParaViewWeb

ParaViewWeb was integrated into ParaView binaries in the previous release.
This release includes several fixes and enhancements to simplify use and
deployment as well as updates to the WebGL rendering support. This
implementation supports modern browsers with WebSocket capabilities
including Safari 6+, Chrome 14+, Firefox 11+ and IE 10+.


As always, we look forward to your feedback (http://paraview.uservoice.com
<http://paraview.uservoice.com> ).

Seb/ Christoph,

I may be wrong, and there may be ways to get around it (such as the discussion in the mailing list below), but I believe that this feature has to be done on a reader by reader basis.  If so, it isn't a trivial amount of work.  Further, there are readers that do have this feature - such as the Exodus reader.

Can you give an official statement whether this is planned for the near
future? Is there a technical or other reason that makes this button so
difficult to implement? How about a fund raising campaign to get some
money for its development? I am sure there are plenty of bugged users
willing to sponsor the reload button.

Love your work,

Can you try running ParaView with "-dr" command line option and see if the
problem persists?

Hello,
I just try to compile Paraview 4.1 and it fails due to a wrong MD5
hash - do I do something wrong or is this a bug?
Here is the relevant output of the compilation process:

Hi Alan,

I agree and what you are stating is what I was trying to say in my e-mail.
Just that for some of them the trick that I mentioned could work?

If I run with the "-dr" flag, the color map window shows up inside of the
main GUI (on the right hand side of the GL window) and works correctly.   If
I drag the color map editor tool outside of the main gui,  I get the same
behavior of the window disappearing if the cursor is outside of the main GL
window.

Rick,

Can you try running ParaView with "-dr" command line option and see if the
problem persists?

	Subject: [Paraview] ANN: ParaView 4.1.0 is available for download
	
	Folks,
	
	
	
	
	ParaView 4.1.0 is now available for download
	(http://paraview.org/paraview/resources/software.php
	<http://paraview.org/paraview/resources/software.php> ). With over
170
	issues resolved, this release includes several bug fixes and feature
	enhancements. For a detailed list of issues resolved, refer to the
change
	log (http://paraview.org/Bug/changelog_page.php
	<http://paraview.org/Bug/changelog_page.php> ).  Some of the notable
	enhancements in this release are as follows:
	
	
	Redesigned Color Map Editor panel
	
	This release introduces a completely designed panel for editing
color and
	opacity transfer functions for scalar coloring. The panel, which is
now a
	dockable widget, instead of a popup dialog, makes it easier to edit
transfer
	functions as well as edit labels and annotations on the color legend
or
	scalar bar. This also makes it easier to access some of the
functionality
	introduced in the previous version of ParaView, such as categorical
colors.
	It is now easier to edit transfer functions when using log scaling
as the
	transfer function editor view now switches to log space.

	Enhancements to Find Data dialog
	
	Find Data dialog, introduced several versions ago, has quickly
become of the
	main mechanisms for creating new selections. However, until now, if
the user
	created selection using some other mechanism, such as selecting
cells in the
	3D view, the Find Data dialog could not be used to inspect that
selection.
	One had to use what was called the Selection Inspector. That has now
been
	changed. Find Data dialog has been updated to always show the active
	selection, no matter how it was created.
	
	
	Selection Inspector panel has been removed. Selection Inspector was
	primarily used to control how selections are labelled, their font
	properties, etc. One can affect these directly from the Find Data
dialog or
	the new Selection Display Inspector which is dockable panel
specially
	designed for picking selection labels, label properties, or showing
the
	selection frustum for frustum based selections.

	Enhancements for interactions with Plots
	
	Inspired by plots in matplotlib, individual axes in line and bar
charts can
	now be zoomed by right-clicking and dragging along the x- or y-
axis. Of
	course, one can still drag diagonally to scale both axes as before.
Also the
	the user interactions for making new selections in line chart view
have been
	cleaned up to be more consistent with the render view.
	
	
	Support for Python-based views
	
	This release adds mechanisms to enable Python developers to
integrate views
	that use libraries such as matplotlib for rendering. This will make
it
	possible to take ParaView's charting capabilities even further. More
details
	on how to create such views can be found on Kitware blog
	(http://www.kitware.com/blog/home/post/588
	<http://www.kitware.com/blog/home/post/588> ).
	
	
	ParaView Catalyst: Zero-Copy infrastructure for transferring data
	
	A set of experimental interfaces have been added for reusing
simulation
	memory in portions of a Catalyst pipeline. A vtkMappedDataArray
subclass may
	be used for attribute/coordinate arrays, and
vtkMappedUnstructuredGrid is
	used for dataset topologies. More information can be found at
	
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/CoProcessing#Experimental:_Reusing_simulation_m
	emory
	
<http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/CoProcessing#Experimental:_Reusing_simulation_
	memory> .
	
	
	ParaView Catalyst: Editions
	
	Several new editions of ParaView Catalyst are now available for
download and
	are routinely built and tested. These editions are:
	
	
	Base
	
	minimal set of dependencies needed for Catalyst
	
	Base-Python
	
	Base with Python support
	
	Essentials
	
	Base + dependencies needed for Calculator, Contour, Clip, Cut and
Glyph
	filters.
	
	Essentials-Python
	
	Essentials with Python support
	
	Extras
	
	Essentials + dependencies needed for ExtractHistogram, WarpScalar,
	WarpVector, IntegrateAttributes, Extract Surface filters.
	
	Extras-Python
	
	Extras with Python support
	
	
	SurfaceLIC and support for Parallel Rendering
	
	One of the notable community contributions for this release includes
	extensions to the ParaView Line Integral Convolution contributed by
Lawrence
	Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL). Details can be found on the
Wiki
	(http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Line_Integral_Convolution
	<http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Line_Integral_Convolution> ). The
	implementation has been designed to work with composite data in
parallel and
	includes a number of customizations that facilitate interactive data
	exploration.

I suspect that has something to do with KDE/X Windowing system. I wonder if
anyone else on this list has seen this problem.

Mathias,

The testing data server can be a bit flaky. You can just do a "make" again.
Alternatively, you can disable testing by turning off BUILD_TESTING cmake
flag and those data files won't be downloaded.

Subject: [Paraview] ParticleTracer particle lifetime
Message-ID: <CAJAZx5ArbM=Hn7vMjB5aFtDr6d2CHCMqBH=KcqPOfVQMvaYjAA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am continuing my ongoing quest to do something like this
http://earth.nullschool.net/#current/wind/isobaric/1000hPa/orthographic=267.73,5.54,350
or this
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xusdWPuWAoU
in Paraview using ***time dependent velocity vectors***.

While the LIC plugin is very cool, it does something different. I followed
the previous suggestion and tried to use the streamline filter:
http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Custom_Filters
Unfortunately that is not quite right either.

The problem with the streamline filter is that it treats each timestep as
completely independent and regenerates the streamlines whenever the
velocity field changes. (This is the correct behavior: streamlines are
defined by the *instantaneous* flow.)

What we see in those videos are truly particle trajectories. In particular:
- particles are seeded randomly (in space and time)
- they leave a decaying trail (sometimes called a streaklet)
- the particles disappear after a short lifetime
This is the combination of ingredients I need to reproduce in paraview.

The best candidate is clearly the ParticleTracer filter. However, I have
hit a serious problem: it doesn't appear that this filter is able to make
the particles "die" after a temporal lifetime. Compare the v 3.3
documentation
http://paraview.org/OnlineHelpCurrent/ParticleTracer.html
with the current documentation
http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Users_Guide/List_of_filters#ParticleTracer
In the old version, there was an option called "Termination Time" that is
missing from the new version.

Without such an option, the particles will never disappear, the domain will
get more and more crowded, and the computational expense will grow with
time.

Let me know if you have any suggestions or if you know how to re-enable
this Termination Time option.

Thanks a lot,
Ryan

Hi Ryan,

When I look at these  movies carefully, it looks like they are using
streaklines that are seeded for a short burst. It looks like they pick
a number of seeds each time step and start a streakline from each and
keep them active for a few time steps. Then those streaklines seem to
be killed eventually. It also appears as if they are playing with
transparency depending on the age of the streakline. Am I right?

Hi Ryan,
The following thread might be useful in trying to get pathlines/streaklines
to work in paraview.

Berk,
That might be the correct interpretation for the first video, which I think
uses a steady (i.e. not time-dependent) flow field. For steady flows,
streamlines, streaklines, and trajectories are all identical.
But if you look at the second video, I think you can see that they are
plotting Lagrangian trajectories. My velocity data is time-dependent, so I
think I need the trajectories.

I got it. I think that the correct way of doing this would be:

1. Seed particles
2. Integrate 1 time step
3. Kill particles that are older that threshold
4. Connect particles to generate streaklets
5. If time step % n == 0, update seed source randomly
6. Go to 1 if time step left

Does this make sense?

Yes, that sounds very sensible!

Of course, the difficult part (for me, a relative noob) is to actually
implement those steps in terms of a Paraview pipeline. Or would you
recommend creating a new custom filter?

Unfortunately experimentation has been difficult because of the slowness /
instability of the ParticleTracer filter. Even with a very modest number of
particles (~10), I experience crippling delays when advancing timesteps.
Perhaps pre-generating the trajectories is the answer.

Thanks a lot for your suggestions.

Subject: [Paraview] color using side set ID
Message-ID: <73D3E9199FB85E4A9E5A951440095C442F8B1D4F@ECS-EXG-P-MB03.win.lanl.gov>

Hello Paraview people,

I'm sure this is something simple that I'm missing, but my google-fu and RTFM-fu is failing me.

I have Exodus meshes which include Side Sets.  In paraview 3.14.1, I was able to look at these side sets as they would show up in the generic list of "Sets" after loading the mesh as "Unnamed set ID: X".  Then selecting these and de-selecting all Blocks, and coloring by ObjectID would color the various side sets.

In paraview 3.98/4.0, this "Sets" panel has gone away.  If I click on the "Information" tab, I can still see that Paraview recognizes my sets as "Side Sets", but all statistics are "NA", and I cannot for the life of me figure out how to view these.

I assume this capability has not gone away, and that I'm doing something wrong, so any suggestions would be helpful.  Thanks,

Ethan

Hi Scott,
thanks for your clarification. I wasn't aware of the fact, 
that
the reload button has to be written for every reader.
Now I see that it will be a lot of work to get the reload 
button.
On the other hand, reader by reader this feature could be 
implemented.

I am using the VTK reader and will try Sebastien's work 
around. Thanks
so far. This won't cover the numerious wishes for the reload 
button
but alleviate my pain.

I am still wondering why Kitware / the ParaView devs do not 
communicate
the reasons better. I know users switching to VisIt only due 
to its
reload button. Please update your statements on uservoice and 
the bug
tracker. Otherwise people might think you don't listen.

Thanks for the answers,
Christoph

Hi Ryan,

(4) and (5) won't work out of box and need some thinking. (3) can be
implemented by applying Threshold after the particle tracer.

I am not aware of any particular issues - other than general slowness
but not as bad as you describe - with the particle tracer. Do you have
some data that I can experiment with?

Note that if you jump around in time, the particle filter can be very
slow specially with time dependent data. It has to regenerate the
particle paths for all of the times in between if you do that, which
means loading a lot of data from disk. It should be relatively fast
when animating forward in time.

It used to work just fine jumping around in time - and I implemented it
that way so that one could do just that - setting up animations to look
just right often requires that kind of playing (and I?m quite upset that
it isn?t possible now). Since you chaps messed around with it, it?s awful,
and implementing the time steps as a recursive call is really dreadful.
Debugging the particle tracer now means stack traces of many thousands of
lines.

Just my grumpy 2c.

Okay, I figured it out, although I'm still confused.  Resolution add -connect_id to both cluster and desktop.

The cluster reverse connecting was handshaking with an appended connect_id.  I had initially tried not using a connect_id, but it errors out saying it's required.

The desktop doesn't have one, unless I add it in on the command line run.

Any idea why the server is requiring one?  Also is there a way to add in the connect_id through the GUI as opposed to through the command line?

Thanks,

Subject: Re: [Paraview] [EXTERNAL] Client/Server connection problems

Nathan,

First, let me clarify what is "checked", since what Alan said isn't entirely correct.

What comprises the handshake?
========================

The handshake is a string of the following form:
     paraview.<MajorNumber>.<MinorNumber>
If a connect-id is specified then the handshake becomes:
     paraview.<MajorNumber>.<MinorNumber>.connect_id.<ConnectId>

The client and the root-server node exchange these strings. If either side concludes that they don't match, the connection is terminated.
To debug, you can put a "cout" in vtkTCPNetworkAccessManager::ConnectToRemove(), or vtkTCPNetworkAccessManager::ParaViewHandshake() call on both(or either) sides to print the relevant string.

How is the MajorNumber/MinorNumber determined?
=====================================

First, it's hardcoded in the top level CMakeLists.txt. Any time a version number changes, this is manually updated. So on "git/master", this will change when we changed from 4.0.1 to 4.1.0-RC1. Thus, even before the official release the version number has changed. This could explain why two builds from "git master" may not always work with each other.

Secondly, if the source repository is a git repository (nothing to do with whether it has access to the Internet), then the version is determined by using the git command "git describe". By making sure we "tag" the repository when the CMakeLists.txt change happens, we ensure that "git describe" results in version numbers of the form "<MajorNumber>.<MinorNumber>-<FOO>-<BAR>". We can ignore FOO/BAR for now. These are extra annotations that us determine exactly what  source version you're using, esp when doing git/master builds.

The thing to note is that the handshake only uses the <MajorNumber> and <MinorNumber>. So even if your git/master checkouts are from slightly different points in history, they can work together (unless of course, the two checkout happened to be across a version number change).

Hope that clarifies things. Putting a cout in vtkTCPNetworkAccessManager and comparing the handshake strings would be a good start to debug this.

I believe that they now look at not just ParaView version numbers, but also git checkin "tags" or whatever it is called.  If the two trees are basically the same, and ANYONE touched the tree between pulls, that is your problem.  This has been an issue for me when one of the two (client or server) is behind a firewall, but the other can connect back to Kitware and find that git tag.  Make sure the source trees are exactly the same.

Ethan,

The properties panel has changed to move some of the less often used
properties to the "advanced" mode. Refer to
http://www.kitware.com/blog/home/post/491 for details.
The "Sets" selection is still present, just is advanced by default. Either
search for "Sets"  by typing the same text in the "Search box" at the top
of the panel or switch to advanced mode to see it.

Greetings !
I was also looking for a way to have a refresh button when reading vtk files.
The plugin given on the page you linked works wonderfully !

Thanks Bruno !

Subject: [Paraview] show a time-serie rotation of a mesh
Message-ID: <1e57ae819a975a8f467a0feae8a59dfd@innosea.fr>

 

Hi, 

I need to know how it is possible to apply a motion (time-serie) to a
mesh, loaded in Paraview from a VTK file. I do have a time series of the
angular position around one point, but I can't visualise it in paraview.
What I am trying to do is basically to rotate all the points (and then
all cells) of a mesh for each time step. Is there a filter or an easy
way to do it ? I couldn't find anything relevant for that case on
internet.

Hi Vincent,


Try Cell Centers filter.
Maybe normals are mapped to points (generated at cell centers).
Next applying Glyph filter and you may get expected results.

Classification: UNCLASSIFIED
Caveats: NONE

I have verified that the issue is specific to KDE ... If I run the GNOME
window manager on the same workstation,  the pop-up behaves correctly.
Curiously, the behavior only impacts the color map editor.   Other pop-up
windows (file select, python window, connection window, etc) all behave
correctly using KDE.

I suspect that has something to do with KDE/X Windowing system. I wonder if
anyone else on this list has seen this problem.

download
	
	        Folks,
	
	
	
	
	        ParaView 4.1.0 is now available for download
	        (http://paraview.org/paraview/resources/software.php
	        <http://paraview.org/paraview/resources/software.php> ).
With over
	170
	        issues resolved, this release includes several bug fixes and
feature
	        enhancements. For a detailed list of issues resolved, refer
to the
	change
	        log (http://paraview.org/Bug/changelog_page.php
	        <http://paraview.org/Bug/changelog_page.php> ).  Some of the
notable
	        enhancements in this release are as follows:
	
	
	        Redesigned Color Map Editor panel
	
	        This release introduces a completely designed panel for
editing
	color and
	        opacity transfer functions for scalar coloring. The panel,
which is
	now a
	        dockable widget, instead of a popup dialog, makes it easier
to edit
	transfer
	        functions as well as edit labels and annotations on the
color legend
	or
	        scalar bar. This also makes it easier to access some of the
	functionality
	        introduced in the previous version of ParaView, such as
categorical
	colors.
	        It is now easier to edit transfer functions when using log
scaling
	as the
	        transfer function editor view now switches to log space.

	        Enhancements to Find Data dialog
	
	        Find Data dialog, introduced several versions ago, has
quickly
	become of the
	        main mechanisms for creating new selections. However, until
now, if
	the user
	        created selection using some other mechanism, such as
selecting
	cells in the
	        3D view, the Find Data dialog could not be used to inspect
that
	selection.
	        One had to use what was called the Selection Inspector. That
has now
	been
	        changed. Find Data dialog has been updated to always show
the active
	        selection, no matter how it was created.
	
	
	        Selection Inspector panel has been removed. Selection
Inspector was
	        primarily used to control how selections are labelled, their
font
	        properties, etc. One can affect these directly from the Find
Data
	dialog or
	        the new Selection Display Inspector which is dockable panel
	specially
	        designed for picking selection labels, label properties, or
showing
	the
	        selection frustum for frustum based selections.

	        Enhancements for interactions with Plots
	
	        Inspired by plots in matplotlib, individual axes in line and
bar
	charts can
	        now be zoomed by right-clicking and dragging along the x- or
y-
	axis. Of
	        course, one can still drag diagonally to scale both axes as
before.
	Also the
	        the user interactions for making new selections in line
chart view
	have been
	        cleaned up to be more consistent with the render view.
	
	
	        Support for Python-based views
	
	        This release adds mechanisms to enable Python developers to
	integrate views
	        that use libraries such as matplotlib for rendering. This
will make
	it
	        possible to take ParaView's charting capabilities even
further. More
	details
	        on how to create such views can be found on Kitware blog
	        (http://www.kitware.com/blog/home/post/588
	        <http://www.kitware.com/blog/home/post/588> ).
	
	
	        ParaView Catalyst: Zero-Copy infrastructure for transferring
data
	
	        A set of experimental interfaces have been added for reusing
	simulation
	        memory in portions of a Catalyst pipeline. A
vtkMappedDataArray
	subclass may
	        be used for attribute/coordinate arrays, and
	vtkMappedUnstructuredGrid is
	        used for dataset topologies. More information can be found

	        ParaView Catalyst: Editions
	
	        Several new editions of ParaView Catalyst are now available
for
	download and
	        are routinely built and tested. These editions are:

Hello Ramiz

I believe you need to create a GridCollection, and set the CollectionType
Attribute to "Temporal". Then give each Grid in the Collection the
appropriate Time attribute. I've attached the output from one of the
example programs included in the XDMF2 repository that illustrates this.

Cheers
Jason

Interesting, not totally shocking though. The color editor does create an
OpenGL viewport to render the transfer function widget, none of the other
dialogs do. That could explain why it doesnt' like being popped out. It
could be a combination of KDE/Qt version. We will be updating to Qt 5.0
soon. It will be worth trying to see if that address this issue.

Christoph,

The issues Alan pointed out are indeed some of the concerns. It's been that
and priorities of the sources that fund ParaView development that we never
got around to investigating this too deeply or coming up with an all
encompassing solution. Maybe we start by picking a small set of readers to
start adding this support to and that could be a good way to attack this.

If we were to come with with such as readers list, what would those be?

Subject: Re: [Paraview] [EXTERNAL] Client/Server connection problems

Okay, I figured it out, although I'm still confused.  Resolution add -connect_id to both cluster and desktop.

The cluster reverse connecting was handshaking with an appended connect_id.  I had initially tried not using a connect_id, but it errors out saying it's required.

The desktop doesn't have one, unless I add it in on the command line run.

Any idea why the server is requiring one?  Also is there a way to add in the connect_id through the GUI as opposed to through the command line?

Thanks,

Subject: Re: [Paraview] [EXTERNAL] Client/Server connection problems

Nathan,

First, let me clarify what is "checked", since what Alan said isn't entirely correct.

What comprises the handshake?
========================

The handshake is a string of the following form:
     paraview.<MajorNumber>.<MinorNumber>
If a connect-id is specified then the handshake becomes:
     paraview.<MajorNumber>.<MinorNumber>.connect_id.<ConnectId>

The client and the root-server node exchange these strings. If either side concludes that they don't match, the connection is terminated.
To debug, you can put a "cout" in vtkTCPNetworkAccessManager::ConnectToRemove(), or vtkTCPNetworkAccessManager::ParaViewHandshake() call on both(or either) sides to print the relevant string.

How is the MajorNumber/MinorNumber determined?
=====================================

First, it's hardcoded in the top level CMakeLists.txt. Any time a version number changes, this is manually updated. So on "git/master", this will change when we changed from 4.0.1 to 4.1.0-RC1. Thus, even before the official release the version number has changed. This could explain why two builds from "git master" may not always work with each other.

Secondly, if the source repository is a git repository (nothing to do with whether it has access to the Internet), then the version is determined by using the git command "git describe". By making sure we "tag" the repository when the CMakeLists.txt change happens, we ensure that "git describe" results in version numbers of the form "<MajorNumber>.<MinorNumber>-<FOO>-<BAR>". We can ignore FOO/BAR for now. These are extra annotations that us determine exactly what  source version you're using, esp when doing git/master builds.

The thing to note is that the handshake only uses the <MajorNumber> and <MinorNumber>. So even if your git/master checkouts are from slightly different points in history, they can work together (unless of course, the two checkout happened to be across a version number change).

Hope that clarifies things. Putting a cout in vtkTCPNetworkAccessManager and comparing the handshake strings would be a good start to debug this.

Then no, that isn't the issue.

One more thing to try - and I don't completely know how to do it.  (i.e., ask Kitware).  I believe that they now look at not just ParaView version numbers, but also git checkin "tags" or whatever it is called.  If the two trees are basically the same, and ANYONE touched the tree between pulls, that is your problem.  This has been an issue for me when one of the two (client or server) is behind a firewall, but the other can connect back to Kitware and find that git tag.  Make sure the source trees are exactly the same.

That sounded promising, but it doesn't appear to have worked.  I deleted everything under .config/ParaView and .config/Kitware on both machines, still getting the same error.

Hi!

Use KDE 4.11 (TS has 3.5.4) and don't see this behaviour...

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview 4.1 with external tiff library
Message-ID: <20140115164545.GA4393@quark>

Hello,
I have a problem with compiling Paraview 4.1 using my own libtiff
(version 4.0.3, cmake flag VTK_USE_SYSTEM_TIFF=ON) and visitbridge
plugin (cmake flag PARAVIEW_USE_VISITBRIDGE=ON). When I try to compile
Paraview with these flags, it fails with

/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lvtktiff

a shortened compilation output can be found here:

http://sprunge.us/dUTT

If I set VTK_USE_SYSTEM_TIFF to OFF Paraview compiles fine and works.
I coult compile Paraview 4.0.1 with my own tiff library so I suspect a
bug in Paraview 4.1?
A similiar bug has been reported already for Paraview 3 here:

http://vtk.org/Bug/view.php?id=12849

Can anybody help me with this problem?
Thanks and greetings,
Mathias

Hi Vincent,

You have to use the transform filter to rotate your mesh, and then animate
the angle thanks to the Animation View.

Subject: [Paraview] ParaviewWeb change proxy properties using xml names
Message-ID: <CAOkZLxp7wnrZ6Wjr2WMNr7NJv8gXo_EPAC1NWpQ4w0PdV5=PCw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am using ParaviewWeb with a custom protocol in which I want to change
several properties of the proxies (e.g. the text colour) using the names
listed in

 ${src}/ParaViewCore/ServerManager/SMApplication/Resources/*.xml

I was wondering what the general way is to do that ?

In order to change e.g. the 'Color' property of proxy 'TextProperty' in
group 'properties' I tried:

prx = servermanager.CreateProxy("properties", "TextProperty")
prx.Color=[0.0, 1.0, 0.0]

But this does not seem to work.

Many thanks for any help

kyr.

Apply the glyph filter and choose the normals array as the vector to orient

Nice work on releasing 4.1! Thanks to all.

I read with interest the discussion about server-side plugins, and modified my custom plugins accordingly.

http://www.kitware.com/blog/home/post/594

installed a windows 64-bit pre-compiled, connected to my server, and indeed, I can visualize custom data. But the Manage Plugin tool still gave me an error message about "must be loaded on client as well". I ignored the message and was able to run. Have I forgotten some setting in my plugin?

client.

By default plugins are treated as "REQUIRED_ON_SERVER" and
"REQUIRED_ON_CLIENT". Simply add a REQUIRED_ON_SERVER flag in your
add_paraview_plugin(...) call.

For example:


 ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN(MyReader "1.0"
   SERVER_MANAGER_XML MyPNGReader.xml
   SERVER_MANAGER_SOURCES vtkMyPNGReader.cxx
   REQUIRED_ON_SERVER)


That should do the trick.

Subject: [Paraview] weird behavior with GroupDatasets filter
Message-ID: <CAJAZx5AYRe86z3sjPYvsYc6ogYYT=Szbmnf_jsfxq3BMehTv5g@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I have encountered a confusing behavior with the GroupDatasets filter. I
hope you can help me resolve it. My datasets are much too large to share on
the list, so hopefully the attached screenshots will suffice.

My pipeline begins with two VTK sources, both using the same rectilinear
grid. They are both timeseries: UV.0000*.vtr and THETA.0000*.vtr, with
identical sequence numbering. UV contains two point-data arrays (U and V),
while THETA contains only one (THETA).

I would like to group these two sources together so I can, for example, use
the calculator to calculate quantities based on both. However, when I use
the GroupDatasets filter, only one of the two sources is passed through
correctly. Even though they both appear, only the most recently added
dataset actually passes through its values.

This should be clear from the screenshots.

Here is the U variable, from the original source (UV.00000*)
[image: Inline image 1]

Here is the same variable from the GroupDatasets filter. Just zeros as far
as I can tell, although, curiously, the range is still detected correctly
for the colorbar. The variable name has also been changed to U (partial).
[image: Inline image 2]

In contrast, here is the THETA (partial) variable within the GroupDatasets
filter. As you can see, its values made it through fine.
[image: Inline image 3]

Please help me! This seems like a very straightforward thing to do, and I
can't understand why it doesn't work.

-Ryan

p.s. I am using 4.1.1, but I verified the same problem happens in 4.0.1.
p.p.s. Sorry for the low resolution of the images. The mailing list has
strict size limits.

Hi Utkarsh and Andy,

static linking *really* improves performance on Hopper. One issue though 
is that plugins are automatically "loaded", so when connecting to a 
statically linked server the plugin manager immediately pops up and 
requests that the user load all the plugins. Does the REQUIRED_ON_SERVER 
flag fix this? in other words is it just for readers? or does it work 
with other plugins as well?

Burlen,

It would work for everything, but for plugins that really need
client-side plugin to be loaded e.g. representation plugins, view
plugins, you should not do this. In other words, any plugin that only
is needed on the data processing side should indeed always use
REQUIRED_ON_SERVER flag. Anything else, shouldn't.

Thanks for the clarification. It'd be helpful if all of the builtin 
plugins that supported server only were setup that way. If they're not 
already that is.

Could the representations and view plugins also be supported seamlessly 
with out user intervention in a static link? Re: the plugins that are 
distributed with PV, and enabled by deafult, Couldn't the server side 
load trigger the client load automatically? That would be a nice 
improvement for the static link case, where we'd still want to make use 
of some of the view/rep plugins.

Hi Vincent,


Try Cell Centers filter.
Maybe normals are mapped to points (generated at cell centers).
Next applying Glyph filter and you may get expected results.

Hi Vincent,


I can't find what is happening.
If you can, please attach sample data to your mail.

I tried displaying normals of Sphere sources,
and succeeded with the 3D Glyph filter.
It's better for you to try simple datasets.

Message-ID: <2b1afa04c2e02ba0e58a24fd83c2f702 at innosea.fr> Content-Type: text/plain; charset="utf-8" Hi, I am a new user of Paraview. I am facing a problem I cannot solve and I have not found any relevant practice on the internet (guide user, mailing, ...)... I want to visualise my mesh with normals specified IN MY VTK FILE (and NOT the Normals Glyphs calculated by the software) (I have these normals calculations in another code and I do not want to change that). I am importing a mesh in Paraview from a VTK file. The VTK file contains the following elements: # vtk DataFile Version 2.0 hydrodynamic vtk mesh for paraview vizu ASCII DATASET POLYDATA POINTS 458 float x0 y0 z0 (points coordinates) ... ... ... ....... POLYGONS 465 2325 4 n1 n2 n3 n4 (points IDs) 4 ... ... ... ... ...... CELL_DATA 465 NORMALS cell_normals float ... ... ... (normals coordinates) A 'cell_normals' array appears in 'Information'; I am able to color the surface (each cell) of the mesh according to the values of the cell_normals array (Magnitude, X, Y or Z) but nothing more. This gives me information on the normals orientation but I have no visual on the vectors. How is it possible de visualise these normals (displayed as vectors) on Paraview without calculating them with the software? What is the correct pratice ? I need to know if they are well oriented, I also need some visual on the mesh I am studying. Thanks a lot, Best regards. -- Vincent

Subject: [Paraview] Scene exporter development : Information and resources
Message-ID: <52DB5DB7.6060707@gmail.com>

Hi,

     I am exploring the possibility of writing additional exporter for 
Paraview 4.1 e.g. for Renderman and Arnold. I will most likely base it 
on POV.

     Which URL should I start with ? I have found this 
http://paraview.org/Wiki/Exporting_Scenes but could not find additional 
resources from a developer's perspective i.e. information about 
registration of plugin/functionality etc.

     I am familiar with building using CMake and have written and 
participated in VTK->RIB in the past (long time ago [C++]).

     I am guessing that with Paraview, most things are done via Python.

Cheers

Hi all,


I have sequential CSVs of pointclouds and the size of each data is MBs.
When 'Cache Geometry' is off, the animations on 3D View are very slow.
But when the setting is on, the animations are extremely fast.

I'd like to control the animations' speed of Views on PV.
Any ideas?

Open up the animation view (Views -> Animation View), change the mode to real time, and set the duration to the number of seconds you want the animation to last. There are more details in the ParaView tutorial. (I expect the users guide also has details, but I have not checked.)

Hi Utkarsh,
as you asked for my opinion: I use the file formats VTU, VTP, and PVD
and would like to see a reload button them. As a first step a reload
button should just reload the currently visible file. As a next step, I
would love to see that for multiple files there number is updated, too.

I would also consider the needs of large user groups like openFOAM users.

Burlen,

That's a good  point. Mind reporing a bug for this? Upgrading the
ParaViewPlugins.cmake file has been on my wish list for a while now.
They macros have never been revisited or cleanup since their
inception. I would like to collect such feature requests so we can
take all such things into consideration when cleaning that up.

I thought I fixed all of the reader and writer plugins in the
ParaView/Plugins directory to be server side only, unless they needed to
modify the GUI (maybe the SLAC reader did). I didn't check on any of the
other plugins though.

Nicholas,

There's not much to it once you have the vtkExporter subclass ready.
For making that exporter available in ParaView, you create a XML
putting the definition under the "exporters" group. The proxy
definition should use a
(http://www.paraview.org/ParaView3/Doc/Nightly/www/cxx-doc/classvtkSMExporterProxy.html)
(or subclass, e.g. RenderViewExporterProxy).

The exporter dialog when created looks for all definitions available
under the "exporters" group that "CanExport"
(http://www.paraview.org/ParaView3/Doc/Nightly/www/cxx-doc/classvtkSMExporterProxy.html#a6a12e9c1401140db5a278617901a0603)
the active view and add that exporter's extension to the list.

Ryan,

What are the extents of the two vtr files? Are you sure that the U
(partial) is indeed lost or we just don't see it since the second VTR
without the variable gets rendered on top of the one that has it?

checked separately for each of the axis - X,Y and Z.

I am not sure I understand what you're trying to do. Do you want to
access the pixel buffer to "read" the image rendered by ParaView or
"write" to the image rendered in ParaView?

I?m using Python to generate a set of plots which contain paraview-rendered images. Rather than writing the images to disk using WriteImage, and then reading them back in to create the plots using matplotlib, I?d like to access the render window pixel buffer directly. Is this possible?

Dear Giuseppe,

Yes I remember the issue. I have a test data set, and I just tested it. It
works with version 4.1. Send me your data set and I'll look at what we
might have missed.

Best regards,

Hi there,
I've installed ParaviewWeb from source and configured apache to work with
jetty. I think I've done every configuration according to the tutorials.
But everytime I try to open DataProber application I face with the
following error in Jetty console output:

In the firebug, I see the following error:

Any ideas?

The web socket forwarding should be handle by Apache at that point and it
seems to be done by Jetty?
In your jetty configuration, the session URL might not be valid when using
Apache as a front-end.

Moreover, which Apache setup did you used? 2.4+ like for the EC2 Amazon
documentation or the old one with the Python module?

Thanks for your reply.
Previously, I was following the old model approach using apache 2.2. Now, I
upgraded to Apache 2.4.7. And followed the Amazon EC2 tutorial. However,
now I get the following message in the firebug which the rickshaw.min.js
file generated that:
Firefox can't establish a connection to the server at
ws://pvwserver/proxy?sessionId=9521c7c5-d2c6-4e9d-980e-5c7ea9f7dfd4.

Is it related to the rewriting module? Maybe it's not working! Any idea?
I've attached my 'pw-config.properties' and 'httpd-vhosts.conf' files to
this thread.

Regards,

Looking quickly at your files, everything seems fine.
But did you patch Apache, like the documentation explain? Or did you just
used the binaries?
I guess the "pvwserver" host name is known by your web client?

Did you check if the pvpython process was running and if the proper mapping
information were written inside the mapping file?

Sorry, but that's not supported currently. It may not be too
complicated to move a pqTabbedMultiView into a separate Window
however. Feel free to add a feature request to the bug tracker
(http://paraview.org/Bug)

Just wanted to jump in here.  The patch instructions are, strangely,
missing from that Amazon EC2 setup documentation.  That's my fault, since I
wrote it.  I'll update the documenation with the steps below, which should
have been in there all along.  However, I just checked, and the version
you're using (2.4.7) already has the patch included, so these steps really
only apply to versions 2.4.6 and earlier.  Sorry for the oversight.

1)  Download the patch:

wget -O patch.txt
https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/attachment.cgi?id=30886&action=diff&context=patch&collapsed=&headers=1&format=raw

2) Change to the root of the httpd source tree and patch the source:

patch -u -p1 < path-to-patch/patch.txt

If you're interested in trying some experimental code out, attached is
a partial patch. There are a few issues that need to be addressed
before this goes in the ParaView repo.

Subject: [Paraview] VRML File crashing ParaView 4.1
Message-ID: <F613DD06-CFEF-4BD7-A2B3-332E2AF920A2@bluequartz.net>

The following VRML file crashes ParaView 4.1 on OS X.

#VRML V2.0 utf8

Shape {
	geometry IndexedFaceSet {
		coord DEF MYPOINTS Coordinate {
			point  [
				0,0,0,
				1,0,0,
				1,1,0,
				0,1,0,
				0,2,0,
				1,2,0
			]
		}
		coordIndex [
			0,1,2,3,-1

		]
	}
}

Shape {
	geometry IndexedFaceSet {
		coord USE MYPOINTS
		coordIndex [
			3,2,5,-1
		]
	}
}


I was trying to write some VRML exporters for some custom codes and using ParaView to view the output. After a lot of failures I started seeking out examples on the internet. This file is supposedly valid but will crash ParaView. Can anyone either confirm this or point out the issues with the file?

THanks

Thanks for mentioning that. I've got stuck in running PW, trying every
solution and wondering why it doesn't work!!

Anyway, since I didn't have any other choice I decided to patch my Apache
2.4.7 source and then recompile it. Now, when I try to run the 'make' it
throws the following error:
mod_rewrite.c: In function ?is_absolute_uri?:
mod_rewrite.c:600: error: duplicate case value
mod_rewrite.c:589: error: previously used here
mod_rewrite.c:601: error: duplicate case value

Shouldn't I patch my source??

Hello Utkarsh,
sorry for the late delay but finally I found some time to test your
patch and it works flawlessly, I can compile and use Paraview 4.1 with
my local tiff library.
So can you please include this patch in the next release of Paraview?

Hello Mike.

This VRML file crashes all Paraview versions since 3.14.
Test made on Linux Centos 6 with PV 64 bits 3.14.1, 3.98.1, 4.0.1 and 4.1.0

Found on internet other VRML file OK:

Found the error on your file: points coordinates should be separated by 
a space. The comma should be used only to separate points:

I don't know if PV shows what your are expecting but it does not crash.

The files from this VTK bug report will crash ParaView:

http://paraview.org/Bug/print_bug_page.php?bug_id=1624

I am using "Instant Player" by Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft version 2.3.0 to view all the files that ParaView crashes on. ParaView will load simple VRML files but I think it may be the IndexedFaceList that is the problem?

The last few lines of the crash log are attached at the the bottom.

Subject: [Paraview] PointSprite with Recent Intel HD Graphics
Message-ID: <CAEc4V-aUH3kECmqfBEYeFWwqK89mDNCibFcZO2bh3XbtjOWznw@mail.gmail.com>

When using the PointSprite plugin on a new laptop I found two options cause
it to stop working.

When changing from "Sphere (texture)" to "Sphere"  get the following,

ERROR: In
C:\DBD\pvs-x64\paraview\src\paraview\VTK\Rendering\OpenGL\vtkOpenGLProperty.cxx,
line 415

vtkPointSpriteProperty (000000000BD110B0): Couldn't build the shader
program. At this point , it can be an error in a shader or a driver bug.


I thought this might be due to lack of opengl support for the graphics
chip, which comes bundled with the I7-4600u I have. However intel claim it
supports up to version 4.2 of OpenGL, so that should be fine...


Also, when i choose to scale the point sprite size by values in an array, I
get the following error,


ERROR: In
C:\DBD\pvs-x64\paraview\src\paraview\VTK\Rendering\OpenGL\vtkShaderProgram2.cxx,
line 1084

vtkShaderProgram2 (0000000014D4A1A0): glGetAttribLocation 1 OpenGL errors
detected

 0 : (1281) Invalid value


Is there any solution for this?


Cheers,

Bruce

Is this a windows OS or Linux? If Linux can you send us the output of
glxinfo (as a starting point to debug this).

Thanks,

This is windows 8.1, is there a similar utility I can run on windows?

Cool. Thanks for testing. Yup, the patch it on it's way to the git
repo, so it will be included in the next release.

That patch was integrated into the master branch of Apache a while ago, but
I was not aware that it made it to the 2.4.7 release.
So, if you have Apache 2.4.7, you SHOULD NOT patch it.

The version that you had was correct and should have worked.
The remaining question is regarding the
file: /opt/apache-2.4.7/pv-mapping-file/mapping.txt

Is that file properly created? Does the content reflect the session id,
host and port as expected?

I went ahead and implemented this fix. It will be available in next
release if it doesn't cause any new issues.

Subject: [Paraview] a new user with a simple question
Message-ID: <CAPpq9iomrzcTaNGvpN_FjKZzrXFCSgxO8zJmjXpPwc=vawVpCg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello ParaView,

I tried to use ParaFoam (ParaView) with OpenFoam.  During my several
trial-and-error playing-without-knowing, I lost the "plotOverLine" display
(although the plotOverLine sub-window still comes up but without any curves
and axes appearing).  I wanted to get the original "settings" back (because
I had a working plotOverLine in the beginning), but haven't been able to.
I re-installed OpenFoam and re-compiled ParaFoam; neither of those could
get me a fresh start.  The ParaFoam window seems to always remember what I
had last time.   So, I wonder if you can tell me how I can get ParaView to
the initial (default?) state as if I had it installed the first time?
Thank you very much.

This web site tells you how to do it - from the ParaView Wiki.  http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView_Settings_Files.  Just delete the configuration files.

You can also find out if taking ParaView to initial conditions is what you want.  Run paraview -dr (disable registry), and that does the same thing as deleting the configuration files.

Yes, I checked that. There are some entries with the following pattern:  
97b94394-7edb-4b9b-b26a-4d76aee49925 pvwserver:9099

Just to let you know, I didn?t create the special group like mentioned in Amazon EC2 tutorial. I made this file?s permission to 777. I hope this wouldn?t be the cause of the problem.

Does the apache "user" can read that file?
Are all the directories above that file "executable" for that user?

Try by switching to that user and check if you can "cat"  that file.

Hello everyone. 

Does anybody have a working file with Hyperslabs?
 I can't get it work. I can only specify the number of points to show, but 
it is always the first 2,3,.. 1000 points. I can't make proper subsets. 
When I follow the example from the XDMF documentation, then nothing works 
at all.

This is the code I use.

Hi,

I finally have found a simple solution : instead of exporting the solution
in the CGNS format (from CFX), I now use Ensight files which Paraview is
able to read and which includes the boundaries. (accessible using the
ExtractBlock Filter)

However, it would be great to have a Filter that would be able to detect
the edges (discontinuity of curvature or of the the normal vector ?) on the
surface resulting from the ExtractSurface filter, and that will work on
both structured and unstructured Multiblock meshes.

Does that make sense to you ?

Regards,

Aur?lien

In addition, the FeatureEdge filter already allows to detect the edges on
the surface. Now, is it possible to split the surface in several blocks,
using these edges ?

Many thanks,

Aur?lien

Subject: [Paraview] details on glyph scaling
Message-ID: <loom.20140124T023309-460@post.gmane.org>

Hi,

I have a 3D vector field (vectors are 3D), and would like to visualize the
real length of the deformation vectors.

Could you explain how I use the SetScale factors to achieve this?

For example: If a point vector is [105um x 200um x 300um], then I want the
length of the glyph to be sqrt(105^2 + 200^2 + 300^2), and for it to have
the orientation that would be associated with a vector of such components.

Subject: [Paraview] details on glyph scaling
Message-ID: <CF07221C.1FE24%kmorel@sandia.gov>

Set the Scale Factor to 1 and the Scale Mode to vector. That should size
the arrow glyph to the length of the vector.

Subject: [Paraview] Vector with more than 3 components?
Message-ID: <52E229B5.3050400@iws.uni-stuttgart.de>

Hi ParaView,
multicomponent point data for ParaView is written as 'vector' data with
the desired number of components. In case numberOfComponents!=3 loading
such data in ParaView results in permanent warnings. According to the
following ParaView bug-report this can be avoided by using the 'scalar'
type with the desired number of components instead:

http://paraview.org/Bug/bug_relationship_graph.php?bug_id=12024&graph=relation

If 'vectors' is replaced by 'scalars' in the .vtu file ParaView does
indeed not complain any more. As this report is not commented and we
could not find appropriate documentation it's unclear if this is a
ParaView bug or if we misuse the 'vector' type.

Is it save to use scalar instead of vector for multicomponent point
data? Or will we lose some ParaView functionality?

Thanks for any comments,
Christoph

Dear all,

I do not find the command in order to get the names of blocks included in a
MultiBlockDatSet.
Does anyone knows it ?

Many thanks,

Not sure if there is anything easier but this should work:

I think you're missing the VTK submodule...do the following in the ParaView
git source dir

Hi Aur?lien and Paul,


Check the entry:

I think it's not easy to get indices of blocks.

Thank you.

Is there a URL to read up on how build build Paraview so that the 
headers and library files are also installed ?

My OS X install image does not come with the required vtkSMExporterProxy 
header file or library to build those plugins.

Cheers

I tried that.
I switched to 'daemon' user as the apache is set to work with. I could cat
the mapping.txt file without any problem.
I'm suspicious on mod_rewrite module. I think it may now working properly.
Do you have any idea that I could check it's functionality?
Do you have any clue that what would be the cause of this problem?

Thanks for your helps,

OK, I managed to solve the problem. The logs in /tmp/pw-logs/ helped me a
lot.
I had compiled the Paraview from source and in the log I saw that the
pvpython throws the following exception:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File
"/root/paraview/build/lib/site-packages/paraview/web/pv_web_data_prober.py",
line 37, in <module>
    from vtk.web import server
  File "/usr/local/lib/paraview-4.1/site-packages/vtk/web/server.py", line
27, in <module>
    from . import testing
  File "/usr/local/lib/paraview-4.1/site-packages/vtk/web/testing.py", line
71
    TestModuleBrowsers = type("Enum", (), {k: i for i, k in
enumerate(test_module_browsers)})
                                                  ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

So, I decided to use the binary version instead of the compiled one. Now,
It works properly.
Does the source have any bug you think?

Thanks for your help.

Ok, I've attached the output from glview. Everything is supported for
OpenGL <=4.2. versions 4.3 and 4.4 are partially supported.

Message-ID: <50320452A334BD42A5EC72BAD21450990FF363C7@MBX110.d.ethz.ch>

Does anyone know of a paper which gives statistics on usage of viz clusters?

In particular - I'm interested in knowing what the % usage of typical clusters is. Since they are often reserved for interactive use, they can spend a lot of time idle between reservations (and when nodes are reserved, hey may also be doing nothing)
Has anyone ever published statistics of usage? if so please send me links.

Many Thanks

JB

Subject: [Paraview] Table to Points and Threshold filter
In-Reply-To: <2317149.24.1390820369020.JavaMail.fnick@bromwich>
Message-ID: <16623333.26.1390820772886.JavaMail.fnick@bromwich>

Hi everyone,

I am new to ParaView and the following question has come up:

I have a file with a certain number of points as coordinates and integers between 1 and 5 assigned to every point. I.e. each row of the file looks like

x,y,int

x and y being the 2D coordinates, int the integer between 1 and five.

Now I saved this file as mesh.csv and imported this file into ParaView.
Next I added a "TableToPoints" filter, setting X Column to x, Y Column to y and Z Column to int.
I checked "2D points" and "Keep All Data Arrays". 
When I choose "int" in the Coloring section I see all my points in different colors according to the integer I've assigned them. So far so good.

Now I want to display only those points, which have been assigned a value between 2 and 5, for example. So I added a thershold filter, set it to visible, choose "int" from the Scalars Dropdown menu and set Minimum and Maximum to 2 and 5 respectively. However, although I've set the TableToPoints layer to invisible, I still see ALL the points (just not colored any more). I only want to see those with values between 2 and 5 though... So what am I doing wrong?

Thanks,
Fabian

Subject: [Paraview] Extract Selection using Python
Message-ID: <CAOkZLxr4+8O1a=spRavzwSCrt_W80QOwaH+99K=CvDk4v0BbuQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am trying to write a Python function that can be used in ParaviewWeb to
extract the values of a point data set after a selection has been made (I
am using basically pv_web_visualizer with a custom protocol that contains
my python functions). I am struggling with 2 problems:

1) I cannot figure out how to display the rectangle for the selection in
ParaviewWeb. With

 RenderView1 = simple.GetRenderView()
 RenderView1.InteractionMode = "Selection"

only the mouse mode is changed, but no rectangle is shown.


2)  Using the normal Paraview GUI, after I have made a selection I can do
in the Python shell:

sel=ExtractSelection()

this creates the Extract Selection filter which I need to finalize using
the 'Apply' button.

In the Python shell I can then access the data in that selection using:

datsel=servermanager.Fetch(sel)
ar0=datsel.GetPointData().GetArray(0)
ar0.GetTuple1(0)

In ParavewWeb, ExtractSelection  does not pick up any selection that I have
made. But it might also be that using the code in 1) is not enough to
enable the selection tool.

in ParaviewWeb, how can I obtain the IDs of the points in the selection so
that I can fetch the values ?

Any help or ideas would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you very much

kyr.

Fabian,

I don't see anything wrong with what you described. Mind attaching a sample
to illustrate the problem?

I think it is because the threshold filter operates on cells (and you don't
have any).  You could use the glyph filter to create a vertex for each
point and then it should work (e.g. select "2D Glyph" and "Vertex").

Regards,
Paul

I think Paul is right. As an alternative to creating glyphs, you can
use VTK's threshold points filter, which you can expose in ParaView by
loading this XML plugin:
https://raw.github.com/MADAI/MADAIWorkbench/master/Plugins/ThresholdPointsFilter/ThresholdPoints.xml

Best,
Cory

Hi Arya,

   That looks like a problem with the version of Python you were trying to
use.  I don't think ParaViewWeb supports Python versions lower than 2.7, so
you could check the version you were using before you switched to the
binary.  Maybe you were trying to use Python 2.6 or lower?  At any rate,
I'm glad you finally got it working.

Cheers,
Scott

Subject: [Paraview] MouseInteraction ParaviewWeb
Message-ID: <CAOkZLxrmSc_4V7jRmXw4Q-Hn3q8=2wjgCDACb-jue=fLm_1P_Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am usign ParaviewWeb (4.1) iwth a custom protocol in order to implemnet
some tools for my visualisation. I would like to read the mouse position
(at left-click) and use it.

In protocols.py there is the class ParaViewMouseHandler with the routine
mouseInteraction.

I was wondering if anybody could help with the usage of this function in
order to retrieve the mouse position when clicked ?

Many thanks

kyr.

Hi Kyr,

1) The rectangle should show up with master or 4.1 release.

2) The version 4.1 does have a protocol that manage selection, you may want
to start looking into that.

Subject: [Paraview] Comparing results computed with 2 different meshes
Message-ID: <CAEhu9hAN-ShDOBqCPkZ94m9AZpidr1hqgiK9iCb0vHWeQuVBaQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I'm trying to compare the results of 2 CFD simulations (which are imported
into Paraview as Ensight data) point-by-point but I'm having trouble
figuring out how to even combine the data into a single Pipeline object so
that I can do some simple calculations with the Calculator Filter.  I'd
appreciate it if anyone could let me know if what I'm trying to do is
natively possible in Paraview, and if not, provide some suggestions on how
to approach it.

What might complicate the process is that the results were obtained using
two different meshes (in fact, it's a mesh comparison test).  The points I
want to look at are the same for both meshes, but the point IDs are
different.

So what I'd like to do in summary is:
1) Is there a way to extract and sort the data in a way such that the point
IDs are the same for both meshes?

2) Is there a way to convert/manipulate the data into a single Pipeline
object for comparison?  Or to compare the results of different Pipeline
objects?  I've tried various combinations of filters like AppendDatasets,
GroupDatasets, and MergeBlocks with little success.

Thanks,
Evan

I have noticed the class with the StartSelection and EndSelection methods.

If I only use the StartSelection routine the InteractionMode is set
correctly, but I don't get the rectangle. Do I have to set any visibility ?

Where can I find  an example where the MouseInteraction method is used in a
ParaViewWeb application ?  I would like to use the mouse coordinates from 2
left-clicks to provide to the EndSelection routine.

Many thanks

kyr.

Thanks,

the Glyph+Treshold version worked, although I had to uncheck a couple of things (Mask Points, Random Mode, Keep Random Points) in the Glyph filter.

Message-ID: <7AE853BA-B5AF-4901-B3B2-F75B66B84DFB@mac.com>

Hi all,


I have sequential CSVs which only have contour values as m*n matrices.
I want to visualize and animate them like VTK Images (arrays of pixels),
but PV's CSV Reader requires values of each point.

My CSVs are exported and refreshed by other asynchronous softwares,
so I have to read the CSVs into PV without pre-processing them.
I think Programmable Source filter may be suitable, but I don't know
how to read sequential datasets with it.

Any ideas?

I am plotting a csv file with four coloums using the "Table to Point"
filter. The first three columns are the x,y and z coordinate. The fourth
column is the value of an scalar.  I am not able to colour the glyphs using
the value of the fourth column. I have attached an image which clearly
shows all the different parameters of my plot. I don't understand why
paraview is not getting the value range properly. It is also not working
when I am setting the range manually.

Any tips?

Clearly the range of values is wrong, as you point out. I have no idea why it would come up like that. Could you post your csv file so that we can try to replicate the problem? I've never seen that before.

Hello everyone, 

I have generated a temporal grid where each dataset  and HDF file 
corresponds to a time step. When I hit the Play button in ParaView, It 
shows only the current dataset,  and the data from previous time steps 
disappears. Is it possible to accumulate all the data as the time 
progresses? Is there some sort of buffer? I would like to see how the 
final shape is being build up over time, but all I see is the data from 
the current time steps. 
For example, my shape is a line, and I plot it point by point, but I don't 
get the line, I just see one point at time from that line. 
what I would like to see is this 

time step 1     1st point, 
time step 2     1st and 2nd point, 
time step 3     1st, 2nd, and 3rd point 
and etc. 

I tried using Hyperslab and it worked for XML, but it completely did not 
work for HDF
I used this approach: "0 1 3 " for time =1, " 0 1 4" for time =2 and etc. 
But once I but HDF instead of XML as my second data item of the HyperSlab, 
it shows garbage values.

I also used and Function="Join($0; $1)" , but it did not work with neither 
XML nor HDF. 
I tried to join two HFD vectors into a larger one, to old and new points 
at time=2, but no success. 

I also tried selecting a part of HDF5 data, using Fucntion="($0[0:4]", but 
it crashes.


Does anybody have any insight, or a HyperSlab   examples? or examples with 
Functions that work with HDF? 
I

I just tried your csv file with the latest version of ParaView, and it worked just fine. Is there any chance you can download the latest binary? From your screenshot it looks like you are using an old version that was in between official releases. Perhaps you are running into a bug that has already been fixed.

Clearly the range of values is wrong, as you point out. I have no idea why it would come up like that. Could you post your csv file so that we can try to replicate the problem? I've never seen that before.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [Paraview] Colouring glyph

I am plotting a csv file with four coloums using the "Table to Point" filter. The first three columns are the x,y and z coordinate. The fourth column is the value of an scalar.  I am not able to colour the glyphs using the value of the fourth column. I have attached an image which clearly shows all the different parameters of my plot. I don't understand why paraview is not getting the value range properly. It is also not working when I am setting the range manually.

Any tips?

Subject: [Paraview] How to compute functions for all particles and plot as
 function of time
Message-ID: <CA+8Z1WjyXZ9LwQu8_LbbY9PGP23=z-qNZV8cBjeYBvcjMppRvA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,
I have a system of particles printed on vtp files. I am visualising them on
Paraview, and want to analyse some dynamic info. Each particle has its own
position and velocity vectors, and mass (scalar) as well, plus some other
scalars and vectors not relevant now. Let/s say that I want to plot the
*total* kinetic energy as a function of time. I was able to plot the
individual kinetic energies per particle for each time (using the
calculator and plot data filters), and also to plot the kinetic energy for
a single selected  particle as function of time (after selecting the
particle and using the plot selection over time filter). But I haven't
found how to use the Python calculator or similar to compute that aggregate
quantity (total kinetic energy in this example), and to plot it as a
function of time.
Any help is greatly appreciated.

I don't know if this can be done.  The mouse doesn't actually move the data - it moves the camera.  Thus, as you move the camera, anything that you are looking at will appear to move.

Well, gosh, Tim. If you put it that way I wouldn't bet my life on it.

If the glyphs look wrong, it should be straightforward to check if the underlying vectors match. For example, if you are seeing vectors that look ridiculously large or small, you can use the Find Data dialog to see if the magnitude of any vectors are beyond some expected range. If you see a particular glyph that looks wrong, select the source data under it and look at the actual values of the vector.

Thanks for the response, Ken.

Are you absolutely, 'no-other-possibility' sure? I ask because my visualizations are non-sensical if this is the case, indicating that I may have more serious issues up the pipeline. I ask for you to re-confirm because before I sent the previous message, I had found many complaints online about the user-friendliness of glyph customization..

Thanks,

Tim

Have you tried selecting all the particles, then applying "Plot Selection

Hello
in pqObjectBuilder::createFilter, there is a properties parameter wich is suposed to allow programmer to pass properties to ther filter.
Yet it seems in pqSMAdaptor::FILE_LIST type property are taken in account :
  QMap<QString, QVariant>::const_iterator mapIter;
  for (mapIter = properties.begin(); mapIter != properties.end(); ++mapIter)
    {    
    QString propertyName = mapIter.key();
    QVariant propertyValue = mapIter.value();

    vtkSMProperty *prop=proxy->GetProperty(propertyName.toAscii().data());

    if(prop)
      {    
        switch (pqSMAdaptor::getPropertyType(prop))
        {
        case pqSMAdaptor::FILE_LIST:
          {
            pqSMAdaptor::setFileListProperty(prop, propertyValue.toStringList());
          }
          break;
        default:
          break;
        }
      }    
    }  

It would be grate to be able to pass parameter directly to the filter

Mathieu,

There isn't much difference between setting the properties in that function
call or you doing the same after that call. The method in pqObjectBUilder
is only meant to pass in filenames to the readers which need to happen
before any other changes on the proxy.

Kai,

Can you rebuilding with CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE set Debug and the attaching the
backtrace for the segfault? It's unclear why ParaViewPython::Run() would
segfault.

Utkarsh,


How do I attach the backtrace for the?segfault? I am pretty new to the Linux as well. Do I just do

$: gdb pvpython
$: run
on Ubuntu terminal to backtrace??

If that's not how we backtrace, can you please tell me how to do it? Thank you!

Kai L.?

Kai,

Once it segfaults, just type "bt" (enter) to pring the backtrace.

I?rebuilding with CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE set Debug. The following is the backtrace for the segfault



(gdb) run

Hi, thanks for your response.
Yes, I have tried it, and although useful for the statistics, like average
velocity magnitud, still does not allow
me to extract what I really need, like the sum of every mass*|V|^2 for all
particles as a function of time, and,
in general,  a global function (a function which depends on all the
particles) as function of time (array which
seems to be hidden).
Do you or anybody know if it is possible to configure the "Plot Selection
Over Time" filter to add it some
other function? or, is it possible to use the Python Calculator filter for
this? can someone share and example?
Thanks again for your kind response.

Message-ID: <F0BCF32C-2843-4EF2-8EE6-BEBEFFEE4D62@astro.wisc.edu>

Hi ?

Suppose I want to create a programmable source which draws a 3D (polygon) arrow between two user-specified points. Is there a way to leverage the already-existing arrow source to do this? Ideally, I?d like to take the polygons defined by the arrow source, adjust the vertex coordinates to position the arrow correctly, and return the result as the output of the programmable source. But I?ve not been able to figure out a sensible way to do this.

cheers,

Rich

Subject: [Paraview] Revisiting aliasing effect
Message-ID: <003001cf1d8f$3461b0a0$9d2511e0$@infovalley.net.my>

Hi, 

 

I'm a little confused regarding the inconsistent behavior of ParaView
(v4.x), specifically the quality of its volume rendering representation. The
Smart/GPU renderer for Windows version is slightly inferior to its RayCast
renderer counterpart whereas for the Unix/Linux version, it is kind of like
something you'd expect from a 'B' horror movie (see attachment for
Smart/GPU-based rendered images). It is mentioned here:
http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2011-June/022062.html &
http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2010-June/017961.html that
anti-aliasing (AA) is disabled by default. Then how could the Windows
(Windows 7, NVIDIA Quadro 600 + driver v320.xx) version persist to appear so
smooth despite setting NVIDIA's Control Panel AA handling to 'Off'?
Conversely, changing the same option in Linux (Ubuntu 12.04, NVIDIA Quadro
K5000 + driver v304.xx/v319.xx/v331.xx) to 'Override-application' adds
nothing to the quality. As of now, RayCasting is may not be a viable
solution since it induces substantial latency overhead.

 

Regards,

Den

Subject: [Paraview] pvserver Projected tetra
Message-ID: <CAKKV2Wvpx3AvQ-tEGXW7+-07jTv0DXCOjzTOMQjcatGzAi-22A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I have a problem using volume rendering with the "Projected tetra" mapper
in paraview client/server mode (4CPU server)

I start the server (it is linux sever with K20m teslas) using:

~/sw/ParaView-4.1.0-Linux-64bit/lib/paraview-4.1/mpiexec -np 4
~/sw/ParaView-4.1.0-Linux-64bit/lib/paraview-4.1/pvserver

... with that confuguratin the Projected tetra mappere prosuces only some
artifacts

But when I start the sever on just one CPU it renders (Projected tetra) OK:

~/sw/ParaView-4.1.0-Linux-64bit/bin/paraview


My settings in paraview client are:

"Remote Render Threshold"  On (0 Mbytes)


It could be replicated like this:

1. create Wavelet source
this volume renders (Smart mapper) OK in both server setups

2. convert it with Tetrahedralize filter
volume rendering of this (Projected tetra) with parallel server prduces
just some cells rednered as can be seen in the attached image.

images:
smart.jpeg ... Wavelet voleme rendered (Smart) with both server
configurations
projected_tetra.jjpeg ... tetrahedralized wavelet volume rendered
(Projected tetra) on 4 cpu server
both.jpeg ... the above results in one image

Is this an expected beahaviour? Or is some solution to this?

Thank you,

Martin

Evan,

You might want to take a look at the Resample With Dataset filter. One
of your meshes would be the Input and one would be the Source. What
this filter will do is sample the data values in the Input mesh at the
locations of points in the Source. If I understand the setup of your
meshes, this should essentially take care of the problem where your
point IDs are not the same. The result will be a single mesh with two
data arrays that you can then compare point by point.

You might run into a problem if both meshes use the same name for the
point array from which you want to get values (one will clobber the
other). You can take care of that by using the Calculator to rename
one of the mesh's arrays, then using the result of the calculator as
the Input or Source.

Hope that helps,
Cory

Hi Cory,

Thanks for the suggestion.  Resample With Dataset solves the problem of
matching up the Point IDs, but only passes data from the Input (which I
guess makes sense given its purpose), so I think regardless of what I
rename the arrays, the data will always be from only one of the meshes
meaning I can't use Calculator to compare the data.

I think my main obstacle is the data type.  Paraview reads in Ensight data
as a Multi-Block data set, but neither Append Datasets nor the Python
Calculator seem to work on that data type.  Is there a simple way to
convert them into a format that can be read by those filters?

Thanks,
Evan

How about using Append Attributes to combine the arrays of Resample
With Dataset and the Source?

You can use Merge Blocks to combine all the blocks in a Multi-Block
data set to an unstructured grid.

Best,
Cory

Message-ID: <EF8CEE69-2E98-4769-A612-849ABBC22762@astro.wisc.edu>

Hi folks ?

Can someone give me some pointers on how to set up texture mapping from within pvpython? I?d like to map a 2-D image (stored in a uniform rectilinear grid poly object) onto the surface of a sphere. Unfortunately, the docs are both brief and garbled (esp for the TextureMaptoSphere filter), and I really can?t figure out how to do this.

thanks,

Rich

Hello.

I do not reproduce this bug using PV 410 64 bits Linux or PV 410 32 bits 
Windows, both from binary installers.
Changing opacity through the slider is always OK with no pop up message.

Weiguang,

I suspect depth peeing (which is for the most part critical for
translucent rendering) doesn't work well with your graphics
card/drivers. Try upgrading your drivers. If that doesn't help, you
may have to disable depth peeling by unchecking the "Enable Depth
Peeling" checkbox on the Edit | Settings dialog's Render View page.
Note with depth peeling disabled, translucent polygons will not look
correct.

and if the driver update doesn't fix it for you it would be good to 
capture the issue in a bug report. so we have a better sense of which 
cards/drivers have issues with the algorithm.

Thanks a lot for the help.  I think Merge Blocks > Resample With Dataset >
Python Calculator (or Append Attributes > Calculator) allows me to do what
I originally asked for, although now I'm realizing the Python Calculator
may not be enough to do the calculations I want.  I had some questions
regarding the Python Calculator and the Programmable Filter:

1.  The data I'm looking at is from a transient simulation.  If I wanted to
standardize a parameter for each time step by dividing it by the standard
deviation of the population for that time point, am I understanding
correctly that I would either have to calculate the standard deviation
first and then manually type in the number into the Python Calculator or
use the Python Programmable Filter?

2.  Additionally, I've been looking around and it seems the only way to
perform a summing operation is to use the Programmable Filter.  Is that
correct?

3.  Regarding both the Python Calculator or Programmable Filter, is there
an easy way to tell which index corresponds to which input?  I thought
perhaps it had to do with just order you click the inputs in, but I'm not
so sure about that.

Thanks for your time,
Evan

Subject: [Paraview] Get Values of CSV sources with Programmable Filter
Message-ID: <C33B0F08-438C-4B53-AA89-DC6208E8B586@mac.com>

Hi all,


I'm using PV 4.1.0 and trying to get values of CSV sources with Programmable Filter.
It's better to get them as numpy.array.
How can I code it?
