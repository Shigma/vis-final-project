Subject: [Paraview] Press Apply Button from Toolbar
Message-ID: <49871407.3050502@gmx.net>

Hi everyone,

I wrote a toolbar plugin with a copy & paste function for filter 
pipelines. My toolbar button just copies the selected part of the 
pipeline to the selected source. Now I would like my filter to 
auto-press the apply button of every newly-created filter, is this 
possible somehow?

Thanks!

Does the Auto Accept toggle work for you?
It is under Options->General

pvserver should be creating windows on the xhost specified by the DISPLAY environment variable.  Are you sure that your xhost is properly accepting and showing windows?  What happens if you replace pvserver with a program like glxgears in the mpirun call you show below?  Do you see an OpenGL window on each of the displays?

Hi all,


We are trying to configure and run Paraview 3.4.0 on a tiled display with the following command:

mpirun -np 8 --mca btl ^openib,udapl --mca btl_tcp_if_exclude lo --hostfile /home/imagine/ParaView/hosts /bin/env DISPLAY=:0 ~/OpenFOAM/ThirdParty/ParaView3.3-cvs/platforms/linux64Gcc/bin/pvserver --server-port=1100 -tdx=1 -tdy=2

Then when we connect throught the paraview client it doesn't show in the two displays we requested.

So, is there a guideline or some kind of command/configuration we are missing so it can be displayed as wished?



Thnaks in advance.

Sorry, but that's not true at all.  It is in fact encouraged to have more processors than tiles when driving a tiled display.  All the processors, even the non-display ones, will be involved in the processing and parallel rendering work.

Hi Michael,

I think you need to look on:
- pqProxy::setModifiedState(ModifiedState modified);
- vtkSMProxy::Modified();
- vtkSMProperty::SetImmediateUpdate();

I did a similar copy/paste application but also you can 
copy and paste sources and readers on the root. I didn't 
try to add the auto-apply because some time the users 
wants to changes a value before applying.

I have a question: Is your copy/paste work on clip filter 
? I mean is the widget position copying working or the 
widget always reset it's position ?

I've had a similar problem on Fedora 10, but only when MPI support is
turned on and linking to openmpi-1.2.x (where x is 4 or 8). Carefully
uninstalling all vestiges of the nvidia drivers, re-installing just the
180.25 drivers, and building against openmpi-1.3.0 solved the problem.

I am not sure how critical the nvidia stuff was to the process but it's
something I did when I was looking into the issue -- I noticed that
NVidia's *.pkg.run script had put some libraries in a different
directory than the rpms from rpmfusion-nonfree and so both coexisted
(and might have caused problems where we linked to one but loaded the
other at runtime).

In any event the floating point exception seemed to be coming from the
openmpi-opal library's override of malloc.

	Hope this helps,
	David

David - I came to the same exact conclusion.     When I jumped to 
openMPI-1.3 I was able to get a clean build and execution.    Strange.

Subject: [Paraview] How to know the type of a selection ?
Message-ID: <821865.50293.qm@web110113.mail.gq1.yahoo.com>

Hi,



in programming of a plugin, I can get the ids of selected elements or
points through pqSelectionManager. I would like to process the
selection of cells and of points differently. The question is: how to
get the "type" of the selection, if it is a point or cell one ? I've
been looking at pqExtractSelectionsPanel, and it seems it only look at
the comboBox displayed in the Panel. How can I know this ?



Thanks all,

Rafael March.

First you'll need to locate the selection source proxy i.e. the proxy
that is producing the vtkSelection. Look at
pqSelectionManager::getIndices to see how to locate the selection
source. The selection source proxy will have a property named
"FieldType". That can be used to determine if it's a cell selection or
point selection. Values for this property are:
          <Entry value="0" text="CELL" />
          <Entry value="1" text="POINT" />
          <Entry value="2" text="FIELD" />
          <Entry value="3" text="VERTEX" />
          <Entry value="4" text="EDGE" />

Hi Moreland,

As i said when i tried running paraview on the tiled display with 6
procesors only everything worked right. I could see perfectly each model
loaded on Paraview on the Tiled Display, even glgears i tested and run
correctly on each screen. Now i corrected the Paraview's host file and it
looks like this.

192.168.51.136 slots=4
192.168.51.134 slots=4
192.168.51.132 slots=4
192.168.51.135 slots=4
192.168.51.133 slots=4
192.168.51.131 slots=4

Each of the six computers comforming the cluster has 4 slots available
meaning a total of 24 processors running in parallel. 192.168.51.136 is the
first screen, 192.168.51.134 the second and so on... When i run the command
with np 24 then the mapping on each screen is incorrect, as it 136 was no
longer associated with process 0 and so on. So at the end you see the model
but the correspondance between the tiles and process is incorrect. I don't
know if i am specifying wrong the arguments tdx and tdy as tdx=3 and tdy=2
and 3*2=6 which is different to 24...maybe there is something i am going
over which is causing the incorrect mapping.

One possibility is to create a custom panel with a timer which
periodically calls RequestInformation() to update the timesteps.

Hi,
  I haven't been following this thread too closely, but I think I might
see a problem.

  It appears the your hostfile is indicating that you wish to run four
processes per node.  When you launch with mpirun (I think you are using
OpenMPI) it appears there are 2 methods to match MPI process IDs to
machines in the hostfile, I don't know what is default.
 --byslot mpirun argument in your case will put the first 4 processes on 
192.168.51.136,
 --bynode will assign a round robin process 0 to 192.168.51.136, process 1
to 92.168.51.134 and so forth.

(according to a quick google)

I presume (perhaps incorrectly) that you have a graphics card in each node
and a 1 to 1 relationship of nodes to powerwall displays.
ParaView will map the displays linearly left to right top to bottom:

MPI process IDs will be mapped as so, by default, so make sure process 0
is on the node that goes to the top left, and process 5 goes to the bottom
right and everything else is mapped correctly in between:
___________________________________
|process0 | process 1 | process 2 |
-----------------------------------
|process3 | process 4 | process 5 |
-----------------------------------

Given that you have only 6 machines, presumably 6 graphics cards (??), and
6 displays, you might find that running a 6 process job (or as many
processes as you have graphics cards) is where you will get your best
performance.  That is run one paraview process per graphics card.  But
make sure the first 6 processes are aligned with your displays.

Hope this helps,
--John.

OK, if I understand correctly, you have 6 nodes with 4 processors per node.  You want to launch a job with 4 processes per node (one per processor).  When you do that, the first 4 processes are assigned to one node, and all try to create their own tile on the same node because ParaView assumes that you have arranged the first 6 processes on the display nodes.

Each implementation of MPI has its own way of specifying how to assign the processes in your job.  You have not said, but it looks like you are using OpenMPI.  You might want to try the -bynode flag to mpirun.  This flag is supposed to interleave the process allocation amongst nodes.  Thus, 136 should get process 0, 6, 12, and 18; 134 should get processes 1, 7, 13, and 19; and so on.

Hi Moreland,

As i said when i tried running paraview on the tiled display with 6 procesors only everything worked right. I could see perfectly each model loaded on Paraview on the Tiled Display, even glgears i tested and run correctly on each screen. Now i corrected the Paraview's host file and it looks like this.

192.168.51.136 slots=4
192.168.51.134 slots=4
192.168.51.132 slots=4
192.168.51.135 slots=4
192.168.51.133 slots=4
192.168.51.131 slots=4

Each of the six computers comforming the cluster has 4 slots available meaning a total of 24 processors running in parallel. 192.168.51.136 is the first screen, 192.168.51.134 the second and so on... When i run the command with np 24 then the mapping on each screen is incorrect, as it 136 was no longer associated with process 0 and so on. So at the end you see the model but the correspondance between the tiles and process is incorrect. I don't know if i am specifying wrong the arguments tdx and tdy as tdx=3 and tdy=2 and 3*2=6 which is different to 24...maybe there is something i am going over which is causing the incorrect mapping.

This is just speculation, but it could be an issue with multiple processes opening windows on the same graphics card.  My guess is that a non display process is drawing a window in front of the display process.

I often run multiple processes on each node in our visualization cluster for desktop delivery.  I get around the problem of X windows on top of each other by using the --use-offscreen-rendering flag.  I don't know how that flag will behave in tile display mode.  Ideally, it will make all the rendering windows offscreen except for the display windows.  If you have to make changes to ParaView to get that to work, it seems reasonable to push those back into ParaView proper.

Hi all,

Thank you very much for the tip on running mpi with --bynode option. We are nearer from a solution but it still bugging us.

The command is:

mpirun -bynode -np 24 --mca btl ^openib,udapl --mca btl_tcp_if_exclude lo --hostfile /home/imagine/ParaView/hosts /bin/env DISPLAY=:0 ~/OpenFOAM/ThirdParty/ParaView3.3-cvs/platforms/linux64Gcc/bin/pvserver --server-port=1100 -tdx=3 -tdy=2

Now, when we launch paraview the model is correctly positioned but not all the tiles show up. We have made several tests and it seems to be a random process as it turns some tiles on and off without reason. By the way we are using OpenMPI just as you said guys. This issue could be an OpenMPI problem or its a local cluster one? Could it be a problem when connecting paraview to the server? Even sometimes one of the cluster's machine stop responding which blocks paraview.

I have uploaded some screenshots pointing out the problem. The first image corresponds to a paraview run which only shows on 2 screens. The second one runs the same configuration as above but this time shows only on one screen. The last image corresponds when paraview blocks due to an unkonw (for the moment) network problem.

Message-ID: <45a0ee0d0902040130x1711d089qe16d7ab7dd6fd077@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I am newbie to Paraview and I want to ask you something. I am working with
signals and I use gnuplot for plotting. Unfortunately it's slow for big
signals. Our program is parallel so we can create files of many GBs. We do a
tricky parallel plot, every cpu plots a part of the signal, otherwise we
couldn't see the image from gnuplot (crash). So when I saw paraview I liked
a lot but it isn't easy.

I must explain what I want to plot:
We use a techinque in order to cut the points that haven't energy. For
example a specific signal with 12000 x 12000 mesh of points which is 8GB
file it can go under of 1GB if we cut the useless points. So I give at the
gnuplot only the points that I want to plot x,y,z and I use pm3d map because
I want them in 2D not 3D for example see the image:
http://www.markomanolis.com/files/plots/plot.jpg
I would like to ask. Is this unstructured grid? I show an easy signal it
could be with more random points. I have tried unstructured grid for 2
columns only and there is no surface between the columns. I used triangle
strip and it was ok but I don't know if I could see the details like here
(here I don't cut any useless point, in first image see wave details in the
center):    http://www.markomanolis.com/files/plots/62_0_0.jpg ,
http://www.markomanolis.com/files/plots/resFinal.jpg   .
Could I have these plots with paraview or it is good with more complicated
plots?
I must write a script/ program to convert gnuplot file to paraview but I am
not sure about the topology, I must declare the topolgy for every point,
right?  I am confused because I have a lot of constrains for example if a
point is alone then the topology is vertex if there is another point then
line etc... Is there any way to plot this grid with something like image
data. I want to give something like structured grid but NOT to give all the
points (I don't need them).  The last two images I sent you are with all the
points for education propose. I want to plot something like first image but
witho more complicated topology

Thank you for your time,
George Markomanolis

Subject: [Paraview]  Warning reading ascii data
Message-ID: <20090204101514.947A196@mach.vub.ac.be>

Hi,

I know paraview for nearly one week and I'm trying to make the best use of it.
I'm working on 2Dpropagating fronts and it seems that paraview can be very usefull for me. I already succeeded to visualize the 2D results but that is not my last project. I want to have a 3D pislay of it by putting the rounded values in the third dimension. It works nearly perfect. I can see my results as I want (display points and color by elevation) but I always have a warning message : 

Generic Warning: In /home/Arbaal/paraview/ParaView3/VTK/IO/vtkDataReader.cxx, line 1381
Error reading ascii data!

That is not a big probleme when I just look at one file at a time, but I'm looking to the temporal evolution of the fronts, and the warning appears for each display. What is my problem? Or how could I do to don't show this warning?

My matrix are large (smallest should be around 64*512 in 2D, I put 100points for my scalars) and my .vtk file looks like 

# vtk DataFile Version 2.0
headplace

My paraview version is the actual on CVS (3.5.0) and I work on Ubuntu (Unix-like)

If you have any idea on what is my problem, I'll be happy to hear it.

Thanks.

Hi,


is there anyone "outside", who has a reader in ParaView for the Centaur 
grid generator (www.centaursoft.com)?

Best regards,

     Stefan

Hi,

Well, we have tried with the off-screen option but it didn't work for us.
Strangely we checked the mpi output with the -display-map flag and
everything looks fine, the processes all look to be delivered where they are
supposed. Here is the output of that command:

Any idea why it doesn't work on all the tiles?

The Centaur docs say that it can write Ensight, which is something PV 
can read. Is that an option?

I don't profess to be an expert on the VTK file reader, but looking at the source code leads me to believe that the number of entries in one of the arrays in your file does not match the number identified above it.  Specifically, there are probably less entries than declared.  For example, in the example below perhaps there are less than 3309568  point coordinates listed.  Without seeing the whole file I cannot be sure.

Hi,

I know paraview for nearly one week and I'm trying to make the best use of it.
I'm working on 2Dpropagating fronts and it seems that paraview can be very usefull for me. I already succeeded to visualize the 2D results but that is not my last project. I want to have a 3D pislay of it by putting the rounded values in the third dimension. It works nearly perfect. I can see my results as I want (display points and color by elevation) but I always have a warning message :

Generic Warning: In /home/Arbaal/paraview/ParaView3/VTK/IO/vtkDataReader.cxx, line 1381
Error reading ascii data!

That is not a big probleme when I just look at one file at a time, but I'm looking to the temporal evolution of the fronts, and the warning appears for each display. What is my problem? Or how could I do to don't show this warning?

My matrix are large (smallest should be around 64*512 in 2D, I put 100points for my scalars) and my .vtk file looks like

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview on a tiled display

When you say the --use-offscreen-rendering flag does not work, can you be more specific?  Do you get the same response (some tiles shown, others not)?  Do you see no windows whatsoever?  Do you see a bunch of blank windows?

Hi,

Well, we have tried with the off-screen option but it didn't work for us. Strangely we checked the mpi output with the -display-map flag and everything looks fine, the processes all look to be delivered where they are supposed. Here is the output of that command:

Any idea why it doesn't work on all the tiles?

Subject: [Paraview] Trying to plot signals to paraview
In-Reply-To: <45a0ee0d0902040130x1711d089qe16d7ab7dd6fd077@mail.gmail.com>

ParaView is capable of reading in a regular grid of data, mapping a color to it, and drawing it scaled on the screen.  If your data is simply a raw array written to disk, then ParaView can read that in directly.  Does that basically solve your problem?

There are two ways to "erase" the useless points.  The first way is to simply set the color map up so that these values are simply drawn in the background color.  The second way is to use the "Threshold" filter to remove the uninteresting points.  The Threshold filter will convert the data from a regular array to an unstructured grid.  A warning about using Threshold though: the unstructured grid it converts data to is a less efficient representation so it is possible to actually require more data for the result if not a lot is removed.

Dear all,

I am newbie to Paraview and I want to ask you something. I am working with signals and I use gnuplot for plotting. Unfortunately it's slow for big signals. Our program is parallel so we can create files of many GBs. We do a tricky parallel plot, every cpu plots a part of the signal, otherwise we couldn't see the image from gnuplot (crash). So when I saw paraview I liked a lot but it isn't easy.

I must explain what I want to plot:
We use a techinque in order to cut the points that haven't energy. For example a specific signal with 12000 x 12000 mesh of points which is 8GB file it can go under of 1GB if we cut the useless points. So I give at the gnuplot only the points that I want to plot x,y,z and I use pm3d map because I want them in 2D not 3D for example see the image: http://www.markomanolis.com/files/plots/plot.jpg
I would like to ask. Is this unstructured grid? I show an easy signal it could be with more random points. I have tried unstructured grid for 2 columns only and there is no surface between the columns. I used triangle strip and it was ok but I don't know if I could see the details like here (here I don't cut any useless point, in first image see wave details in the center):    http://www.markomanolis.com/files/plots/62_0_0.jpg , http://www.markomanolis.com/files/plots/resFinal.jpg   .
Could I have these plots with paraview or it is good with more complicated plots?
I must write a script/ program to convert gnuplot file to paraview but I am not sure about the topology, I must declare the topolgy for every point, right?  I am confused because I have a lot of constrains for example if a point is alone then the topology is vertex if there is another point then line etc... Is there any way to plot this grid with something like image data. I want to give something like structured grid but NOT to give all the points (I don't need them).  The last two images I sent you are with all the points for education propose. I want to plot something like first image but witho more complicated topology

Thank you for your time,
George Markomanolis

Hi Burlen,
Thank you... removing 32bit of numa library worked.

Subject: [Paraview] Building on Leopard with Qt
Message-ID: <tNY-dopaOZBbEYXNLI3fZ-E5DdJXH_G7iO7kQx_nRNfptSOHN2W7eQ@cipher.nrlssc.navy.mil>

I thought I'd seen something on the mailing list a while back on this, 
but I can't seem to find it now.  I'm trying to build Paraview from 
source on OS X 10.5 but I get missing header errors, e.g.:

In file included from

It's PV 3.4.0 with Python and 64-bit ID's, Qt 4.3.5 built from source 
with no special options other than "-release", and XCode 3.0 w/gcc 
4.0.1.  Should I use a different version of Qt or XCode?

Dear Ken,

First of all thank you for your time. Unfortunately I don't want to save all
the data to the files. For example I must save (and load, plot) 8GB of full
image than 500mb If i "erase" useless points. I have no idea about the
duration to plot 8GB and 500mb at paraview but I believe it's big (general
the useless points are 85-95% of full image). I'll try of course to check it
but we've developed a technique to "erase" useless data and I believe that
it won't be accepted from the team except if it is fast with paraview. For
example with gnuplot in order to have good quality I save data to eps format
and after I convert it to jpg (plotting is done at the cluster and we
download only the jpg files) but the convert is very low, for example 500mb
may take 10-15 minutes to plot and save. I'll try to plot full image. For
unstructured grid I don't know how to declare topology, I believe I need
something like delaunay (triangulation) at matlab?

Thanks,
George Markomanolis

Can you post the actual build command for the file from the Xcode 
detailed display? I would say that there is a missing include path somehow.

Just for giggles, can you build paraview using Makefiles instead of Xcode?

George,

If you don't want to save the full image data, then either poly data or unstructured data is the way to go.  (Poly data will probably be a bit more efficient in ParaView, but either will work).

If you are looking for a format to store the data in, you might consider the VTK legacy data format.  This format is documented in the VTK User's manual and here: http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Image:VTK-File-Formats.pdf

As far as the topology is concerned, you have a couple of options.  One is just to define a bunch of "vertices" (0D cells).  These will just appear as points on the screen.  The advantage is that they are easy to specify: You just need coordinates and the data at that coordinate.  The disadvantage is that they are just drawn as a series of points.  You run the risk of holes appearing between the cells once the resolution of the data drops below the pixel level.  (That might not be a concern for you.)  The other option is to draw quadrilaterals either centered on each point or connecting 4 points.  The quads will make sure that the space is filled but require you to specify more connectivity information.  In either case, a Delaunay triangulation seems unnecessarily complicated.

There are two ways to "erase" the useless points.  The first way is to simply set the color map up so that these values are simply drawn in the background color.  The second way is to use the "Threshold" filter to remove the uninteresting points.  The Threshold filter will convert the data from a regular array to an unstructured grid.  A warning about using Threshold though: the unstructured grid it converts data to is a less efficient representation so it is possible to actually require more data for the result if not a lot is removed.

Oh, sorry for the misunderstanding.  I'm really more of a Linux guy, but
I'm building Paraview for some of my Mac users.  Anyway, I _am_ using
Makefiles.  It fails here:
[ 91%] Building CXX object Qt/Core/CMakeFiles/pqCore.dir/pq3DWidgetFactory.o

Would it help to post the verbose make output for this file?

Yes. Post the verbose for just that file.

  Also please post the following:

Hi Nathalie,

I have been working on this exact feature. If you are willing to build
and use the development version of ParaView, I can give you some
pointers on where to get started.
Are you loading the ParaView modules from a Python shell that already
has the data or are you loading the data from ParaView's Python shell?

Thanks.

Subject: [Paraview] Losing data when clip multi-block
References: <828FB228-A39F-4645-9FCC-682427C101E4@cs.duke.edu>
Message-ID: <CD123366-80D7-4DB5-BC3B-C5EAA0A45374@cs.duke.edu>

Hello,

I'm creating a multi-block data set using the group filter and then  
clipping it. The results of the clip are always missing one of the  
scalars associated with the second data set that I highlighted before  
applying the group filter. This only seems to happen if one of the  
data sets has multiple scalars or vectors associated with it -- if  
they each only have one, nothing is lost in the clip. (ParaView 3.4  
and CVS, OS X 10.5.6 and Windows XP 32-bit, no MPI)

I originally saw this with my own data, but I am able to easily  
replicate this by creating two point sources. I apply the Elevation  
filter to the first. Then, to the second I apply Brownian Vectors,  
plus a Calculator that computes the magnitude of those vectors. If I  
highlight Elevation and then Calculator, then Group and Clip, I lose  
the vector magnitude scalar at the Clip stage. If I highlight the  
Calculator and then the Elevation, then Group and Clip, I lose the  
elevation scalar.

Please let me know if anyone has any ideas about where this could be  
coming from.

Thanks a lot,
-Eric

Hmmm. Weird. We are using strtod to make the conversion from string to
double. That must somehow obey localization settings. Looking at here
http://www.mkssoftware.com/docs/man3/strtod.3.asp I see that we need
to somehow set the localization properly for the right radix. Should
we always set it to . ?

I would vote yes on that.  Although localization like this is good in a UI, it seems to be a pointless complicate to a data file in which people generally don't look at the contents.

A word of caution: If you are going to use ParaView in this mode, you
have to stick to the Python interface of ParaView. It is not possible
to start the GUI from Python. If you want to use the GUI, you need to
start the GUI and then load you Python module.script from the Python
console.

So, you have some arrays. What about the mesh? Is it defined by these
arrays? What do you mean by "plot these arrays"? Are you interested in
line charts only?

Hi,

Unfortunately the thread is pendig moderator approval for some photos to
upload so you could see better what the problem is. On the other hand, when
i use the *offscreen *flag i keep getting the same results as not having put
on the flag; tiles turn on and off randomly. On the ones that turn on it
shows the model correctly, the others simply don't display nothing and the
tiles go black.

Another option may be to use the hdf5 file format with compression on
to define the regular grid. I suspect that the Xdmf reader can handle
compressed hdf5 files. With compression, you should see a big
reduction in the size of the file if you are mapping the useless point
to the same value. The xml based VTK files also support compression so
that may be an option as well.

Hi, 

I have modified the vtkIntegrateAttributes to be a
vtkMultiBlockDataSetAlgorithm. 
Now I would like to have a histogram with the names of the blocks on the X
axis and the integrated variables on the Y axis.
Alternatively, I would like to be able to see the results for all the blocks
in the same spreadsheet view, but it seems to be impossible to select
multiple blocks for display in a spreadsheet. Is anyone working on a related
subject, or anyone has an idea on the way forward ?

I found that exporting the IntegrateAttributes results in the form of a 
vtkTable allowed me to display all in one spreadsheet. (names are used 
for the first column)

Same link as before.

Message-ID: <2DDC0446EF4690489771E0A9491C6305028AFDDA@EX3.d.ethz.ch>


Hallo,

I want to use some of special functions implemented in
http://www.alglib.net/ for my paraview filter. How should I change my
CmakeLists.txt and (maybe) server manager xml for that? ALGLIB doesn't
have any CmakeLists or makefile.

Is there any documentation on that? Or is there inverse of incomplete
regularized lower gamma function already implemented in VTK? I could
find it.

Thanks. Best,
Katya

In your plugin's CMakeLists file, use FIND_PATH and FIND_LIBRARY to
let the cmake user choose the include and lib directories for ALGLIB
respectively. Then use INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES and TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES
to let the compiler know about them.

Hi Paraviewers,
I am a new user of this tool and i would like to visualise MHA files downloaded from http://www.ucnia.org/softwaredata/5-tumordata/10-simtumordb.html using the PARAview tool.
So when i opened my MHA file and I chose the meta file format the image is not displayed.
I would like to know how to read these files using this tool.
Thanks in advance,

Best wishes.

I only downloaded TumorSimData_001.zip and only opened 
SimTumor001_Gad.mha, but it displayed fine for me.

What version of ParaView are you using?

Did you see only the white outline of the data?

This volume is big enough that my ParaView (I've messed with the 
configuration extensively.) shows me only the outline by default.

If you do see a white box after loading the data than you have a few 
options:

    I believe the default ParaView shows you a button along the top of 
the screen to contour the data.

    It also shows a button to change the representation of the data from 
outline to volume.

If you do not see the bounding box outline, and the contour button is
not pressable, make sure you have hit the Apply button on the
Properties tab of the Object Inspector Panel after choosing the
filename to open.

Message-ID: <EE35CDB51A4F8F40820C05C4D2EAF2B507D668@cf--amer001e--3.americas.sgi.com>

I download and I am running paraview 3.4.0.  I run pvserver on a linux cluster (where a .cas data file to visualize resides) andI run paraview on my Windows laptop.
 
First I tried running: pvserver --use-offscreen-rendering  on the server (which has gfx hardware) without setting
DISPLAY properly.  I got a message that the display was not accessible and that remote rendering would be
disabled.  I was still able to run paraview on the PC and connect to the server and display the model.
 
1) In this scenario, is any work at all being done by pvserver, other than providing access to the data file?
 
Next, I set DISPLAY to the gfx head on the server and reran: pvserver --use-offscreen-rendering.  I got no
messages this time and I again could connect to the server from the PC and display the model on the PC
inside paraview.
 
2. In this scenario, is remote rendering happening on the server?   How are things divided between the pvserver
and paraview in this case?
 
Finally, I tried running on a server with NO gfx hardware. I set DISPLAY to be the PC.  Again I could
connect and display the model inside paraview (on the PC)  but it runs very slowly.
 
3. What is the correct way to run pvserver on a server with no gfx hardware and have the server do rendering that is
then sent to the client?
 
 
Thanks

Yes. The server reads the file, and executes all of the filtering
operations, which may be extremely processor intensive. Think
arbitrary manipulation of large amounts of data. In the end the
surface extracts the polygonal surface geometry and sends that to the
client to display.

This server now does all of the above, and optionally renders the
polygons, producing pixels which are then depth composited and sent to
the client to display. I say optionally because if the geometry is

Message-ID: <13730207.1493991233864782777.JavaMail.www@wwinf4605>

Hi, 
first of all, thanks for your answer. 
For my MHA file, this is exactly the procedure used to open this file: 
- open the MHA file and choose the meta file format
- click on apply button then a white box appears
- click on contour and apply buttons and a volume appears as shown in the attached file.

The volume is not clear and I don't see the image normally. 
I would like to know are there parameters for adjusting or any thing else to see the volume and all slices of this volume. 

Note that I used default parameters and the version that I have downloaded is paraview-3.4.0-win32-x86. 

Thanks for your time.

Hi,
 
Thanks for the information.  Two quick follow-up questions.
 
In case 1 below (where the server reads the file and executes filtering operations but does
no rendering), is it worthwhile to do an mpirun pvserver in this mode?  Will the server do parallel work
in this case?
 
In case 2 below (where the server optionally renders the polygons), why is it necessary to set the
DISPLAY to the gfx head of the server (things are displayed on the PC) Why is the DISPLAY environment
needed at all for this off-screen rendering case?
 
Does mpirun also have an effect in this case?
 
Thanks again.

Yes. The server reads the file, and executes all of the filtering
operations, which may be extremely processor intensive. Think
arbitrary manipulation of large amounts of data. In the end the
surface extracts the polygonal surface geometry and sends that to the
client to display.

This server now does all of the above, and optionally renders the
polygons, producing pixels which are then depth composited and sent to
the client to display. I say optionally because if the geometry is
small enough paraview will simply send that rather than the pixels to
the client and render as above. "Small enough" is controlled via the
Preferences->Render View->Server->Remote Render threshold setting.

Yes. Consider doing something like contouring. Each of N processors
only has to iterate over only 1/N'th of the cells to contour, so you
can expect roughly Nx speedup. However, there are potential
bottlenecks, particularly in the reader code, which has to do disk IO
efficiently in the first place, and in more complicated filters
(streamlines).

Yes. When the data is large enough that paraview is shipping images to
the client instead of polygons, you have N processors that use their
own graphics cards to process only 1/N'th of the total number of
polygons. If the server is not running MPI, or the polygons are being
shipped to the client you have only 1 graphics card which has to scan
convert all N of the polygons.

Good day,

I'm a newbie in this big paraview world and I would like to know if there's
a way to do the following:

I'm trying to load a VRML 2.0 file using the following command:


myVRML=builder->createReader(QString("sources"),
QString("vrmlreader"),QStringList(temp), s);

Where temp contains the filename and s the pqServer.
The VRML is now shown in the pipeline browser BUT it is needed for me to
press by hand the "Accept" button in the correspondant Object Inspector.

The question is: is there any way to call that button by code? I haven't
found a way and its killing me.

Hope anyone can help me! It will be really appreciated,

... Juan Fernando Duque Lombana.

Try clicking on the Information tab in the Object Inspector panel. If
the data ranges are huge then there is probably an endianness
misalingment. If they look roughly OK, then the data probably loaded
alright and the problem becomes how do you look at what you've loaded
properly.

After the load, Click on the Display tab of the Object Inspector
Panel. Try changing the Representation to Surface With Edges. You
should see a box with lots of blue grids in it. The grids show the
individual cell boundaries. Now an attribute to color by. The interior
of the grids should be colored now instead of greyish white. Next
choose a Slice Representation. You can choose the slice axis and
offset from the Display Tab.

You need the DISPLAY environment variable because the standard way to get a gfx context on *nix is through an X server.  To create an off-screen rendering context you first have to connect to an X server.  It is also a convenient way to specify which GPU you want to use if a system has more than one.

There is one exception to the DISPLAY/X server requirement.  ParaView supports the use of OSMesa, which allows you to open a Mesa 3D rendering context without an X server.  This simplifies running pvserver a great deal, but works exclusively with software only rendering.  Thus, we recommend it if and only if you have no graphics hardware.

I don't know the answer to this question, but you may want to look at the code for the pqObjectInspectorWidget::accept() method.  This is the method that gets called when you hit the Apply button.

So in this case, pvserver is using the hardware GPU to render to an off-screen context?
 
It must also then be doing a pixel readback before it sends the image to the client?
 
On my server I have several proceesors and one gfx card.  If I do something like:
 
mpirun -np 4 pvserver --use-offscree-rendering
 
will each process create an off-screen rendering conext using the same gfx card?
 
In this case are the four images read back and combined before they are sent to the client?
 
Thanks for the answers.

You need the DISPLAY environment variable because the standard way to get a gfx context on *nix is through an X server.  To create an off-screen rendering context you first have to connect to an X server.  It is also a convenient way to specify which GPU you want to use if a system has more than one.

There is one exception to the DISPLAY/X server requirement.  ParaView supports the use of OSMesa, which allows you to open a Mesa 3D rendering context without an X server.  This simplifies running pvserver a great deal, but works exclusively with software only rendering.  Thus, we recommend it if and only if you have no graphics hardware.

I am afraid not. You can convert it to unstructured grid using
tetrahedralization and volume render that. Alternatively you can
resample it to a uniform rectilinear grid (image data). I can explain
how to do that if you want.

Subject: [Paraview] DICOM series reader for Paraview
Message-ID: <d0767b160902052036r383e12ecja35d6903709dafe4@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone.
I am wondering if anyone know how to integrate a ITK(GDCM) based DICOM
reader to Paraview?
My basic idea is:
1. Read DICOM series data through ITK(GDCM)
2. Export the data to a vtkImageImport class
3. Use the data in vtkImageImport as a source of Paraview
I have done the first two steps. But I am not sure how to do the third one.

I have read something about how to write a Paraview Reader in the Paraview
book. It is said that all the readers must derive from vtkAlgorithm or one
of its subclass. Fortunately, vtkImageImport is one of its subclass. So, I
guess it would be a good idea to choose vtkImageImport as a superclass of my
reader. Am I right?
If I choose vtkImageImport as a superclass, to make my reader works
properly, which methods should be implemented in my reader?

The last question is: How do I read the path to DICOM files from Paraview
Client GUI and pass it to my reader? For example, the DICOM data is stored
in /usr/DATA/ directory, how can I pass this value to my reader?

Thanks very much for your help!

Subject: [Paraview] Question on distributed processing and rendering using
 Paraview and MPI
Message-ID: <SNT106-W17C97FCB8B4F7BA283D7CAABC10@phx.gbl>


Hi,
 
My name is chewping and I?m doing my master?s research in the University of Malaya, Malaysia. I?m using ParaView and MPI to visualize a relatively large medical data set in a homogeneous cluster environment. It consists of one master node and 9 slave nodes in a Local Area Network with class C IP address. Most nodes are similar to each other (32 bits processor, running on Linux). I would like to manipulate MPI to make the performance better (faster distributions of data and collections of results). As I am new to MPI and parallel processing system, there are a few questions that I would like to ask:
 
1.      How MPI distribute the work load?
2.      Does the master node divide the work load evenly first, then distribute to each slave node?
3.      Or the master node pass the whole chunk of work load to every slave node, then the slave node ?take? their own piece of work to process?
4.      Can the work load being distributed according to priority (load balancing)? Or give a bigger portion of work load to the node with higher processing speed?
 
Can MPI do the above and how? Where can I learn more on how to use MPI to tune for best performance for distributed processing and rendering?
 
Thanks in advance for your feedback!

Hi,

if you intend to use a DICOM reader in Paraview, why not using
directly GDCM, instead of ITK? It contains a VTK Reader... If I am
right, you will just have to write the XML/CMake files that make the
reader available in Paraview.

In my case, I use the vtkDICOMImageReader, that is a very simple dcm
file series reader: just give the folder containing the files, and let
it read. If you need more functionalities, the GDCM reader will do the
trick.

You can find a later version of GDCM than the ITK integrated one, on
this website: http://www.creatis.insa-lyon.fr/Public/Gdcm/ . I cannot
help you more, as I had never use it for now.

Cheers,
Jerome

Hi,


Is it possible to change the default representation of a given 
(existing) data type?

I would like to set the default representation of vtkImageData to slice.

Thanks

Bryn,

It's not possible to change the default representation. However, it's
possible by wiring a plugin to do the same, would that help?

Eric,

Does the loss of arrays happen even if you clip the orginal dataset by
itself (without grouping it using the group filter)?

Hi Utkarsh

Thanks for the answer. I had a look at the wikipage (Adding a new 
Representation), but it seemed too complicated for a small issue like this.

Oh no, don't need to add a new representation. You'll create a new
autostart plugin
(http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Plugin_HowTo#Autostart_Plugins). In this
plugin you'll have to create a new subclass for  pqDisplayPolicy and
then set it on the application core as follows:

pqApplicationCore::instance()->setDisplayPolicy(mypolicy);

In your pqDisplayPolicy subclass you can override the behaviour for
creating representations when a new source is created.

Hey Utkarsh,

No, I've never seen the clip lose data on one dataset by itself.

The other interesting thing is that I can't always get this data loss  
to happen if the data was generated as part of a source from the  
Sources menu. It's much more likely to disappear when the data was  
generated by a filter or brought in by a reader.

For example, if you generate a Box and a Wavelet source, grouping and  
clipping them won't lose any data, but if you run Generate IDs on one  
of them, then select GenerateIds1 second before grouping, then clip,  
the "Ids" point data disappears...

Thanks,
-Eric

Eric et al,

I recently had a problem where a filter opreated normally when used 
normally, but when someone put a calculator in front of it, it stopped 
working. The filter in question instantiated other filters internally.

I tracked to the problem down to this.

Calculator calls SetActiveScalars(New data)
another filter later does a PointData()->PassData(blah)
->SetActiveScalars(More New data)

And the New data from before was lost. I do not like this 
SetActiveScalars function because it replaces (not adds) whatever scalar 
was there before. I cnaged the offending filter (in this case 
vtkSurfaceVectors) on my copy to do
PointData()->PassData(blah)
PointData()->AddArray(newData);
PointData()->SetActiveScalars(newData->GetName())

or something like that (from memory).

I have no idea if this is related to your problem, but I just thought 
I'd vent my spleen and start a campaigh to remove this 
SetActiveScalars(...) call as it is just rubbish. (At least it should be 
modified internally to not remove the old active slalars if they are are 
about to be wiped)

One way you could simplify this is to use a "dual grid". Instead of 
thinking about your data as point centered think of it as cell centered 
where the data represents a constant value on a quad centered on your 
point.  Then once you construct a list of i,j indices for data that you 
want to keep, traverse the list and generate a point set and quads. Then 
copy the data you need to keep in the same order as you created your 
quads and insert into the vtk poly data object as cell data rather than 
point data. This will give you the same result as the gnu plot image you 
show and you won't have to worry about degenerate cases like isolated 
vertices, and lines etc.

Subject: [Paraview] Question on distributed processing and rendering
 using Paraview and MPI
In-Reply-To: <SNT106-W17C97FCB8B4F7BA283D7CAABC10@phx.gbl>

Chewping,

Let me start with a nomenclature normalization.  What you call master/slave nodes we call client/server nodes.  We make this distinction because the client needs to be nowhere near the server nodes (I have attached a client to a server running on the other side of the country).

Your question is difficult to answer succinctly because it depends on the type of data.  In general, load balancing does not happen through MPI but through file I/O.  The parallel readers in ParaView each read in a partition of data, and that partition is fixed to the process.  For structured types of data (data with a regular grid topology), this partitioning can be very even.  For unstructured data, the partitioning is usually limited to how the data is lain out in the data files, so even partitioning is not guaranteed.  There is a filter, D3, that will use MPI to redistribute an unstructured data set.  No data is passed through the client in this process.

For more information, you can consult The ParaView Guide, which has a couple of chapters on parallel processing and rendering: http://www.kitware.com/products/books.html

You may also take a look at the Supercomputing tutorial, which talks about the parallel visualization from a User's perspective: http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/SC08_ParaView_Tutorial

Hi,



My name is chewping and I'm doing my master's research in the University of Malaya, Malaysia. I'm using ParaView and MPI to visualize a relatively large medical data set in a homogeneous cluster environment. It consists of one master node and 9 slave nodes in a Local Area Network with class C IP address. Most nodes are similar to each other (32 bits processor, running on Linux). I would like to manipulate MPI to make the performance better (faster distributions of data and collections of results). As I am new to MPI and parallel processing system, there are a few questions that I would like to ask:



1.      How MPI distribute the work load?

2.      Does the master node divide the work load evenly first, then distribute to each slave node?

3.      Or the master node pass the whole chunk of work load to every slave node, then the slave node 'take' their own piece of work to process?

4.      Can the work load being distributed according to priority (load balancing)? Or give a bigger portion of work load to the node with higher processing speed?



Can MPI do the above and how? Where can I learn more on how to use MPI to tune for best performance for distributed processing and rendering?



Thanks in advance for your feedback!

Subject: [Paraview] xdmf polydata-points (particles)
Message-ID: <498C64A3.7060805@gmx.de>

Hi,

I am using xdmf-file-format for my structured grid to visualise
turbulent flows.

Now, I have a bunch of vectors not connected to that grid, but defined
somewhere between the grid-points. They are stored as float-XYZ
+xyzLength in my hdf5-file (you could think of particles with
attributes,too.)

Therefore I need to add polydata-points+attributes to my xdmf-file. Is
that possible? And if yes, how?

Greetings
Jens

Message-ID: <A0D249F2-9C6C-40DA-9890-9A4483A1B107@cs.duke.edu>

Hello,

I'm having trouble creating vtkImageData with the Python Programmable  
Source. The PolyData Helix example works fine for me, but when I try  
to create ImageData it seems to build the data structure within Python  
(i.e. I can print the characteristics of the ImageData and it looks  
fine in the Output Messages), but no data shows in the Information tab  
or the 3d render view.

Here's the simplest case of the things I've tried (after selecting  
vtkImageData from the combo box):

pdo = self.GetImageDataOutput()
pdo.SetDimensions(10,10,10)
pdo.SetOrigin(0,0,0)
pdo.SetSpacing(1,1,1)
print pdo

I can add scalars to it, or create a new vtkImageData and then shallow  
or deep copy that over to the output, and those things look like  
they're working fine at the print statement, but they don't seem to  
help get the data to really show up in the pipeline.

I hope someone can just point out something I'm forgetting to do...

I've seen a bug before where the output data type is fixed at the
first apply. If you did something like this it might explain what you
are seeing:
output type = polydata
enter python code to populate the image data
apply
change output type to image data
apply

See if this fixes the problem:
save the code somewhere (like the clip board)
delete the source
set output type = image data
past in python code
apply

Hey Jens,

I think it should work out fine to treat them as "particles with  
attributes". Here's an example of a short time series of particles  
which each have XYZ positions, plus a scalar and a vector attribute.

Hi Eric,

Subject: [Paraview] vtk file format too strikt
Message-ID: <498C78FC.4080702@gmx.de>

Hi,

the following file _cannot_ be read by paraview 3.4.0:

#vtk DataFile Version 2.0
Detailed
ASCII
DATASET POLYDATA
POINTS 1 float
-0.00168334 0.0751933 -0.000422686

but with adding one space it is fine:
# vtk DataFile Version 2.0
Detailed
ASCII
DATASET POLYDATA
POINTS 1 float
-0.00168334 0.0751933 -0.000422686

I think paraview-readershould not behave that strikt.

Greetings
Jens

Eric,
I was trying to replicate this bug, and cannot.   Please give me detailed instructions on how to replicate it, and I will put it in the bug tracker.  Better yet would be you putting it in the bug tracker.

I tried:
ParaView CVS trunk from late January, XP, non client/server.
Source/Box
Source/Wavelet
(Highlight Box) Filters/ Generate Ids  
(Highlight GenerateId and Wavelet) Filters/ Group Datasets
Clip
I then see the Ids points data as follows: Ids (partial)

Subject: Re: [Paraview] Losing data when clip multi-block

Hey Utkarsh,

No, I've never seen the clip lose data on one dataset by itself.

The other interesting thing is that I can't always get this data loss to happen if the data was generated as part of a source from the Sources menu. It's much more likely to disappear when the data was generated by a filter or brought in by a reader.

For example, if you generate a Box and a Wavelet source, grouping and clipping them won't lose any data, but if you run Generate IDs on one of them, then select GenerateIds1 second before grouping, then clip, the "Ids" point data disappears...

Thanks,
-Eric

Hey David,

Thanks, but that doesn't do it for me. Even if I set the output data  
type before ever hitting Apply, it has the same outcome.

Hey Alan,

Are you seeing both the point and cell Ids arrays? When I do this I  
end up with only the cell Ids array -- the points one is missing.

Here's another one that loses a data array consistently:

Create a Point Source (100 pts, 10 radius)
Apply Elevation filter to points
Create a Sphere Source
Apply Curvature filter to sphere
Select Elevation then Curvature
Group
Clip
Gauss_Curvature is missing in Clip Information (only see Elevation &  
Normals)
(or, after deleting clip and group filters)
Select Curvature then Elevation
Group
Clip
Elevation is missing in Clip Information (only see Gauss_Curvature &  
Normals)

Any luck with that one? (I'd just like to hear that someone can  
reproduce the problem before I file a bug report...)

Thanks,
-Eric

No (maybe someone else knows).  You may try to just replicate the method.  The accept operation is not tied to any particular pipeline object; it simultaneously updates all of them.

Using the following code:

pqPipelineSource* myVRML;
myVRML=builder->createReader(QString("sources"),
QString("vrmlreader"),QStringList(temp), myServer);
myVRML->getProxy()->UpdateVTKObjects();
myVRML->setModifiedState(pqProxy::UNMODIFIED);

The "Accept" button acts as if it is pressed! (not green anymore :) )

In the render view, the object is not shown, BUT if i go to the object
inspector in the GUI and press in the Display tab the Visible checkbox, the
object is shown. Does anyone know how I can do that via c++ ?

Hi Johannes,

This is currently not possible. In the future, the collaboration
framework that we are working on may allow this. Currently, you have
to use the built-in Python console. I would love to see that console
support rich interactive functionality like ipython but I am not sure
how to go about implementing that. Any suggestions are welcome.

Thank you for the answer, I'll try it. Till now I hadn't good result with
plotting just the points.

Hi,

I'm pretty new in ParaView and when trying to use the filter
ParticleTracer I get an error message saying:

ERROR: In
/Users/kitware/Berk/ParaView3/VTK/Filtering/vtkDemandDrivenPipeline.cxx,
line 722
vtkCompositeDataPipeline (0x217c7fb0): Input port 1 of algorithm
vtkTemporalStreamTracer(0x1e345e00) has 0 connections but is not optional.

I've been looking for information on this and a found a thread which I
think concerns the same problem. In that thread Berk made a patch to fix
this problem.
I also tried to ignore pipeline time, but this doent work. I'm working
with .case files and I want to animate the blood flow in a human heart
using particle tracers. I'm using a Mac with ParaView version 3.4.0.

Thanks for looking into this.

Cheers,

Martin Uppman

Input 0 should be a time dependent dataset. It is best to use a 
TemporalCache before the particle tracer to stop multiple updates for 
the same time step. Input 1 should be some seed points.

Ensight -> TemporalCache      ->
                                 ParticleTracer
Some Other data eg.line/plane ->

the ignore pipeline time option is provided to get around some animation 
issues that used to plague paraview. You should not need it, but the 
correct way to use it, is set  IgnorePipelineTime to true, then set an 
animation keyframe to animate TimeStep from 0->N - the particle tracer 
will then use the timestep to generate update times for the Ensight 
input, instead of usigin the GUI generated time.

If you are using the particle tracer from prior to 3.4 then you should 
switch to a newer one as it is contiunually being improved. I will soon 
(months, not days) be checking in a lot of changes which enable it to 
handle dynamic meshes better.

Subject: [Paraview] Filter Plugin in Client/Server ParaView
Message-ID: <425263.73573.qm@web110108.mail.gq1.yahoo.com>

Hi,

I've finished recently to program a ParaView filter. I developed it under windows, and now I want to run it in a distributed environment: a client running in a windows machine, and a server running in a SGI Cluster. 

I thought it should work, 'cause i've programmed following the paraview client server architecture (using server manager properties, and so on). But when I open paraview (I can see my plugin loaded in "Local Plugins" in the Plugin Manager dialog), and try to use my filter, it crashes and close. 

The question is: do I have to load my plugin as a "Remote Plugin", or it is enough to generate my dll under windows and load it as a local plugin ? Must I compile it under linux and load it in the Cluster ? Or maybe this is just a programming bug ?

Regards,
Rafael March.

Finally I solved my problem.
The lines of code I used are as follows:

pqPipelineSource* myVRML;
myVRML=builder->createReader(QString("sources"),
QString("vrmlreader"),QStringList(temp), myServer);
myVRML->getProxy()->UpdateVTKObjects();
myVRML->setModifiedState(pqProxy::UNMODIFIED);
pqOutputPort* opPort = myBox->getOutputPort(0);
pqActiveView& myActiveView=pqActiveView::instance();
pqApplicationCore::instance()->getDisplayPolicy()->setRepresentationVisibility(opPort,myActiveView.current(),true);

With this I finally changed the status of my reader (Accept button not green
anymore) and rendered the object on the active view!
It works with filters as well,

:)

Thanks for your support

If your filter has any C++ code (and by your description it does) then you will have to compile the plugin on the SGI Cluster and load it there.  As a general rule, it is usually safest to compile the plugin for both client and server and load it both places.

Hi,

I've finished recently to program a ParaView filter. I developed it under windows, and now I want to run it in a distributed environment: a client running in a windows machine, and a server running in a SGI Cluster.

I thought it should work, 'cause i've programmed following the paraview client server architecture (using server manager properties, and so on). But when I open paraview (I can see my plugin loaded in "Local Plugins" in the Plugin Manager dialog), and try to use my filter, it crashes and close.

The question is: do I have to load my plugin as a "Remote Plugin", or it is enough to generate my dll under windows and load it as a local plugin ? Must I compile it under linux and load it in the Cluster ? Or maybe this is just a programming bug ?

Regards,
Rafael March.

The settings for LOD threshold and default color maps are stored in the user's settings file (~/.config/ParaView/ParaView3.X.ini on *nix machines).  You could try installing a default version of the settings file for your in-house distribution.  Another solution is to hack the defaults in the code.  Perhaps someone on the mailing list has a better solution.

I know of no way to change the default edge color (short of changing it in the code, of course).  I could not find a feature request for it either, so I created one.

Thanks for your help, Jerome.
I find the vtkGdcmReader files in the latest GDCM package. After I build
these files as a Paraview Plug-in and load it, I got this error message from
Paraview console:
ERROR: In
/usr/scratch/bshe/Paraview/ParaView-3.4.0/Servers/Common/vtkProcessModule.cxx,
line 1079
vtkProcessModule (0x8a7c2e0): Cannot create object of type "vtkGdcmReader".
while processing
Message 0 = New

line 1080
vtkProcessModule (0x8a7c2e0): Aborting execution for debugging purposes.
I must do something wrong, but when I build the vtkGdcmReader, no error
message at all. Here is my CMakeLists file:
FIND_PACKAGE(ParaView REQUIRED)
INCLUDE(${PARAVIEW_USE_FILE})

FIND_PACKAGE (GDCM)
IF (GDCM_FOUND)
   INCLUDE(${GDCM_USE_FILE})
ENDIF (GDCM_FOUND)

ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN(vtkGDCMReader "1.0" GUI_RESOURCE_FILES pqReader.xml)
ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN(vtkGDCMReader "1.0" SERVER_MANAGER_XML reader.xml)

You also mentioned that you use vtkDICOMImageReader as your DICOM reader in
Paraview. It seems that I can only use the reader to read one DICOM image
file. How can I write the XML files for vtkDICOMImageReader to read a series
of DICOM files? Could you please email me your XML files for
vtkDICOMImageReader if possible? Thanks very much!

Message-ID: <d0767b160902091533k7532827dkf9abf80c4838c59b@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Utkarsh.
I read your post at
http://markmail.org/message/iswwagv2ejsybjhy#query:paraview%20dicom+page:2+mid:6ex4hkecehwma6t2+state:results
I am currently trying to integrate a DICOM reader to Paraview. The first
problem I met is how to pass a directory name to a paraview reader.
You mentioned that "I just committed a feature to CVS where if the
<UseDirectoryName /> hint is present on the filename property, the directory
name will be used instead of the file name" in your post. I am wondering if
this feature is avaliable in the latest stable verison of Paraview (3.4.0).
I tried the XML code you provided in the latest stable version. It doesn't
work for me. The vtkDICOMReader still only read one DICOM file.
Here is my server side XML files:
<ServerManagerConfiguration>
  <ProxyGroup name="sources">
   <SourceProxy name="DICOMReader"
                class="vtkDICOMImageReader"
                label="DICOM reader">
     <Documentation
       short_help="Read DICOM files."
       long_help="Read DICOM files.">
       The DICOM reader reads DICOM files.
     </Documentation>
     <StringVectorProperty name="Directory"
                            command="SetDirectory"
                            number_of_elements="1">
     <FileListDomain name="files"/>
     <Hints>
         <UseDirectoryName />
     </Hints>
   </StringVectorProperty>
   <!-- End PNGReader -->
   </SourceProxy>
  </ProxyGroup>
</ServerManagerConfiguration>

Maybe I did thing in a wrong way? Thanks very much for your help!

Hi again,

thank you for fast answer John! I'm aware of the problem that my particle
tracer doesnt have any seed source, but I have been working for quite
awhile sloving this problem. I did as you said, created temporalcache and
seed (point seed) but I cant connect the 2 with my particle tracer. I
found your (John's) great powerpoint presentation on the web explaining
everything there is to explain. Though I cant make it work!!! In one of
the pictures in the presentation there are some boxes where you can choose
which sources to use in the particle tracer (in object inspector ->
properties -> source). I dont have that option in my program. Does someone
know why (using v3.4.0 on a Mac)?
About v3.4.0, isnt it the lastest version? Cant fint anything newer on
paraview.org.

Cheers,

Martin Uppman

I have a python programmable source which mimics an already working C++
Reader. The Reader works in parallel and correctly gets the Update
Extent assigning to each proc, a different sub-region of the whole. The
Python prog. source works fine in serial mode.

When run in parallel, *all* procs receive the same Update Extent equal
to the Whole Extent, as if the Extent Translator ignores the
parallelism. I get the following printed for the Update Extent:

Process id: 0 >> (0, 63, 0, 31, 0, 24)
Process id: 3 >> (0, 63, 0, 31, 0, 24)
Process id: 2 >> (0, 63, 0, 31, 0, 24)
Process id: 1 >> (0, 63, 0, 31, 0, 24)

Have other been successful with Programmable Source running in parallel?

My script is atached.

Hi,

This is weird. I followed the same post as you, and it works for me,
in the stable 3.4 and in the CVS 3.5 (nightly). As the
vtkDICOMImageReader does not make use of DICOMDIR, but only dcm type
files, are you this is not a problem in your dcm files? I think that
they have to contains the information of slice indices. If they don't,
the reader 'think' that there is only one file in the list...

I will check your xml on my system. You didn't mention the CMake file:
what about?

regards,

Jerome

This is a "feature" rather than a bug. The programmable source sets
the extent translator to be a vtkOnePieceExtentTranslator. To override
this behavior, add the following to your RequestInformations script:

from paraview import util
self.GetExecutive().SetExtentTranslator(self.GetExecutive().GetOutputInformation(0),
vtk.vtkExtentTranslator())

The thought never crossed my mind this could be a bug, but it sure
defied my understanding of parallelism. Made me doubt for a while.

As per the motivation of the ParaView developpers to do that, besides
providing an exercise for the more adventurous folks?

N.B. I added the code in my Update Script, not in the RequestInformation
Script as suggested, because it would cause the server to crash. (PV 3.4.0)

Thanks for the tip.

Subject: [Paraview] [ParaView3-Developer] Locking (MPI?) problems with
	ParaView 3.5

John,

Here's my understanding of what may be happening:
* pvclient has done a gather data information and is waiting to
receive that data
* pvserver0 has received this "gather data" request is asking all
satellites to gather data
* pvserver1 also received that "gather data" request but before is
starts processing it, pv1 needs to pass on the message to it's "child"
i.e process 3 (this is the fancy tree based message communication that
we are now using. So now, instead of the root node sending the message
to all processes one after the other, it uses a tree structure).
* pvserver2 I believe is happily waiting for the next message. It
already processed the "gather data" request, sent the response to the
root (although root has not processed that response yet) and now is
waiting for  the next request.
* pvserver3 is the rogue. It's stuck in "Cancel", hence it won't
receive any messages other send to it. This cancel was not done as a
part of this gather data request but was done at the end of some
previous request. Thus it's not yet able to receive the "gather data"
request pvserver1 is trying to send, consequently freezing pvserver1.

Of course, this is just one possible explanation. I've attached a
patch. Can you please test if this overcomes the issue. If not, you
may also want to try by connecting the "Cancel" out all together. That
will at the least help us narrow down the problem.

Hi,

I use 3 files for the vtkDICOMImageReader plugin :

- One CMakeList.txt where you can find those lines:

# READERS PLUGIN --------------------------------------------------

  # Use the ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN macro to build a plugin
 ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN(
   DICOMImageReader          #<--Name for the plugin
  "1.0"                        #<--Version string
   SERVER_MANAGER_XML DICOMReader.xml  #<-- server manager xml
   GUI_RESOURCE_FILES DICOMReaderGUI.xml
 )
#------------------------------------------------------------------

You can also use this file for other ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN command

- One DICOMReaderGUI.xml
- One DICOMReader.xml

Both latter are given.

Regarding the GDCMReader, I am sorry I could not help you. As I said,
I had never tried this lib in a Paraview framework. The best you can
do - well, the laziest in fact - is to ask the GDCM development team
to give a built-in paraview plugin.

Today, the vtkDICOMImageReader is sufficient for me, and what I give
here makes it works in ParaView 3.4 stable and nightly CVS 3.5, both
Windows (XP and Vista) and Linux (Fedora 9). This is true when the
plugin is loaded on the computer that built Paraview. Other problems
arise when deploying on 'pure-of-devel-stuff' systems.

I hope this will help.

Best regards,

Jerome

Utkarsh

Looks good. 10 out of 10 successes with the patch applied (using 5 to 10 
pvserver nodes) - I'll try with more later when the rest of the machine 
is free.

Thanks yet again for your help. If the problem comes back in another 
flavour I'll be sure to let you know.

This was left from the days when charts expected rectilinear grid
input. Consider the case where you are applying a programmable filter
to an unstructured grid which computed a histogram. In that case, you
don't want to produce a portion of the output in each process but
rather produce the whole output and accumulate the result somehow.
Since we now use tables for charts, that can probably go away. I will
think a bit more before I remove it.

Is there anyway to build paraview using an existing VTK installation
instead of having to have another copy of VTK inside paraview?

Possible to do, but your life is too short to make it worthwhile. 
Instead, Build paraview as per usual, and stop using vtk on its own!
Simply point your projects to
/my/path/to/paraview/build/VTK
and they will pick up the VTK config from there.

John, 

Thanks a lot for your help. I have re-used part of your code to create a
Multi-block to table filter. (Basically exactly the same as your
probeIntegration but without the integration step).
The problem I have now is in creating a histogram which has the Block Id
(String - first column of data in my vtkTable) on the x axis and the data on
the y axis. 
It seems that the histogram plotting capability in ParaView can not handle
String Ids instead of numbers.

- Has anyone implemented such capability ? 

- What is the best way to access the vtkTable object through Python directly
(to then possibly use some python plotting facility)?

- Is it possible to create an image (Jpg, png etc..) from Python of an XY
plot or a Bar Chart ?

The new charts in vtk/guisupport/qt/chart have support for strings and numbers on the axes. The old charts only support numbers. We're currently integrating the new charts into paraview. Then, you'll be able to view the vtkTable.

The chart views in vtk/guisupport/qt can be displayed using python. There are some tests you can use as an example (I can't remember where they are at the moment). I'm not sure how well that will work in paraview though. It may have to be done stand-alone.

Thanks very much, Jerome.
The vtkDICOMReader works right now. The problem was in my xml file for
server manager.
Again, thanks very much. I am really appreciate your help!

Eric,

I think we dealt with this problem since 3.4. I can't reproduce the
problem with your first set of instructions on cvs head. Do you mind
trying the cvs version?

It should be something like:

from paraview import util
util.SetOutputWholeExtent(self, [0, 10, 0, 10, 0, 10])

Make sure that you are putting this in the RequestInformation script.
I think in the future, we should have a widget with six entry boxes...

Eric,
Sorry for taking time to get back to you - I wanted to verify with the developers that this isn't expected behavior.  You have correctly found a bug. 

I wrote this up as bug number 8494 in the Kitware bug tracker.  I used your very simple, excellent Point and Sphere source example listed below.  If I missed anything, please feel free to modify the bug appropriately.

Alan

That works great -- thanks!

Now that you pointed me in the right direction, I can see how both  
WholeExtent and UpdateExtent were [0, -1, 0, -1, 0, -1]  in the output  
with my original script. Maybe it should have been obvious, but I  
didn't know enough to look for that.

It also seems to work fine if I set these in the main script:

pdo.SetWholeExtent(0,9,0,9,0,9)
pdo.SetUpdateExtentToWholeExtent()

Thanks again,
-Eric

Thanks a lot, Alan. This was driving me nuts that nobody could  
reproduce it! :)

For now I wish I could predict which variable was going to be lost so  
I could at least create a sacrificial array that could disappear and  
leave my real data intact.

I also wish I knew the difference in Berk's build that won't reproduce  
my first example since I still see the data loss on today's CVS. I'm  
trying an MPI build in case there would be a difference in how multi- 
block data sets are handled, but I know that's probably grasping at  
straws...

Anyway, thanks for filing the bug and I'll take a look at it later to  
see if I can add anything.

Talk to you later,
-Eric

Subject: [Paraview] How to change the default mapper for 3d volume rendering?
Message-ID: <d0767b160902101321g4dcb83e1x2474f60c83c56052@mail.gmail.com>

Thanks to this mailing list, I know how to make Paraview read the DICOM
files right now.
However, the volume rendering speed is not satisfactory. I am wondering if I
want to use vtkOpenGLVolumeTextureMapper3d for the volume rendering, how
should I change paraview's code? Moreover, if I want to use my own GPU-based
volume rendering algorithm in Paraview, how should I do it? Or is that
possible?

Thanks very much!

I have a plugin that adds toolbar actions.  From one of these actions I want to be able to open a dialog box to browse files on the server.  From within the plugin action, how do I get the active pqServer to point to the right connection?

As an added bonus, how do I get a reference to the main window so that the dialog boxes have an appropriate parent?

Thanks you, I can now conenct the two sources. I tried on Windows and
found this alternative if I want to use "input" or "source" in the
particle tracer. When choosing "source" I could select both dataset and
seed source. Problem on my Mac was that the dialog box was to small so I
didnt find this option.

Btw what is the difference between vtkTemporalDataSet and vktDataSet?
ParticleTracer requires vktDataSet which I dont have, is it possible to
convert the dataset somehow.
I can use filter StreamTracer on my dataset and because StreamTracer and
ParticleTracer is based on the same physics, I should be able to visualize
particles.


ERROR: In
/Users/kitware/Berk/ParaView3/VTK/Filtering/vtkDemandDrivenPipeline.cxx,
line 822
vtkCompositeDataPipeline (0x225e2020): Input for connection index 0 on
input port index 1 for algorithm vtkTemporalStreamTracer(0x225e20b0) is of
type vtkMultiBlockDataSet, but a vtkDataSet is required.


Cheers,

Martin Uppman

Subject: [Paraview]  measure of distance between two points
Message-ID: <fac5e9bb0902110047n7e948273u3c5e88c597ad87fb@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I have been searching for help in the previous posts, but I couldn't find an
answer, even if the question has already been asked (
http://www.mail-archive.com/paraview at paraview.org/msg00990.html):
Is there a way in ParaView to measure a distance between two nodes (with a
result that could then be displayed in the spreadsheet view, why not)?

I thank you in advance for your help.
Regards,

Pierre

The new charts in vtk/guisupport/qt/chart have support for strings and
numbers on the axes. The old charts only support numbers. We're currently
integrating the new charts into paraview. Then, you'll be able to view the
vtkTable.

The chart views in vtk/guisupport/qt can be displayed using python. There
are some tests you can use as an example (I can't remember where they are at
the moment). I'm not sure how well that will work in paraview though. It may
have to be done stand-alone.

John, 

Thanks a lot for your help. I have re-used part of your code to create a
Multi-block to table filter. (Basically exactly the same as your
probeIntegration but without the integration step).
The problem I have now is in creating a histogram which has the Block Id
(String - first column of data in my vtkTable) on the x axis and the data on
the y axis. 
It seems that the histogram plotting capability in ParaView can not handle
String Ids instead of numbers.

- Has anyone implemented such capability ? 

- What is the best way to access the vtkTable object through Python directly
(to then possibly use some python plotting facility)?

- Is it possible to create an image (Jpg, png etc..) from Python of an XY
plot or a Bar Chart ?

Hi,

to get the active server, look a this example:

pqServer* PrismCore::getActiveServer() const
{
   pqApplicationCore* core = 
pqApplicationCore::instance();
   pqServerManagerSelection sels = 
*core->getSelectionModel()->selectedItems();
   pqPipelineSource* source = 0;
   pqServer* server=0;
   pqOutputPort* outputPort=0;
   pqServerManagerModelItem* item = 0;
   pqServerManagerSelection::ConstIterator iter = 
sels.begin();

   item = *iter;
   source = dynamic_cast<pqPipelineSource*>(item);
  
   if(source)
     {
     server = source->getServer();
     }
   else
     {
     outputPort=dynamic_cast<pqOutputPort*>(item);
     if(outputPort)
       {
       server= outputPort->getServer();
       }
     else
       {
       server = dynamic_cast<pqServer*>(item);
       }
     }
   return server;
}

You need at least a pqServerManagerModelItem to use this 
way.
I don't know why pqActiveServer::current() is not static !

Then use pqFileDialog with the current server:

pqFileDialog::pqFileDialog(
     pqServer* server,
     QWidget* p,
     const QString& title,
     const QString& startDirectory,
     const QString& nameFilter);

Pat had some python code to test the chart python wrapping, but it doesn't look like it's in cvs. The api should be similar to c++ though. You can look at vtk/guisupport/qt/testing/cxx/TestVtkBarChartView.cxx as an example. You'll just have to convert it to python calls and import the right modules. I haven't played with vtk python, so I'm not sure what module the views show up in.

Yes and no. You can measure the distance between two points using the
ruler source. Currently, the value cannot be display in the
spreadsheet. We should probably change the source to produce a single
value in a table. Feel free to post a feature request at
http://paraview.org/Bug

ps. You can select the position of the two end points by using the 'p'
key while inside the 3D view.

Subject: [Paraview] Getting proxy names from proxy manager.
Message-ID: <16d926890902111329y391e386btc2039e311c6783c5@mail.gmail.com>

Using the following c++ code:

myBox=builder->createSource("sources", "CubeSource", s);
myBox->rename(QString("VWTBoundary"));
myBox->setModifiedState(pqProxy::UNMODIFIED);
pqOutputPort* opPort = myBox->getOutputPort(0);
builder->createDataRepresentation(opPort,myActiveView.current());

I've been able to create an unitary box named in my pipeline "VWTBoundary" .

Using the following code:

       vtkSMProxyManager *pxm = vtkSMProxyManager::GetProxyManager();
       cout << "RUNNING" << endl;
       unsigned int nproxies=pxm->GetNumberOfProxies("sources");
        cout << "Nproxies: " << nproxies << endl;
        for(unsigned int i =0; i < nproxies; i++)
        {
                vtkSMProxy *proxy = pxm->GetProxy("sources",i);
                cout << pxm->GetProxyName("sources",i) << endl;
        }
        cout << "FINNISHING"<< endl;

I'm suppously able to get the proxy names of the group "sources".

The question is as follows:

When I generate a single box, the code works flawlessly. When I have 2
proxies with the same name on the pipeline, the code doesn't seems to finish
(I never get the last cout output).
Any Ideas?

Thanks in advance!

Hi Berk,

Thanks. That is actually perfect!
The spreadsheet idea was just because I was too much in a
pipeline/filter-like thinking mode (with outputs absolutely availabe for
future re-use).

Just an additional question: is there a way to have some kind of magnetism
with already displayed existing nodes (maybe available with a box to
activate or not)?
That is to say, when grabing one of the node with the mouse and moving it,
having a control of its position with respect to the position of other
displayed existing node, and if coming close to one, gluing it to this close
one.

If not, I may add a feature request.

Regards,

Pierre

Hi Pei-Ying,

You may want to try ParaView Meshless
(https://twiki.cscs.ch/twiki/bin/view/ParaViewMeshless). It is a
version of ParaView with the cutting edge of John Biddiscombe's
particle tracking work in it. Some of those features will be/have been
integrated into the main paraview code, but I can not vouch for when
that will happen.

cheers,
Dave DeMarle

Subject: [Paraview] Program to write .VTK
Message-ID: <704f8f370902120029t6b757abey8a131395c13f5cab@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everybody,

I'm searching for a program to write some .DAT files in .VTK format. (for *
Paraview* visualization)

These .DATs contains grid structure(bathymetry), lat, long,  scalars and
vectors. I'm writing them *manually* in .VTK, like these:

# vtk DataFile Version 3.0
vtk output
ASCII
DATASET STRUCTURED_POINTS
*DIMENSIONS 387 312 1 *
SPACING 1 1 1
ORIGIN 0 0 0
*POINT_DATA 120744  *
SCALARS batimetria float
*LOOKUP_TABLE default
0.0000000e+000  0.0000000e+000  0.0000000e+000  0.0000000e+000
0.0000000e+000...
0.0000000e+000  0.0000000e+000  0.0000000e+000  0.0000000e+000
0.0000000e+000...*
...


The DAT files holds the grid (bathymetry), then I spent lots of time copying
and pasting the grid from .DAT to *LOOKUP_TABLE default*, and writing
the *dimensions
and point data* of each file...

Since I'm working with large time data-steps files, I would like to known if
anybody use or recommend a program to speed up this process.

Thanks a lot,

Renan.

Subject: [Paraview] [newbie] Animating time-series MFIX data
Message-ID: <4993F8E3.9080409@lunartech.org>

Hi all,

Please excuse my "newbie" question - I'm a new ParaVIEW user this week. 
I have a time-series dataset generated from the MFIX CFD code that I 
want to visualise. I have no problem loading and displaying the data.

I can generate an isosurface, for example, and animate such that the 
isosurface value changes over time. But I cannot seem to animate over 
the time series data (e.g. for a constant isosurface value).

For example if I change the Time Step slider in the Object Inspector and 
apply, the view updates to reflect the data at that time step. However 
if I add an animation track (Cell Arrays) the display does not update 
during the anim.

Hopefully this is a simple newbie question :) Thanks in advance for your 
help,

Regards,

Mark

I don't think this answers Pei's question. To my knowledge the
temporal stream tracer (i.e. particle tracker) works only for
time-dependent data. Am I wrong? To animate particles in a
steady-state flow field, I'd think that you would generate streamlines
and then somehow animate particles along those. I can't think of
anything that would do this out-of-box but writing a  filter that does
this would be pretty easy. Is this something more than a few users
would want?

Actually, this seems to be a bug in the reader. Creating the contour
and then hitting play should just work. I tested and it does not. We
will look into it.

this is exactly the technique I use. Generate streamlines. Then
iso-contour the streamline object with the scalar field
"IntegrationTime". Use a single threshold. Then animate the threshold
value. Use Mode=Sequence, get a ramp between minimum time and maximun time.
Use Glyphs (small spheres or arrows) attached to the iso-valued contours
and they will "animate" their position along the streamlines.

Interesting. I guess the biggest challenge of doing this in our
pipeline would be finding the time range. Ideally, the integration
should continue until all particles leave the domain or get stuck in a
stagnant region. That would require integrating them first and then
looking at the largest integration time.

While I was writing this, Jean's response showed up. It is pretty
ingenious :-) This is why I love ParaView. It allows you to do things
in ways developers did not foresee.

Subject: [Paraview] Why is PKdTree used for IMAGE Volume Rendering?
Message-ID: <1234465788.13296.44.camel@gargon.hooperlab>

I just tried to use ParaView from Tuesday's CVS (The network was down
last night.) on both CPU cores to volume render a large (1/4 the size of
available RAM) image.

As soon as I selected volume render for the representation I saw the
status bar show PKdTree and moments later all of the system memory was
consumed and the system started swapping.

I had to kill paraview and the pvserver processes from the console to
end the swap-death.

I reran paraview with only one CPU core and proceeded as normal.

My question is: why is PKdTree needed at all for image data?

For unstructured data it of course makes sense but for image data it
just wastes a lot of RAM.

I haven't tried parallel image volume rendering in a while so I don't
know when this showed up.

Do you have any unstructured data being rendering in  the scene?
KdTree is used to distribute that unstructured data in accordance with
the partitions provided by the structured data.

No, just one big .vti image.

Kevin,

The KdTree is still built (using the partitions from the structured
dataset set itself -- hence isn't a very compute intensive task) just
in case it's needed to partition any unstructured data, hence you're
seeing the PKdTree progress. But I don't think that's where it is
hanging. Is the progress bar saying PKtree:100 ? It may actually have
frozen in the volume rendering code. Is it possible to attach a
debugger to any of the server processes and see where it's stuck
(provide the stack trace if possible)?

No, it only made it to 58

Ah and there's the bad news.
In case of image data for the "if" condition at vtkPKdTree.cxx:435,
I'd expect the condition to succeed and go to
this->ProcessUserDefinedCuts(..) however, it seems like that condition
is failing and it's going to this->MultiProcessBuildLocator(..) which
is used for unstructured datasets.

Are you able to reproduce the behavior with a simpler dataset (say
wavelet) or something that;s already in ParaViewData, or some dataset
that I can try it with? Also give me all the steps to reproduce the
problem (since I am not able to reproduce it with 5 procs using
Wavelet source).

this is exactly the technique I use. Generate streamlines. Then
iso-contour the streamline object with the scalar field
"IntegrationTime". Use a single threshold. Then animate the threshold
value. Use Mode=Sequence, get a ramp between minimum time and maximun time.
Use Glyphs (small spheres or arrows) attached to the iso-valued contours
and they will "animate" their position along the streamlines.

This conversation has basically become academic, but it would also be pretty easy to create a filter that reported a bunch of time steps and just passed the same data every time.  The particle tracer would thing it was a time varying data even though it was not.

Jean's solution is still easier (and more clever), though.

Interesting. I guess the biggest challenge of doing this in our
pipeline would be finding the time range. Ideally, the integration
should continue until all particles leave the domain or get stuck in a
stagnant region. That would require integrating them first and then
looking at the largest integration time.

While I was writing this, Jean's response showed up. It is pretty
ingenious :-) This is why I love ParaView. It allows you to do things
in ways developers did not foresee.

Subject: [Paraview] Losing data when clip multi-block

Hey All,

I'm not sure if John has it exactly right, but he may not be that far  
off...

I was working today on a variant of the Clip filter which would not  
remove coincident points, and somehow in my ServerManger XML I ended  
up always exposing the Scalars input combo-box (which is used as input  
to vtkClipDataSet::SetInputArrayToProcess()) no matter whether I was  
clipping by plane, box, sphere or scalars. By default, vtkClipDataSet  
uses the active scalars on the first input for this array -- but using  
this combo box I could control this input even though I wasn't really  
"using" it (because I was clipping with a box or a plane).

The clip filter always keeps all the scalars from the block which  
contains the input to SetInputArrayToProcess(). The filter loses data  
from the other block, and it always seems to be the most recent array  
added to that data set -- i.e. the one which should be the "active  
scalars" in that block. This agrees with the behavior seen in my other  
examples in which the "second" data set highlighted before the Group  
filter is the one that loses a data array -- the active scalars of the  
first selected block are probably the ones being used for  
SetInputArrayToProcess().

I can't track it down to the type of SetActiveScalars() without a call  
to AddArray() that John is talking about, but it seems related since  
it is the "active" scalars that are getting lost.

If you think this is intelligible at all, I can add it to the bug  
report.

Talk to you later,
-Eric

Yes, I was able to reproduce the problem with the wavelet source data.
and I got a new datum as well.

It seems I have to load the large image from a .vti file for the error
to occur.

The error does not occur when I create a large image in parallel with
the wavelet source.

In paraview connected to the builtin server I created a wavelet source
with extents 0 1958 0 1498 0 77 to match my file.

I then saved that to a vti file.

I then restarted paraview and started a 2 core server that the dialog
runs with 

	mpirun -np 2 \
		/home/kevin/kitware/ParaView3_Build/bin/pvserver \
		--use-offscreen-rendering

I loaded the image then selected volume rendering for the
representation.

Then BLAMO swap-death.

Kevin,

Attached is a patch. Can you verify that it works after applying the
patch? If so, I'll commit it to CVS.

Thanks

Yup that fixed it. The PKdTree completes immediately and then I get my
volume rendering.

Sorry, but this doesnt make any sense to me. I have a 3D dataset with
magnitude and velocity (X,Y,Z) for 13 time frames. And as you wrote,
paraview internally converts multiple vktDataSets into a TemporalDataSet.
But particle tracer requires multiple time steps, why does it then give
error that a vktDataSet is required? A  vktDataSet, according to what you
wrote, is just a single timestep.

That's great!  I've been wondering how to animate streamlines.

Hello,

I think there is some bugs in clip filter and probably 
other similar filters. (using proxy Properties)

1 - create a box source, apply a clip on it using a plane, 
save the state, disconnect or close paraview, load the 
state, try to change the clip type to box for example, no 
Box ! ( sometimes it works )

2- create a box source, apply a clip on it using a plane,
change the clip type to box and apply, continue changing 
the clip type and applying like more than 10 time, you 
will see that every time you change the clip type and 
apply, it takes longer to load, and finally it will crashe 
paraview.

Subject: [Paraview] Mesh edition / modification with paraview
Message-ID: <49959B24.1080409@free.fr>

Hello,

Paraview is very well known in the data visualisation area.

However, I'd like to know whether it is possible to write a plugin able 
to modify a mesh, for instance to move a selected point of a mesh.
By extension, would it be possible to use paraview (with a new plugin) 
to edit a structured orthogonal mesh in order to add/remove an edge, a 
face or an element (a cube) ?

Thanks a lot,

Cyril Giraudon.

Message-ID: <b02264720902130832x729fen6f5d53a202576178@mail.gmail.com>

I have a 2D Triangulated mesh that a user wants extruded into a 3D Shape for
use in simulation work.

I tried using the "Linear Extrusion" filter, but that only gets the outer
edges.  What I really need to do is extrude the triangles into 3D
Triangulate Prisms (5-sided solids, 2 triangles & 3 quads).  Is there any
way to do this?

I tried doing:
Dataset
 |- Extract Surface - Linear Extrusion
 |- Extract Edges - Linear Extrusion
Append both Together - Clean

That's close, but I have a collection of 2D Primitives, and lose all the
interior volume.

You can do the following:

1. start with original surface (original triangles), with N nodes

2. extrude by a certain distance: you get a new surface (new triangles)

3. the extrusion simply adds corresponding nodes for each original  
node, so a node with id k has a corresponding node with id N+k.

4. connect triangle i in original triangles with triangle i in new  
triangles. Make a prism for each triangle.

5. convert all prisms to tetrahedra using "triangulate"


Most of the code necessary for this can be found here (steps 1-4, 5 is  
already in paraview):

Maybe a bug in the Mesa implementation? Or somehow a mismatch between
OpenGL libraries? Can you try to compile the latest Mesa from source
and use that?

I finally have an answer for this. You first export the custom proxy
to an xml file. Then you do:

servermanager.ProxyManager().LoadCustomProxyDefinitions("<filename here>")
servermanager.updateModules()

After this, you can create your custom proxy like any other proxy:

custom_filter = servermanager.filters.Foo()

Nehme,
I believe that the Box source is not a good test case.  The box source was described to me as a 2d skin of very large polygons.  I tested your examples listed below on the disk_out_ref dataset, and clip by box, sphere, etc worked fine. 

I have replicated this bug, and it has been reported as ParaView bug number 8533.  Good catch!

Alan

Hello,

I think there is some bugs in clip filter and probably other similar filters. (using proxy Properties)

1 - create a box source, apply a clip on it using a plane, save the state, disconnect or close paraview, load the state, try to change the clip type to box for example, no Box ! ( sometimes it works )

2- create a box source, apply a clip on it using a plane, change the clip type to box and apply, continue changing the clip type and applying like more than 10 time, you will see that every time you change the clip type and apply, it takes longer to load, and finally it will crashe paraview.

you could do it with the python programmable filter in paraview.

Yes.

ParaView stores data in vtkDataSets, and each filter in ParaView takes
in one or more vtkDataSets, looks at them, and produces one or more
vtkDataSets (often by shallow copying the inputs).

If you understand the vtkDataSet and vtkAlgorithm API's well enough,
the operations you describe are fairly easy to accomplish. (See the
python programmable filter wiki page for examples).

However, providing a good UI that lets the user control which parts of
the DataSet geometry and topology are modified is not altogether
trivial. That would probably require significant use of vtkWidgets to
create the visual editing tools, ParaView's Proxy/Property pattern to
map the tools behavior over to the server side filter properties, and
how ParaView's QT ObjectPanel interfaces exposes properties in the
client application.

Hi John,

the error messages about Multiblock Dataset is showing when I dont use a
temporal cache on my input. I tried using just a line source for seed
points and I dont get any errors about that. So the problem is: If I just
use particletracer on my input and line soure I get error saying Dataset
is Multiblock Dataset which is not required. If a use a temporal cache on
my input and then make a line source as seed points and connecting the two
using the particletracer, it gives error saying dataset is TemporalDataset
which is not required.
I dont have any idea have to come around this problem. Is there another
way to follow 3d flow in a good manner? I've tried streamtracer but dont
think you get a clear view.

ERROR: In
/Users/kitware/Berk/ParaView3/VTK/Filtering/vtkDemandDrivenPipeline.cxx,
line 822
vtkCompositeDataPipeline (0x1ff6cd60): Input for connection index 0 on
input port index 1 for algorithm vtkTemporalStreamTracer(0x1ff6cdf0) is of
type vtkTemporalDataSet, but a vtkDataSet is required.


Cheers,

Martin Uppman

Thanks David for your answer,

Can the output of a filter be the input once modified and without a copy ?
(I don't want to create a new vtkDataSet each time an operation is executed)

I'd like to handle a huge amount of data (1000^3 cubes minimum), is the
IO operation can be a problem for the save to disk task of the mesh ?

Cheers,

Cyril.

Hi,
I have 2 .vtu files containing scalar data and I would like to combine them to one vector.
Probably I will have to use the Calculator with 
something like firstfile.value0*iHat + secondfile.value0*jHat
But I don't know how to access the value0 of the 2 files.
Does anyone know this ? 
Thanks in advance for your help!

1. Seleect two files in the pipeline and apply filter "Append Attributes" (I
think name of the variables in two files should be different!)
2. Then you will see your two different variables within "Scalars" in
"Calculator"

Good luck!

I wonder if it is my own built (Linux box), or if something else is
broken. I cannot do anything useful with the Octree Fractal source. I
get crashes for most every action I try: selection of cells, or points,
via the render window, or inside a Spreadsheet view. Octree Depth
Scalars or Octree Depth Limit both cause a segmentation fault.

Makes it difficult to debug my own reader since I cannot get the source
example provided to work.

Note that all ctest pass, with PV3.4 or PV CVS:

 73/908 Testing TestClipHyperOctree              Passed
 78/908 Testing TestHyperOctreeContourFilter     Passed
 79/908 Testing TestHyperOctreeCutter            Passed

137/908 Testing HyperScalarBarPython             Passed

What's the trick?

Subject: [Paraview] probing issues
Message-ID: <49999123.5050101@cscs.ch>

I have two vtkImageData (one source, one input for the Probe Filter)

DatasetOne (the probe source) has extents [0,31,0,31,0,31] and has one
scalar field
DatasetTwo (the probe input)  has extents [-15,16, -15,16, -15, 16] and
has no PointData or CellData

I am running into several problems:

"Resample with dataset" cannot be connected to DatasetTwo because it is
checking that the Input dataset has a data array to sample. This seems
to be the opposite of what should be enforced. It is the Source dataset
which should be checked for the existence of DataArrays to sample.

Fine, one can get around this and select the Source object, instantiate
a Probe, revert the pre-assigned role of Source being used as Input. So,
I set the source object to be DatasetOne, the input object to be
DatasetTwo. Click apply and the error is:

ERROR: In
/local/apps/ParaView-3.4.0/VTK/Filtering/vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline.cxx,
line 704

vtkCompositeDataPipeline (0x1755b60): The update extent specified in the
information for output port 0 on algorithm
vtkPythonProgrammableFilter(0x17549e0) is 0 31 0 31 0 31, which is
outside the whole extent -15 16 -15 16 -15 16.


What is happening is that the Update Extent of the Source object is
propagated to the Input object, which cannot satisfy the request because
its WholeExtent is outside the range.

That does not seem right to me. One should be able to probe any dataset
with any source, regardless of their relative UpdateExtents. Right or wrong?

I've included a script to replicate this: use "ProbeSource" as Source,
and ProbeInput as Input. Click Apply.

Message-ID: <fb2577d80902161422m49e9cdf2rf619178083123525@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

Using a plugin I can create a point source with the following code:

  pqApplicationCore* core = pqApplicationCore::instance();
  pqObjectBuilder* builder = core->getObjectBuilder();
  pqServerManagerModel* sm = core->getServerManagerModel();
  pqServerManagerSelectionModel* sms = core->getSelectionModel();
  pqServer *activeServer = sm->getItemAtIndex<pqServer*>(0);

  pqPipelineSource *newSource = builder->createSource("sources",
                "PointSource", activeServer);

I would like to add a vtkStringArray to the server side of this
source. From the server side,
I can easly do it using:
vtkPolyData::GetPointData()->AddArray("my vtkStringArray");

How can I do the same from the client side, using the pqPipelineSource
that I created ?

Thank you.

Subject: [Paraview] Problems running a test case
Message-ID: <COL109-W79E5F983D694E8AF0070FA6B40@phx.gbl>


Hi All,



I am very new to paraview (so please excuse my ignorance when asking
this question) and I want to use a recorded test case to produce an
image snapshot. I have recorded a test case using the Tools -> Record Test and in this test case I load in a state file, adjust some of the view settings and then save an image snapshot. Recording the test case file (which I called first.xml) seems to work well. However, when I play the file everything works right up until the point at which the image snapshot should be taken and I get a message in an output window which states: Couldn't find object "MainWindow/FileSaveScreenshotDialog" and then on the next line: Found up to "MainWindow". It then stops, so that I need to press the OK button on the Save Snap Shot dialogue box to continue. I have to do this manually whereas I want the xml file to automatically do this.

I have tried both recording and running the test case on two different linux machines (one running Ubuntu and the other SuSe) and I get the same problem on both. I am using the 64bit binary version of paraview 3.4.0. Is there something obvious that I am missing?. Any tips, suggestions or references to what I could try to fix this would be most appreciated.

The listing of the first.xml file is as follows:

<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<pqevents>
  <pqevent object="MainWindow/menubar/menuFile" command="activate" arguments="actionFileLoadServerState" />
  <pqevent object="MainWindow/FileLoadServerStateDialog" command="filesSelected" arguments="/home/preichl/PARAVIEW/first.pvsm" />

No, it can't. VTK is designed such that filters never change their
input. Otherwise, the demand-driven pipeline paradigm breaks down.

You can write a custom application based on VTK or ParaView that does
not use the pipeline and can allow editing of meshes in place.
However, this would probably take some significant amount of work.
Another issue you would encounter is that VTK data structures are
designed to be efficient in memory usage and time to setup but not for
quick editing. This follows the demand-driven pipeline design.

My recommendation would probably be to use VTK/ParaView in conjunction
with another library that provides good support for mesh editing.

Best,

I fixed the two octree filters. Selection seems to crash due to a bug
in the octree class and it is probably not that easy to fix. Please
submit a bug report.

There's no easy way for doing that from the client side. Changing
output data objects outside of a filter/source is not recommended,
it's better to add those inside the filter/source's  RequestData().
Try creating a custom source instead.

Good day,

I've been looking inside paraview sourcecode and yet I haven't been able to
find how could I get a list of all the instanced pipelines inside a server,
any hint on that?

Thanks in advance

Hi,
Creating custom source will solve my problem.

Thanks Utkarsh.

Subject: [Paraview] xdmf: JOIN() to create vector-field
Message-ID: <499AEF82.8060804@gmx.de>

Hi,

I am using xdmf for scalar fields until now. To create a vector-field
from my scalars I use the paraview calculator.

but I read that creating a vector with 3 scalars should be possible
directly in the xdmf-file.

I tried this, but it fails in paraview 3.4.0

<Attribute Active="1" Type="Vector" Center="Node" Name="gnorm">
  <DataItem ItemType="Function" Function="JOIN($0, $1, $2)">
     <DataItem ItemType="Uniform" Format="HDF"
       NumberType="Float" Precision="8" Dimensions
       &DataFile;:/g/data/ngx
     </DataItem>
     <DataItem ItemType="Uniform" Format="HDF"
       NumberType="Float" Precision="8" Dimensions
       &DataFile;:/g/data/ngy
     </DataItem>
     <DataItem ItemType="Uniform" Format="HDF"
       NumberType="Float" Precision="8" Dimensions
       &DataFile;:/g/data/ngz
     </DataItem>
  </DataItem>
</Attribute>

Any idea what I am doing wrong?

Greetings
Jens

Jens,

Did the XML for the inner XML get truncated (look at
the dangling "Dimensions"). Also you might need
"Dimensions" in the function DataItem.

Message-ID: <16d926890902171327q4e0e9f65r9f8d3f8423c56013@mail.gmail.com>

Good day everyone,

Does anyone knows how to extract the "Transform" matrix from a Transform
filter?

I've been trying using the following line:

vtkSMDoubleVectorProperty *Transform_prop =
vtkSMDoubleVectorProperty::SafeDownCast(myFilterPipeline->getProxy()->GetProperty("Transform"));


But when I try to access any:

Transform_prop->GetElement(i);

I get a segmentation fault,

Any hints or ideas?

Thank you in advance!

Hallo everybody,

I am working now for quite a while with xdmf, which I find a very good  
tool. I now tried to process compressed (CHUNK, GZIP) h5 data, and  
paraview keeps crashing with a 'segmentation fault'. Has anybody some  
idea about that, or yet tried to process compressed data? Any hint is  
appreciated.

Many Thanks

The "Transform" property is a vtkSMProxyProperty. Use GetProxy(0) to
get the actual source proxy that produces the transform while is the
("extended_sources", "Transform3") proxy. It does not have API to
access the transform directly, however. You can only get the
scale/translation/rotation values.

Dear all,


We have compiled paraview server  with  MPICH2 and parastation ,   when
we deploy the server  , it starts with no troubles , the clients
connects  easily as well .

However , when  we do some calculations , like a contour,   it takes
much more time (~3x)    to represent the surfaces   as  when  using the
client  alone


Another thing that bothers us,  when I start the client  with  vglrun 
(through vglconnect  )   We get this warning :
[VGL] ERROR: Cannot obtain a Pbuffer-enabled 24-bit FB config on the

Can I checkout the paraview data from the CVS?  There is only a link to the
zipped up data on the website.  I want to get all the tests running on my
system....

Hello,

Does anyone know an easy way to extract all cells of a particular type from
an unstructured grid (without writing code either a plugin or python
script)?  I was thinking it be possible with the calculator and the number
of points in a cell but I can't get access to that.

Thank you Utkarsh!

I used a property iterator to get the names of the properties you suggested;
Finally with this lines of code I was able to get the information I needed:

 vtkSMProxyProperty *Transform_prop =
vtkSMProxyProperty::SafeDownCast(myFilters[0]->getProxy()->GetProperty("Transform"));

 vtkSMProxy* myTransformProxy=Transform_prop->GetProxy(0);
 vtkSMDoubleVectorProperty *Position_prop =
vtkSMDoubleVectorProperty::SafeDownCast(myTransformProxy->GetProperty("Position"));

 vtkSMDoubleVectorProperty *Rotation_prop =
vtkSMDoubleVectorProperty::SafeDownCast(myTransformProxy->GetProperty("Rotation"));

Thank you!

Paul,

I don't know of any existing filter to do that, but a pretty simple programmable filter can do it.  Here is the script that will achieve it.  Just create a custom filter and copy this into the script.

input = self.GetUnstructuredGridInput() output = self.GetUnstructuredGridOutput() output.GetPointData().PassData(input.GetPointData()) output.GetCellData().PassData(input.GetCellData()) cellTypes = vtk.vtkUnsignedCharArray() cellTypes.DeepCopy(input.GetCellTypesArray()) cellTypes.SetName("Cell Types") output.GetCellData().AddArray(cellTypes)
If you plan to use this multiple times, you probably want to wrap this in a custom filter.

Subject: [Paraview] MPI performance and VGL error
In-Reply-To: <499BD57C.2080002@lrz.de>
Message-ID: <C5C19AD5.8288%kmorel@sandia.gov>

I will have to guess at why, say, contour is running slower.  I can think of two possibilities (but not claiming that either is necessarily correct).


 1.  Perhaps the data is not distributed.  If the reader is naive (you didn't specify what data you were reading), it could be just loading all of it on node 0.  The poor performance could simply be that the data is really being processed in serial.  Run the Process Id Scalars filter on the output of contour to make sure that the cells are distributed amongst the processes.
 2.  Some filters (contour included) need ghost cells.  When you add them, they will send a request up the pipeline to load another layer of ghost cells.  Assuming the reader supports it, the reader will usually reload the entire data set from file on each process to include the ghost cells.  There is a good chance that reading the data from disk is taking a lot longer than contouring the data.  Open the timer log (Tools -> Timer Log) and see how much time each component is taking.  If the contour filter is reported to run really fast (or missing from the timings if faster than the threshold) and the reader is running multiple times, then that is probably it.

As far as your problems with vglconnect, I am afraid I cannot be much help as I am unfamiliar with that hardware.  (Perhaps someone else on this list has run into this hardware.)  It sounds like the pvserver nodes are having trouble connecting to the appropriate X displays.  Usually this is a matter of getting your DISPLAY environment variables (or -display command line flags) correct.

Message-ID: <97d9bd670902181112v68405340h15a31a92fce2e9f8@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I am trying to write out a part of my *.vts file into a new *.vts file,
where the user can select the i,j,k.  In fact I would like to write out the
i and k for a given j.
In order to do this, I am using the vtkXMLStructuredGridWriter class, in
particular the SetWriteExtent<http://www.vtk.org/doc/release/5.2/html/a01601.html#661ae15ae5c0963599148b55c6041ad0>(int,
int, int, int, int, int) method.

The .vts file contains points data and 9 arrays of data such as velocity
etc.

If the SetWriteExtent method is called with (1 16 1 11 1 2) for example,
every thing works as normal and I can visualize the data using Paraview for
example.

However, if the argument is (1 1 1 11 1 2), the points are written out, but
the arrays containing velocity are not written - well the definitions are
written (Float data, etc) - but not the values.

What am i doing wrong here?  Incidentally I am on VTK-5.2
Perhaps, I am not using the write method, if thats the case can some one
please point me towards what method/classes I should be using?

Thanks,
Rakesh

I'm afraid not.  It looks like that functionality is not even support in VTK.  Implementing light emission that is constant for whole objects would be pretty straightforward, but would require modifying code all the way to VTK's rendering layer.

Hi Johannes,

as you're also working with Fortran, I think I can help you a little bit
more. I wrapped some files (
http://www.nacad.ufrj.br/~rnelias/paraview/xdmf/xdfm-files.zip) and Fortran
routines I use in my program to write the Xdmf as well as the HDF5. It's
also a cavity flow dataset (unstructured grid, 5 time steps partitioned in 4
parallel subdomains). Note that the Xdmf files are written using the
Fortran's FORMAT statement. I know it's a bit uggly but my data does not
vary between runs, so, why would I need to use a library with a bunch of
routines if just a couple of Fortran FORMATs solve my problem? Moreover,
FORMATs are quite portable between systems without the need to compile or
install anything else.

By the way, I loaded your files without any problem...

Just deleted your system path from the HDF5 DataItem reference, for example:

Original:

/home/johannes/workspace/XDMF/xdmf_data/LDCF/LDCF.h5:data/coordinates/x_v

Modified:
          LDCF.h5:data/coordinates/x_v

Voil?, it works ;o)
(thanks God)

Of course, the xdmf file, in this case, must be kept in the same directory
of the HDF5 files it makes references (I have no idea if Xdmf file could
point to HDF5 files in other directories...)

I hope it helps you

Subject: [Paraview] Changing the default volume mapper in Paraview?
Message-ID: <d0767b160902181542w6bc37b26v449be7a6d56a7ecc@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone.
I have debugged paraview for days. The reason is that I want to use
vtkOpenGLVolumeTextureMapper3d mapper instead of the default volume mapper
vtkFixedPointVolumeRayCastMapper in Paraview.
Till now, I haven't figured out how to do that. Has anyone done this before?
Any hint and help is greatly appreciated.
Thanks,

Aaron

Hi John,

I downloaded your dataset last night and just got tested it. But I get the
exact same error with your dataset as mine! Let me describe exactly
what/how I'm doing:

1. Loading the dataset
2. Selecting the dataset and create filter 'temporal cache'. Click Apply.
3. Creating a line from menu 'sources'. Modifying the line where I want to
have it. Click Apply.
4. Selecting my dataset go to filters and particletracer. In the new
window I'm choosing 'source' as input port. Under 'select source(s)' I'm
holding down the shift key and click on temporal cache and line. Then I
click OK.

5. Error appears! same as before:

ERROR: In ..\..\..\ParaView3\VTK\Filtering\vtkDemandDrivenPipeline.cxx,
line 822
vtkCompositeDataPipeline (0D4892A8): Input for connection index 0 on input
port index 1 for algorithm vtkTemporalStreamTracer(0D433300) is of type
vtkTemporalDataSet, but a vtkDataSet is required.

Am I doing something totally wrong??

Cheers,

Martin

WRONG!

The input is the termporal data (Temporal Cache)
The source is the seed points (Line)

There is a reason why there are TWO separate filter inputs. I'd have 
thought that that was so blindingly obvious that it didn't need explanation.

the inputs should be called "Temporal Input" and "Seeds", but 
unfortunately, the XML doesn't let me override the names inherited from 
StreamTracer.

Thanks a lot for this response Berk.

I will think about it. Not easy apparently.
The structured mesh edition (for FDTD purpose) is a particular task, and 
no library exists :-(.
I envisage to write an app based upon paraview, I need Paraview's large 
data handling capability.

Cheers,

Cyril Giraudon.

Subject: [Paraview] Changing the default volume mapper in Paraview?

I know it's kind of hacky, but you can simply edit the XML file and
change the mapper used. Look at
Servers/ServerManager/Resources/rendering.xml. In the XML for
"UniformGridVolumeRepresentation"
change FixedPointVolumeRayCastMapper to something else. Then after the
definition for FixedPointVolumeRayCastMapper, add a new definition for
the VolumeTextureMapper3D and use that in the
"UniformGridVolumeRepresentation". I am not sure it's going to work
out of the box. But work a try.

After 5.4 is released, can we expect (hope) for a move from CVS to git
or subversion?

In the next couple weeks we are planning to start the process of
creating the 5.4 version of VTK.  If you have tests on the main branch
that are currently failing on the dashboard please take the time correct
them next week.  Please hold off committing any changes that you will
not be able fully debug/test until after VTK has been branched for the
5.4 release.  We will let you know asap when the date of the CVS freeze
of VTK has been set.

 

Thank you for your time and help.

The cout is never shown since GetProxyName() returns 0 for the second
time around. A cleaner alternative would be to use the
vtkSMProxyIterator to iterate  over a group (using
iter->Begin("sources")).

Thank you, this was an oldie I found my way around :),
Instead of finding registered proxies and checking if their representation
existed, I used the pipelines and iterated over their properties with an
iterator.

Thanks!

Hi Samuele,

As you can see in the error, the pvtr file is missing the Source
attribute for each piece. Keep in mind that the XML format is case
sensitive. You should switch from source to Source.

Hi,

Sorry I missed this email until now.  I have some python code that
demonstrates how to use the new vtk based charts and vtkTable.  Using
this python interface it should be possible to save a screenshot of
the barchart or XY plot.  I have the code as a patch but it won't be
committed until after the vtk 5.4 release.

You can look at vtk/guisupport/qt/testing/cxx/TestVtkBarChartView.cxx as an example. You'll just have to convert it to python calls and import the right modules. I haven't played with vtk python, so I'm not sure what module the views show up in.

I am probably confused here but isn't setting ambient to larger than 0

There is a combo box in the Display tab that allows you to select the
volume mapper, but it looks like that combo box is not working.  I
know it used to work, does anyone know what happened?

Dear Berk,
I've switched from source to Source but nothing happened. Better, I get
a crash, now, instead of an error message.

Any other idea?

Thanks,
Samuele.

The combo-box is only for unstructured volume rendering (and works
perfectly fine for that). I believe Biao is taking about image data
volume rendering.

The TransformMatrix and AnatomicalOrientation seem to have no effect on 
the positioning of the data in an MHA file within paraview

TransformMatrix = 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
AnatomicalOrientation = RAI



shouldn't


TransformMatrix = 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0


produce a 90 deg rotation about the x-axis 
of the data in an mha file ?

In-Reply-To: <45d654b0902190645s2d3941a8qd080803f180cd085@mail.gmail.com>

No, they are different (although you might be able to get a similar effect).  The ambient light represents a base level of lighting coming from all directions that is formed (in real life) by light coming actual light sources and bouncing around the objects in the room.  It is the light that illuminates an object that is in shadow from all light sources.  Because OpenGL does not compute the amount of light that gets scattered around the scene, for each light you specify an ambient parameter representing the amount you expect the light to be bouncing around the scene.  OpenGL also allows you to specify different colors for ambient and diffuse reflection of materials.  In real life, these are always the same, but changing them sometimes allows you to work around some of the approximations that OpenGL makes.

Emission is light that originates directly from an object.  It is a color that is completely impendent of any lights (because the light is coming from the object itself).  Objects like turned on light bulbs or glow-in-the-dark toys have emission.  Unlike in real life, light from polygons with emission in OpenGL do not affect other objects (another approximation introduced by OpenGL).

For more information, check out the chapter on Lighting in the red OpenGL book.

Thanks for your help.
I have tried to change "FixedPointVolumeRayCastMapper to something else" in
the XML file. However, it still didn't work.
I am pretty new to these XML files. To the best of my knowledge, I changed
the XML file to:
<SubProxy>
        <Proxy name="VolumeFixedPointRayCastMapper"
          proxygroup="mappers"
          proxyname="OpenGLVolumeTextureMapper3D">
        </Proxy>
 </SubProxy>
I simply delete the "ExposedProperties" part for this mapper, because I
don't know how to decide which property should be exposed.
After those changes, I opened the iron_protein.vtk data with paraview. Here
is the error message I got:

Unhandled exception at 0x0519e423(vtkPVServerManager.dll) in paraview.exe:
0xC0000005: Access violation reading location 0x00000000.

Is that because the proxyname is wrong? Or do I ???? ?? ?????? ????
???????????

Did you add a new proxy definition for the
"OpenGLVolumeTextureMapper3D" proxy? Look at the definition for
"VolumeFixedPointRayCastMapper" (it's further down in the file).
You'll need to add a similar one for the "OpenGLVolumeTextureMapper3D"
proxy.

Message-ID: <01892D25-00F2-4197-BFDC-8F07412FFFD2@cs.duke.edu>

Hey,

I was just trying out some python state loading (outside of ParaView)  
for saving animations, and my old scripts are not working.

pm = servermanager.ProxyManager()
pm.GetProxiesInGroup("sources")

now seems to return a dictionary where the keys are a tuple of two  
strings (a name and a number) instead of just a name string. Has  
something changed in CVS recently, or am I doing something screwy?

Thanks,
-Eric

Subject: [Paraview] Extracting data
Message-ID: <97d9bd670902191252k5b5da4ebj318fc15fac490f6a@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I have a multi-block time series data set (23 blocks).  I select some blocks
(0,6,12,18) using extractBlock
filter.  I then use the plot over line to plot some variables in my selected
blocks.

If i wanted to save the extracted blocks, i can save as a *.vtm file.
However, it only saves the current time step
as far as I can see.  Is there any way of saving all of the time steps (of
the extracted data).

I guess basically, I am trying to save a sub set of my initial data set, and
my problem is it is only saving the
current time step.  Can some one tell me what I am doing wrong?

Regards,
Rakesh

I didn't add a new proxy definition for "OpenGLVolumeTextureMapper3D".
Instead, I change the definition for "VolumeFixedPointRayCastMapper" to
something like that:
<SubProxy>
         <Proxy name="VolumeFixedPointRayCastMapper"
           proxygroup="mappers"
           proxyname="OpenGLVolumeTextureMapper3D">
         </Proxy>
  </SubProxy>
It didn't work.
By now, I have tried to add a new proxy definition for
"OpenGLVolumeTextureMapper3D", but I got the same error message. The
following is the XML proxy I wrote:
<SubProxy>
        <Proxy name="VolumeOpenGLTexture3DMapper"
          proxygroup="mappers"
          proxyname="OpenGLVolumeTextureMapper3D">
        </Proxy>
        <ExposedProperties>
          <Property name="SampleDistance" />
        </ExposedProperties>
</SubProxy>
I am wondering if I understand you incorrect.
Also, I notice that in the vtkSMUniformGridVolumeRepresentationProxy.cxx
file (Servers/ServerManager/), between line 100~117, there are some code
specifically related to VolumeFixedPointRayCastMapper, do I need to change
these codes too?

Thanks very much for your help.

Biao

Sorry, please ignore the first question. I know what you mean right now.
But, please look at the second question:
"Also, I notice that in the vtkSMUniformGridVolumeRepresentationProxy.cxx
file (Servers/ServerManager/), between line 100~117, there are some code
specifically related to VolumeFixedPointRayCastMapper, do I need to change
these codes too?"

Thanks,

No, unless you changed the name for the subproxy which is the "name"
in <SubProxy><Proxy name=".." /></SubProxy>. I'll leave that as is so
the vtkSMUniformGridVolumeRepresentationProxy will just work.

Thanks very much for your help, Utkarsh.
The "OpenGLVolumeTextureMapper3D" works right now.
Just for future reference, here are instructions to make a volume mapper
available in paraview:
1. open the rendering.xml file at the
"/$Paraveiw-Source-Directory/Servers/ServerManager/Resources" directory.
2. copy the SourceProxy definition of "FixedPointVolumeRayCastMapper", paste
it after the definition and made the following changes: (the bold ones are
the places where I made changes )
<SourceProxy name="*OpenGLVolumeTextureMapper3D*"
      class="*vtkOpenGLVolumeTextureMapper3D*">
      <InputProperty
        name="Input"
        command="SetInputConnection">
        <DataTypeDomain name="input_type">
          <DataType value="vtkImageData"/>
        </DataTypeDomain>
      </InputProperty>
      <StringVectorProperty
        name="SelectScalarArray"
        command="SelectScalarArray"
        number_of_elements="1"
        animateable="0">
        <ArrayListDomain name="array_list" attribute_type="Scalars">
          <RequiredProperties>
            <Property name="Input" function="Input"/>
          </RequiredProperties>
        </ArrayListDomain>
      </StringVectorProperty>
      <IntVectorProperty
        name="ScalarMode"
        command="SetScalarMode"
        default_values="3"
        number_of_elements="1"
        animateable="0">
        <EnumerationDomain name="enum">
          <Entry value="0" text="Default"/>
          <Entry value="1" text="PointData"/>
          <Entry value="2" text="CellData"/>
          <Entry value="3" text="PointFieldData"/>
          <Entry value="4" text="CellFieldData"/>
        </EnumerationDomain>
      </IntVectorProperty>
      <IntVectorProperty
        name="LockSampleDistanceToInputSpacing"
        command="SetLockSampleDistanceToInputSpacing"
        default_values="1"
        number_of_elements="1"
        animateable="0">
        <BooleanDomain name="bool" />
      </IntVectorProperty>
      <!-- End of FixedPointVolumeRayCastMapper -->
    </SourceProxy>
3. find the SubProxy of VolumeFixedPointRayCastMapper, make the following
change (bold):
<SubProxy>
        <Proxy name="VolumeFixedPointRayCastMapper"
          proxygroup="mappers"
          proxyname="*OpenGLVolumeTextureMapper3D*">
        </Proxy>
        <ExposedProperties>
          <Property name="LockSampleDistanceToInputSpacing" />
        </ExposedProperties>
</SubProxy>
4. find the header file of vtkOpenGLVolumeTextureMapper3D at the
"/$Paraveiw-Source-Directory/VTK/VolumeRendering/" directory.
add "*vtkSetClampMacro( LockSampleDistanceToInputSpacing, int, 0, 1 );*" as
public method,
add "*int  LockSampleDistanceToInputSpacing;*" as a protected variable.
5. compile your program and go.

I understand that "vtkOpenGLVolumeTextureMapper3D" mapper doesn't need a
property of "LockSampleDistanceToInputSpacing", but this is the fastest way
for me to make the mapper works.
Any clue about how to get rid of the variable?
Thanks again for all the helps!

Subject: [Paraview] Change reader file name in python loaded state
Message-ID: <6636EE19-04CF-4B46-BBE9-933EC0D7E463@cs.duke.edu>

Hey again,

Back maybe around PV 3.2, I could load a state file in Python (outside  
of PV) which included readers for pvd files. I could find the proxies  
for the file readers, and then change the file name, update the  
pipeline, and then save or display an animation using the new data  
set. I haven't tried this for a while because I'm now working with  
Xdmf files, and the reader didn't work with ParaView & Python well  
enough until more recently.

Now, when I try the same scripts, the reader on which I change the  
file name doesn't show anything at all in the render view. (i.e. I  
have two readers in my pipeline -- if I don't change any file names I  
can load in the state file and animate fine -- if I change one file  
name only that element of my visualization drops out, but I can see  
and animate the other -- if I change both names the renderview looks  
blank during the whole animation.)

I'm doing something like:

from paraview import servermanger
servermanager.Connect()
servermanager.LoadState("/Users/emonson/Data/StateFile.pvsm")
pm = servermanager.ProxyManager()

reader = pm.GetProxy("sources","OriginalDataSet.xmf")
reader.FileName = "/Users/emonson/Data/NewDataSet.xmf"
reader.UpdatePipeline()
view = servermanager.GetRenderView()
view.StillRender()

I see that in CVS there is a reader.FileNameChanged(), but calling  
that doesn't seem to fix it.

Is there something obvious I'm failing to do, or does this look like  
this should work?

Thanks,
-Eric

Subject: [Paraview] problems with repeatable input to filter
Message-ID: <BAY122-W22B8896B92A891E2C34D78BCB30@phx.gbl>


Hi!
I?m trying to write a filter with multiple inputs, in my case I need two datasets as input to this filter. In order to achieve that, I have the following routine in my code:

int vtkTauFilter::FillInputInformation(int port, vtkInformation* info)
{
 info -> Set(vtkAlgorithm::INPUT_REQUIRED_DATA_TYPE(),"vtkDataSet");
 info -> Set(vtkAlgorithm::INPUT_IS_REPEATABLE(), 1);
 return 1;
}

and I put in the /Servers/ServerManager/Resources/filters.xml file the following:

 <SourceProxy name="TauFilter" class="vtkTauFilter" label="TauFilter">
     ....
     <InputProperty name="Input" command="AddInputConnection" clean_command="RemoveAllInputs" multiple_input="1">
         <ProxyGroupDomain name="groups">
             <Group name="sources"/>
             <Group name="filters"/>
         </ProxyGroupDomain>

         ...
 </SourceProxy>


Compiling Paraview works fine, but I get the error:
ERROR: In /ParaView-3.4.0/VTK/Filtering/vtkDemandDrivenPipeline.cxx, line 732
vtkCompositeDataPipeline (0x357dd50): Input port 0 of algorithm vtkTauFilter(0x357bff0) has 2 connections but is not repeatable.

Does anyone know what?s could be the problem here?

thx a lot,
Natalie

Have you tried just removing the property
"LockSampleDistanceToInputSpacing" from the XML?

Subject: [Paraview] problems with repeatable input to filter
In-Reply-To: <BAY122-W22B8896B92A891E2C34D78BCB30@phx.gbl>
References: <BAY122-W22B8896B92A891E2C34D78BCB30@phx.gbl>
Message-ID: <499EC72E.20602@kitware.com>

Hi,
I wrote one a while back and I did it another way.

in the constructor:
  this->SetNumberOfInputPorts(2);

add a couple of methods like this:
void vtkBlahFilter::SetDataSet1Connection(vtkAlgorithmOutput* algOutput)
{
  this->SetInputConnection(0, algOutput);
}
void vtkBlahFilter::SetDataSet2Connection(vtkAlgorithmOutput* algOutput)
{
  this->SetInputConnection(0, algOutput);
}

in request data, the two data set are in the first two information 
vector entries:
  vtkInformation *inInfo;
  inInfo = inputVector[0]->GetInformationObject(0);
  
dataSet1=vtkBlahDataSet::SafeDownCast(inInfo->Get(vtkDataObject::DATA_OBJECT()));
  inInfo = inputVector[1]->GetInformationObject(0);
  
dataSet2=vtkBlahDataSet::SafeDownCast(inInfo->Get(vtkDataObject::DATA_OBJECT()));

in the filters.xml:
<InputProperty
       name="Input"
       command="SetDataSet1Connection">
       <ProxyGroupDomain name="groups">
         <Group name="sources"/>
         <Group name="filters"/>
       </ProxyGroupDomain>
       <DataTypeDomain name="input_type">
       <DataType value="vtkBlahDataSet"/>
       </DataTypeDomain>
     </InputProperty>
     <InputProperty
       name="Source"
       command="SetDataSet2Connection">
       <ProxyGroupDomain name="groups">
         <Group name="sources"/>
         <Group name="filters"/>
       </ProxyGroupDomain>
       <DataTypeDomain name="input_type">
         <DataType value="vtkBlahDataSet"/>
       </DataTypeDomain>
     </InputProperty>

I think that is all. Not sure it's the best way, but it worked.

Burlen's code looks right, but I believe the SetDataSet2Connection
should be like this (change 0 to 1):

void vtkBlahFilter::SetDataSet2Connection(vtkAlgorithmOutput* algOutput)
 {
 this->SetInputConnection(1, algOutput);
}

Subject: [Paraview] vtkCompositeDataSet - memory ?
Message-ID: <!&!AAAAAAAAAAAYAAAAAAAAAF0V88snc7NDnLzKjZ+tgCrCgAAAEAAAAHyQJXS4SkRHhwcCbnh6kAcBAAAAAA==@ara.co.uk>

Hi all, 

I'm writing a reader for a dataset which has boundary faces (tri and quads)
as well as volume cells (tets etc..). 
In would like to use a CompositeDataSet as a container, so that I can easily
extract boundary faces which are groupesd in named zones (for ex: upper_surf
lower_surf etc...). 

The problem I encounter is that if I us a vtkMultiblockDataSet composed of
vtkUnstructuredGrid there is no relationship between the separate blocks.
This means that I need to duplicate points which are shared between the
different blocks, duplicate the data associated to thes points etc ... 

Is there a vtkCompositeDataSet where all the points and data are shared
between the branches and the only difference is the cells ?

Thank you for your guidance.

You can share the points by simply creating one vtkPoints object and then passing those points to all the unstructured grids in your data object.  Then all the blocks will be sharing that data.

Note, however, that ParaView will not actually check that.  Thus it will probably incorrectly count the number of points and the amount of memory the points take up multiple times, one for each block.  Also, if you pass the data through a filter that changes the points, those downstream filters will replicate their point data.

Hi all,

I'm writing a reader for a dataset which has boundary faces (tri and quads)
as well as volume cells (tets etc..).
In would like to use a CompositeDataSet as a container, so that I can easily
extract boundary faces which are groupesd in named zones (for ex: upper_surf
lower_surf etc...).

The problem I encounter is that if I us a vtkMultiblockDataSet composed of
vtkUnstructuredGrid there is no relationship between the separate blocks.
This means that I need to duplicate points which are shared between the
different blocks, duplicate the data associated to thes points etc ...

Is there a vtkCompositeDataSet where all the points and data are shared
between the branches and the only difference is the cells ?

Thank you for your guidance.

If all of the grids that are used in the vtkMultiBlockDataSet derive from
vtkPointSet, you can use the same vtkPoints for each of the grids.  They
should also have the same vtkPointData as a result so that data is not
duplicated.

In that case simply remove  the "command" attribute from  the
"LockSampleDistanceToInputSpacing" property. That way ParaView will
not try to call that method on the vtkOpenGLVolumeTextureMapper3D
class.

Subject: [Paraview] Mesh Subdivision
Message-ID: <c19fcadc0902201310y27b62067u71004e2dd46079ee@mail.gmail.com>

I have a polydata (vtp) with a bunch of triangles. I want to smooth the
mesh. I tried the subdivide filter, but it produces absolutely ridiculous
triangles. So I thought this meant the connectivity information was wrong?
So I tried the TriangleStrips filter and then the subdivide filter, but now
the subdivide filter complains that there are no triangles. I tried
triangulate and then subdivide and I get the same mess as in the first case.

In all cases, the LoopSubdivision filter simply crashes. There is clearly
still something wrong with my understanding of these file formats and which
filters can be used on which types of files. Can anyone clarify this for me?

Thanks,

David

Thank you,

This is what I coded up (using setpoints for each vtkUnstructuredGrid with
the same vtkPoints).
I was then just surprised to see that the number of points in ParaView was
multiplied by my number of blocks and therefore believed the memory used was
multiplied. Is there any way of making sure that ParaView actually does
reflect the correct number of points?

Kind Regards,
Jacques

So if my file just contains a bunch of triangles, how can I make it into a
valid input mesh?

Thanks,

David

The file needs to have connectivity information. If it does not then  
you will need to construct that information. You can look at the  
vtkSTLReader class for an example of how you might go about doing that.

Well actually I think there should be connectivity information. This file
was made using the DelaunayTriangulation2d filter, then the 2d points were
replaced with 3d points, so the topology should be correct (ie the triangles
share the correct points).

Thanks,

David

Subject: [Paraview] Location widgets properties
Message-ID: <fb2577d80902212133n6fdeb36al7194ad7a09cd18c0@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I have a plugin that use location widgets to manipulate points position.
To create the widgets, I use vtkSMNewWidgetRepresentationProxy.
I am able to manipulate the points position correctly, but I would
like to manipulate some other properties of these widgets specially
colors.
Anyone know how can I change the color of vtkSMNewWidgetRepresentationProxy ?

Thank you

Hi,

I suggest you to pass your polydata through a vtkCleanPolyData . This should
solves problems of "twin" points that break the connectivity information
(and thus the topology).

Best regard,

Jerome

Subject: [Paraview] Transform Filter Loses Colors of VTPs
Message-ID: <c19fcadc0902221430l688d3ba8k9249e4f734a1f453@mail.gmail.com>

If I take a point cloud (topology: vertices, geometry: colored points) and
use the Transform Filter, the color array seems to go along for a ride (I
still see it in the information), but I can no longer color the points using
the color array, the "map scalars" box is checked but greyed out. Is there a
way to show the colors after a transform?

(This only happens with vtp files, with vtu's it works correctly)

Thanks,

David

Something is fishy. You may have encountered a bug. Can you share a
dataset? Can you describe the steps you used to produce it?

Hi,

I want to simulate moving particles in a sequence and keep the contour
image from the first time frame. I've been trying with a bunch of filters
like temporal types, extracting types but also mixing a lot with animation
inspector.
My results though is always the same, the contour is being recalculated in
every time frame. Is there a way to ignore this? (I've also tried to
uncheck the three components, compute normals, compute gradients and
compute scalars in properties of the contuor filter.)

Thankful for help.

Cheers,

Martin

In my own experience, it is often the case that different Data arrays
can be defined on the 3D blocks and on the 2D boundary surfaces. I just
wanted to point out that ParaView is smart enough to enable this and to
annotate  data arrays of name VAR as  "VAR (partial)". Thus, there is no
confusion for the User that he/she is selecting a data array that is
strictly defined on only a subset of parts.

Subject: [Paraview] use of vtkSynchronizedTemplates
Message-ID: <BAY122-W478504DD160564026F8FD5BCAE0@phx.gbl>


Hi!
I want to display isosurfaces of values I compute in my filter, so looking at vtkContourFilter, I got the idea to use the vtkSynchronizedTemplates3D (as my filter is going to handle 3D ImageData).
I have a vtkSynchronizedTemplate3D as an instance of my filter, in the constructor it?s initialized and then I do the following:


this -> SynchronizedTemplates3D -> SetInput(TauSet);
this -> SynchronizedTemplates3D -> ComputeNormalsOff();
this -> SynchronizedTemplates3D -> ComputeGradientsOff();
this -> SynchronizedTemplates3D -> SetComputeScalars(1);
this -> SynchronizedTemplates3D -> SetNumberOfContours(1);
this -> SynchronizedTemplates3D -> SetValue(0, TauValue);

int ext[6];
inInfo -> Get(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::WHOLE_EXTENT(), ext);
this -> SynchronizedTemplates3D -> ThreadedExecute(TauSet,inInfo,outInfo,ext, TauValues);


It does compile, but running I get an segmentation fault, debugging and backtracing I get:

#0  0x00007f42ffc5eb10 in ContourImage<double> () from /home/happenhofer/Paraview/build-svn/bin/libvtkGraphics.so.pv3.4
#1  0x00007f42ffc5a308 in vtkSynchronizedTemplates3D::ThreadedExecute () from /home/happenhofer/Paraview/build-svn/bin/libvtkGraphics.so.pv3.4
#2  0x00007f4309195f06 in vtkTauFilter::RequestData () from /home/happenhofer/Paraview/build-svn/bin/libvtkPVFilters.so

vtkTauFilter would be my filter, so the error occurs in ContourImage<double>.

Does anyone have an idea even how to find the problem? That would be a great help.. 

and just in general - calling ThreadedExecute would execute the SynchronizedTemplate filter and return a grid with the isosurface computed, does it not? or do I have to specifiy the output somehow?

thx a lot,
Natalie Happenhofer

Nehme,

There's no easy way to do that. You'll have to use client-server
streams and manipulate the server side representation object directly.

Message-ID: <49A2B920.2000804@laposte.net>

Hi,

I try to write a VTK compressed file (uncompressed works fine), but I 
have the following error when I open it in Paraview:

ERROR: In /build/buildd/paraview-3.2.2/VTK/IO/vtkXMLDataParser.cxx, line 
434
vtkXMLDataParser (0xa02c998): Error reading beginning of compression 
header. Read 0 of 12 bytes.

ERROR: In

line 515
vtkXMLUnstructuredGridReader (0xa030228): Cannot read points array from 
Points in piece 0. The data array in the element may be too short.


I don't understand what is wrong. I followed instructions from 
(http://www.vtkedge.org/Wiki/VTK_XML_Formats), using only one block at 
the moment. I read the header with GHex and it seems OK. The critical 
part of the code is (zlib_compress is a function I implemented to 
compress the buffer). :

#ifdef HAVE_ZLIB
    if (compression_level!=0){
        unsigned int header[4];
        header[0]=1;
        header[1]=data_size;
        header[2]=0;
        header[3] = ((int)(data_size*1.002))+13;
        unsigned char *compressed_sol = (unsigned char*)malloc (header[3]);
        zlib_compress((unsigned 
char*)buffer_sol.str().c_str(),compressed_sol,data_size,&header[3],compression_level); 

        fstream_sol.write((char *)header,4*sizeof(unsigned int));
        fstream_sol.write((char*)compressed_sol,header[3]);
        free(compressed_sol);
    }else
#endif
    {
        fstream_sol.write((char *)(&data_size),sizeof(unsigned int));
        fstream_sol.write(buffer_sol.str().c_str(),pos_end-pos_start);
    }

Do you have any idea of what can be wrong?

Thanks for any help,

Message-ID: <d0767b160902230947vd05a62ard163a6375bf197b0@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone.
I have successfully created a plugin for paraview in Linux. Now I want to
move it to Windows.
CMake vs8 2005 code generator is used for generating the plugin project.
Nothing went wrong before I tried to build the project. I got the following
two building errors:
1>C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\VC\include\cstdlib(18) : error
C2143: syntax error : missing ';' before 'namespace'
1>vtkMyDICOMReader.cxx
1>C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\VC\include\string(15) : error
C2143: syntax error : missing ';' before 'namespace'

I have tried to add semicolons before the namespaces, but it leads me to
more errors. My source code should be fine since it works for Linux. Does
anyone have an idea about how to fix the problem? Thanks.

Hi Samuele,

I made a few changes to your files.

Hey Tobias,

thank you very much. It works great, now.

Just a question: what does GhostLevel="1" mean? Does it mean that I have
a "plane" which is both in  1st and in 2nd file?

Thanks again for your great help,

Samuele.

Did you try calling Update() on SynchronizedTemplated3D instead of
ThreadedExecute()? ThreadedExecute() is really meant to be used
internally.

The quickest work-around is to save the contour(s) from the first time
step as a polydata and load it back in. I can't remember if we ended
up creating a filter that suppresses time requests.

GetProxiesInGroup() should return a dictionary where the keys are the
proxy names and the values are the proxies themselves. Is that not the
case?

Hey Berk,

Say I have a pipeline with a box and point source, from the Python  
shell (CVS Feb 18, 2009):

Python 2.5.2 |EPD 2.5.2001| (r252:60911, Aug 4 2008, 13:45:20)
[GCC 4.0.1 (Apple Computer, Inc. build 5370)] on darwin
 >>> from paraview.simple import *
 >>> pm = servermanager.ProxyManager()
 >>> pm.GetProxiesInGroup("sources")
{('Box1', '363'): <paraview.servermanager.Box object at 0x224c5670>,  
('PointSource1', '114'): <paraview.servermanager.PointSource object at  
0x224c5530>}
 >>>

I can program around it,  but I was just curious what the the second  
member of the tuple is for.

Hi everyone.
I have successfully created a plugin for paraview in Linux. Now I want to move it to Windows.
CMake vs8 2005 code generator is used for generating the plugin project. Nothing went wrong before I tried to build the project. I got the following two building errors:
1>C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\VC\include\cstdlib(18) : error C2143: syntax error : missing ';' before 'namespace'
1>vtkMyDICOMReader.cxx
1>C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\VC\include\string(15) : error C2143: syntax error : missing ';' before 'namespace'

I have tried to add semicolons before the namespaces, but it leads me to more errors. My source code should be fine since it works for Linux. Does anyone have an idea about how to fix the problem? Thanks.

Hi!

Update() doesn?t work either, I still get the segmentation fault. (I hate segmentation faults, you never know what?s causing them). At least  I?d need to call the vtkContourFilter from my filter, surely there is a possibility? How could I achieve that? Or maybe there are any filters in paraview which are already calling other filters? 

thx,
Natalie

Subject: [Paraview] problems with reading hdf5-files
Message-ID: <BAY122-W36E12BCE38C95B6F369071BCAF0@phx.gbl>


Hi!
I still encounter problems with paraview when I want it to visualize vector attribute data. I put it in my Xdmf-File (the xmf-part) like this:

..
<Grid Name="Curvilinear" GridType="Uniform">
<Topology TopologyType="2DSMesh" Dimensions ="151 390" >
</Topology>
<Geometry GeometryType="XYZ">
<DataItem Name="Coordinates" DataType="Float" Precision="4" Dimensions="58890 3" Format="HDF">
c2d-T358-5500K-medium_00800.h5:/Curvilinear/Coordinates
</DataItem>
</Geometry>
..

scalar data looks like this:
..
<Attribute Name="Fc" Type="Scalar" Center="Node">
<DataItem DataType="Float" Precision="4" Dimensions="151 390" Format="HDF">
c2d-T358-5500K-medium_00800.h5:/Curvilinear/Fc
</DataItem>
</Attribute>
.. (this is read without problems)

and vector attribute data:

<Attribute Name="xm_ym" Type="Vector" Center="Node">
<DataItem DataType="Float" Precision="4" Dimensions="151 390 3" Format="HDF">
c2d-T358-5500K-medium_00800.h5:/Curvilinear/xm_ym
</DataItem>
</Attribute>

looking at the h5-file with the hdfViewer, the dataset "xm_ym" has perfectly the dimensions I want it to have, i.e. "151 390 3", but opening it with paraview, paraview does not read all points, I get the following error:
 
ERROR: In ..\..\..\ParaView3\VTK\Filtering\vtkDataSet.cxx, line 406
vtkStructuredGrid (06A97048): Point array xm_ym with 3 components, only has 19630 tuples but there are 58890 points
??
thx,Natalie

At quick glance your compression header writing code looks okay.  However,
this error occurs before the parser even tries to interpret the compression
header, so something else must be wrong.  Can you send me a small example
file produced by your writer, please (off list)?

If you mean the new python based calculator in the development

use the calculator filter from within python, perhaps this email will
be of use:

Note that the error occurs when reading the Points array, not your data array.
The problem is here:

<Points>
  <DataArray type="Float64" NumberOfComponents="3" format="appended" offset="16420"/>
</Points>

The offset needs to point at the offset from '_' to the beginning of the
compression header for the Points array.  The offset you give is the
uncompressed size, but it should account for the compressed size of the
array before it.

Note that files written by VTK have extra whitespace after the offset field
because they actually reserve space to seek back and set it *after* writing
earlier arrays to the AppendedData section.

You're right, I didn't change the offset for the compressed files. I 
wrote now the offsets a posteriori with fgetpos/fsetpos and it is OK.

Thanks for your help,

Okay, so this is just an issue with the XDMF reader. It still works  
fine with the PVD reader.

To do this type of thing with XDMF, (after loading in the state file)  
I have to create a new reader and representation, register them, then  
change the input of the next element in the pipeline to the new reader.

Talk to you later,

Message-ID: <779dabeb0902241555m7c2408f9ra9608edab7f5616f@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I have some slice based MRI data that I'd like to display in paraview
(so I can do contouring and so on). I have multiple slices in
different planes that I'd like to display in their correct relative
positions.

The problem is that paraview appears to ignore all of the orientation
information, so I'm after ideas about how to do this correctly.

Some thoughts I'd like some recommendations on are:

use ITK to generate a coordinate for each voxel and convert to a
format which supports position and value for each node - but which
one?

Load as an image and apply the transformations inside paraview. This
would require extracting the transformation matrices from the mri
data, which is doable, but I'm not sure how to apply the
transformation in paraview - any suggestions?

Thanks

Do you have a particular reason to need this functionality?  This bug has never been high priority because there does not seem to be any real need for it.  That file is the only example I have ever run into of a legacy VTK file with no DATASET type specified.

I'm using  the programmmable source to generate a simple mesh.
Until now, I was using vtk.vtkUnstructuredGrid.SetCells(int,  
vtkCellArray) to set the generated mesh to the output. It work fine  
for meshes of only one type.

now I am trying to generate a mesh with different elements types. but  
I wasn't able to add meshes with different types to the output.
I am trying with the function:

V.SetCells(vtkUnsignedCharArray *cellTypes, vtkIdTypeArray  
*cellLocations, vtkCellArray *Cells);

but I don't understand the cellLocations input variable.
-------------
How can I correctly use the vtkSphereSource in the programmable  
Source?. Once the instance is correctly created, How do I extract the  
mesh of the sphere to put it in the output?

Thanks

I?m writing a filter that has as output an Unstructured Grid. As far as I know, to specify that grid, I need to specify the points and the cells. I?m wondering how to specify the cells - I need quadrilaterals. How can I specify them? I need a routine which lets me specify the points (4 in that case) and then insert it into a vtkCellList, which I can assign to the output. 

thx,
Natalie

Hey Natalie,

There are also a bunch of examples of building unstructured grids with  
various types of cells if you follow the link for test code in the  
doxygen page for vtkUnstructuredGrid (Tests).

http://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/c2_vtk_t_17.html#c2_vtk_t_vtkUnstructuredGrid

It is strange that the first signature doesn't work. What happens when
you call it? vtkUnstructuredGrid should build the Locations array for
you.

The Locations array is a set of pointers into the UnstructuredGrid's
internal pointid array. Because the cell types are not homogeneous,
they have different numbers of points, so this array is needed to give
random access to the cells.

The pointidarray looks like this:
0[cell0=VTK_VERTEX ]
1[cell0's first point id=somewhere in point array]
2[cell1=VTK_QUAD]
3[cell1's first point id...]
4[cell1's second point id...]
5[cell1's third point id...]
6[cell1's fourth point id...]
7[cell2=something]
...

the Locations array gives you random access because each cell in it is
the same size. It looks like this:
0[cell0 starts at 0]
1[cell1 starts at 2]
2[cell2 starts at 7]
...

You have to update the SphereSource, then get is PolyData output, then
copy each vertex and cell into the filter's output.

Message-ID: <EE35CDB51A4F8F40820C05C4D2EAF2B507D69E@cf--amer001e--3.americas.sgi.com>

Hi,
 
I am able to run pvserver on my Linux cluster and paraview (3.4.0) on my PC.  I am
able to connect to the server and I can calculate and display a contour (note, the server
has no gfx, so there is no remote rendering).
 
Next I tired:
 
mpirun -np pvserver
 
And again I can connect from paraview on the PC and calculate and display the contour.
 
However, when I now exit paraview, pvserver on the cluster displays the following message:
 
Client connection closed.
MPI: could not run executable (case #3)
MPI: No details available, no log files found
Killed
 
It only displays this as it exits.  I guess this means the server is not doing any
parallel work - is there a way to tell if the server is working correctly in parallel mode?
 
What might this problem be casued by?
 
 
 
Thanks

A couple of things to try:

When you are connected to a parallel filter, you can access the
process id scalars filter. That tells each process on the server to
color its cells with its own color. With that you can seel which cells
were processed on which server node.

Edit->settings->render view->server->remote render threshold can be
used to force it to render on the server. Assuming you are not using
offscreen rendering, checking that and setting it to 0MB will make it
pop up windows on each server node that you can look at.

Try putting print statements in with the python programmable filter.
Every time that filter re-executes, each server node will print
something to the console.

Probably a dumb question but is the server compiled with MPI support?
What do you see if you create a sphere and then apply process id
scalars?

Hi everyone.
I am trying to write a new reader plugin for Paraview. However, I get the
following error when I try to use it:

ERROR: In
/usr/scratch/bshe/Paraview/ParaView-3.4.0/Servers/Common/vtkProcessModule.cxx,
line 1079
vtkProcessModule (0x8c24658): Cannot create object of type "vtkMyReader".
while processing
Message 0 = New
  Argument 0 = string_value {vtkMyReader}
  Argument 1 = id_value {84}



ERROR: In
/usr/scratch/bshe/Paraview/ParaView-3.4.0/Servers/Common/vtkProcessModule.cxx,
line 1080
vtkProcessModule (0x8c24658): Aborting execution for debugging purposes.

It seems to be a vtkMyReader construction problem. (Please correct me if
not)
My vtkMyReader is derived from vtkImageReader2, and it has a public static
method for construction in .h file - static vtkDICOMImageReaderCopy *New().
I am wondering if I have to write some code for this method in the
vtkMyReader implementation (.cxx file) to fix the error?

Thanks

Biao

Hi Jim,

The binaries we create are not compiled with MPI (because there are
many different MPI implementations). If you want to run ParaView with
MPI, you have to compile it yourself.

Have you written the xml configuration file that tells ParaView how to
call the reader?

Sorry, I should have thought before I replied.  Of course you have XML
or else paraview wouldn't know to ask the ProcessModule to try to
create a vtkMyReader.

Check for the inclusion of the vtkObjectFactory and the use of
vtkStandardNewMacro in the .cxx file. Also check that the classes
filename and class name match that in of the class= attribute in the
XML file.

Thanks for your reply.
I have included vtkObjectFactory and have used
vtkStandardNewMacro(vtkMyReader) in the .cxx file. The class filename and
class name also match the class=attribute in the XML file. But the error
message still appeares.

I think I have found a way to solve the problem. Thanks for your help. It
gave me useful hints.
I first moved the source files (.cxx and .h files) for vtkMyReader into the
$paraview_sourcet/VTK/IO directory, and modified the CMakelist.txt in this
directory by adding vtkMyReader.cxx into the "kit_src" list. After that, I
wrote two XML files to expose this reader. Everything works fine.
Still, I have questions. According to the paraview user guide, the first
step shouldn't be neccessary. I should be able to write a plugin without the
need to change paraview source code. I am not very familar with CMake and
VTK, but I am sure that the problem must be in my CMakeList.txt file for the
plugin. The file looks like the following:

FIND_PACKAGE(ParaView REQUIRED)
INCLUDE(${PARAVIEW_USE_FILE})

ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN(myReader "1.0" SERVER_MANAGER_SOURCES
vtkMyReader.cxx)
ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN(myReader "1.0" GUI_RESOURCE_FILES pqReader.xml)
ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN(myReader "1.0" SERVER_MANAGER_XML reader.xml)

I am using the Cmake cdt 4 generator. Could anyone tell me how to change the
cmake file to make my plugin works without changing the paraview source
code?

Thanks

Just for testing I wrote a filter which should draw an unstructured grid with one cell, here is the code (i.e. the RequestData(...) routine:

int vtkTestUnstructuredGrid::RequestData(vtkInformation* vtkNotUsed(request),
                                      vtkInformationVector **inputVector,
                                      vtkInformationVector *outputVector)
{ //get the input and the output
 vtkDataSet* input = vtkDataSet::GetData(inputVector[0]);
 vtkUnstructuredGrid* output = vtkUnstructuredGrid::GetData(outputVector);

 vtkPoints* pts = vtkPoints::New();
 pts -> InsertNextPoint(0,0,0); //0
 pts -> InsertNextPoint(1,-1,0);
 pts -> InsertNextPoint(1,1,0);
 pts -> InsertNextPoint(0.5,0,1);

 output -> SetPoints(pts);
 int numOfPoints = output -> GetNumberOfPoints();

 vtkTetra* tetra = vtkTetra::New();
 tetra -> GetPointIds() -> SetId(0,0);
 tetra -> GetPointIds() -> SetId(1,1);
 tetra -> GetPointIds() -> SetId(2,2);
 tetra -> GetPointIds() -> SetId(3,3);

output -> InsertNextCell(tetra -> GetCellType(), tetra -> GetPointIds());
int numOfCells = output -> GetNumberOfCells();

tetra -> Delete();
 return 1;
}


Debugging, I find that the points have been inserted correctly to the output, but I still have a problem with the cell. Executing the filter, I get a segmentation fault, originated by  

output -> InsertNextCell(tetra -> GetCellType(), tetra -> GetPointIds());

Do I need to allocate memory separately for the cells, or..? 

thx a lot,
Natalie

Yes it shouldn't be necessary to move your code in with the paraview code.

I think each of your calls to ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN is probably
overriting the previous ones. Simply call the macro once like so:

FIND_PACKAGE(ParaView REQUIRED)
INCLUDE(${PARAVIEW_USE_FILE})

ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN(
   myReader "1.0"
  SERVER_MANAGER_SOURCES vtkMyReader.cxx
  SERVER_MANAGER_XML reader.xml
  GUI_RESOURCE_FILES pqReader.xml)

Been a while but you may need output->BuildLinks();

You can also do output->Printself(std::cout, vtkIndent);// Or  
something like that

to see if you are really getting what you _think_ you are producing.

Hey,

Is there a way to hide / turn off the Orientation Axes and the Center  
Of Rotation axes from a script run from the built-in PV Python shell?

Thanks,

Message-ID: <C5CC7C3A.875F%kmorel@sandia.gov>

PV 3.4 has a filter called Temporal Interpolation that will linearly interpolate fields and coordinates between time steps.  The one caveat is that the topology cannot change.  That is, the number of points (and their order) must always be the same and the way they are connected to cells must similarly always be the same.

Message-ID: <3e1440e70902270632r216cf275p825fd1e4b4d400ff@mail.gmail.com>

Hello

I imported a STL file into Paraview and I would like to know how to access
the points and cells of the imported polygonal mesh from the python shell.

I have been reading the document "Paraview Scripting with Python" but I
can't figure out how to access data that is already imported in Paraview
with Python.

Is there a way of listing all the created objects already present in the
state?

Thanks for your help

Best regards

Olivier

  Hi

  I'm getting a "Handshake failed" message between 2 machines. They are 
both debian, 64 bit. I have also just retrieved the cvs head, compiled in 
both machines. So, everything points they are the same build. But I'm 
getting this error with the "You are probably using mismatching version". 
Has they are the same versions, must be some other kind of error no?

  Please advise.

Are you sure you updated with cvs up -dAP i.e. don't have any sticky
tags on one (or both) of the machines? Look at
vtkSocketCommunicator::GetVersion (in
ParaView/VTK/Parallel/vtkSockeCommunicator.cxx) are both reporting the
same version number?

Is that a debug build? Can you attach with a debugger and step into
vtkSocketCommunicator::ClientSideHandshake and
vtkSocketCommunicator::ServerSideHandshake and see where it's failing?
If it's not a debug build, adding "cout"s at every location where
these methods return 0 may help.

Hi

  1 - I have "rm -rf ParaView3" before doing the cvs checkout (in both 
machines)

  2 - I compile with RELEASE and flags: -O3 -mtune=native

If you so wish I can compile with debug flags and try to check it. The 
message appears on both sides (on client machine and server machine)

  I can copy-paste the full message if you warrant so

  I can also start a server here and you can see if you are able to 
connect.

  Tell me what you prefer.

  best,

  Ricardo Reis

Can you try adding

cout << __LINE__ << endl;

to every place where 0 is returned in
vtkSocketCommunicator::ClientSideHandshake/vtkSocketCommunicator::ServerSideHandshake
and then compile and send me the result?

Thanks,
Utkarsh

Shall I replace the 0, add the line before the return or right after the 
0?

For instance, here:


   if(!this->SendTagged(&IAmBE, static_cast<int>(sizeof(char)),
       1, vtkSocketController::ENDIAN_TAG, 0))
     {
     if (this->ReportErrors)
       {
       vtkErrorMacro("Endian handshake failed.");
       }
     return 0;
     }

Shall it be like:

   if(!this->SendTagged(&IAmBE, static_cast<int>(sizeof(char)),
       1, vtkSocketController::ENDIAN_TAG, 0))
     {
     if (this->ReportErrors)
       {
       vtkErrorMacro("Endian handshake failed.");
       }

     cout << __LINE__ << endl;
     return 0;
     }

  ?

I have two vtkImageData (one source, one input for the Probe Filter)

DatasetOne (the probe source) has extents [0,31,0,31,0,31] and has one
scalar field
DatasetTwo (the probe input)  has extents [-15,16, -15,16, -15, 16] and
has no PointData or CellData

I am running into several problems:

"Resample with dataset" cannot be connected to DatasetTwo because it is
checking that the Input dataset has a data array to sample. This seems
to be the opposite of what should be enforced. It is the Source dataset
which should be checked for the existence of DataArrays to sample.

Fine, one can get around this and select the Source object, instantiate
a Probe, revert the pre-assigned role of Source being used as Input. So,
I set the source object to be DatasetOne, the input object to be
DatasetTwo. Click apply and the error is:

ERROR: In
/local/apps/ParaView-3.4.0/VTK/Filtering/vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline.cxx,
line 704

vtkCompositeDataPipeline (0x1755b60): The update extent specified in the
information for output port 0 on algorithm
vtkPythonProgrammableFilter(0x17549e0) is 0 31 0 31 0 31, which is
outside the whole extent -15 16 -15 16 -15 16.


What is happening is that the Update Extent of the Source object is
propagated to the Input object, which cannot satisfy the request because
its WholeExtent is outside the range.

That does not seem right to me. One should be able to probe any dataset
with any source, regardless of their relative UpdateExtents. Right or wrong?

I've included a script to replicate this: use "ProbeSource" as Source,
and Probe Input as Input. Click Apply.
