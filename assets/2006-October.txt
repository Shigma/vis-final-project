Hi the list,

I'm playing with pv 2.9 and I noticed some lack of features (in
comparison with release 2.5), etc.

Is it useful to mention them here, or should I wait for a new release ?


Cheers,

Hy !

Making good progress on a simple linux 386 pc, but i'm strikly unable
to show the result on a SGI prism. I can maybe export the results to a
Inventor File to DIsplay it on the big screen,  so my question is  it
possible to export the result into an IV File ?

thank you

Can you run cmake from the command line like this:

Then winzip the binaryDirectory and send it to me?

If yes, where I could get it?

Message-ID: <1159884935.26022.62.camel@localhost.localdomain>

Dear list,


sorry for the long posting to come, but I'd like to introduce to all of
you the result of a MSc. thesis performed here at KTH by Markus
Ringlander, the result is a:

		FASTLIC ALGORITHM CODED IN C++/VTK 
	(... with the goal to be included in ParaView as a filter.)

As opposed to the LEA implementation by Jean Favre, this program can
deal with unstructured (ultimately: triangles), 3D surfaces. For more
details, see:

http://www.ave.kth.se/staff/aero/crippa/lic.html

As of today, the program can't be incorporated in ParaView, due to a
missing texture mapping actor, see:

http://www.ave.kth.se/staff/aero/crippa/lic.html#remaining_issues

Is there somebody at Kitware, or elsewhere that has spent a thought on
how to get this actor into ParaView? 

Just to point out that I/we are not the only ones interested in having
LIC in ParaView, I searched the vtkusers/paraview mailing lists and
found a hit as far back as Dec. 2000 ... where Berk said something about
incorporating LIC implementations made available to him :-) (see below)

Well ... here's our shot:

[vtkusers]/[Paraview]

Markus Ringlander; Sat May 27 20:19:15 EDT 2006

Hi vtk-users,

I will do my MSc thesis in scientific visualization, and specifically
the task is to do Line Integral Convolution (LIC) on unstructured
surface grids in 3D. I am supposed to use VTK for this task. After
having studied the online documentation for VTK, and done searches on
this mailing list, I have a few wonderings I hope someone can shed a
light on. Let me try to explain them.

The basic technique I will use for this 3D surface LIC is to generate
a texture for each polygon in the grid. I have seen examples on a few
texture mappings, where one can assign texture coordinates to vertices
of the polygons building up the grid. In the end one uses
actor-SetTexture(...). But all examples I have seen refer to one
sample image/texture as source.

In my case, I am going to traverse the elements in the grid, and
generate a 2D texture/image for each element. So I will have many
separate textures.

A bit simplified, I was thinking something like this:

1) Read my unstructured grid from a file.
2) Iterate through each polygon in the grid.
3) For each polygon in the iteration, perform the LIC algorithm on it,
which here gives a texture as output for each polygon.
4) Map texture coordinates from this specific image/texture to the
corresponding real world polygon.
5) Back to 3)
6) Output the whole textured grid on the screen.

As I stated earlier, I have only seen examples of a single actor for
texturing, refering to a single image/texture file. In my case I am
wondering if I need to set up an actor for each texture I create? It
can then be over 10,000 textures...

Please help me with some information wheather this is doable in VTK,
and if so, any helpful code snippet for the assignment of the textures
to each polygon.

Thanks!

/Mark

We have an implementation of the Lagrangian Eulerian Advection algorithm 
published at IEEE Vis 2001. It produces LIC images for steady fields and 
time-dependent LIC-like textures with spatial and temporal continuity 
for un-steady fields.

Source code, Makefile and test routines are provided for VTK and ParaView.

Thomas Brandner; Sun Jan 9 05:53:52 EST 2000

Dear  vtk users,

I`m currently working on a study project about line integral convolution
(LIC). 
This is a texture-based technique for effectively displaying 2D and 3D
vector fields.

Has anyone managed to implement this type of filter in vtk ?

As it is to be used  in VR-applications, the focus  is not so much on
accuracy but rather on efficiency to maintain interactivity. 

Thanks very much in advance for any help,
Thomas Brandner

And as far back as Mon Dec 11 10:16:19 EST 2000, Berk said:

LIC, FLIC and spot noise are in my to-do list. I don't know when I can
get to them though. If someone has implementations, I will be happy to
incorporate them to vtk.

We are looking at different options for "spinning-off" the test library

sources are located in the Qt/Testing directory.

Well done,

I corrected a few lines of code because the application had trouble to
read my own data.
I now produced a beautiful image of a LIC on an hypersonic wing dataset.

I'll iterate with the author to send my suggestions to make the code
more robust.

Hi I'm using Paraview 2.2.1. In this release there is an issue with the scalar 
bar when making animations, where the min/max for the lookup table gets sets 
based on data set 0, then as the scalar data evolves over time the scalar bar 
doesn't reflect the changes, so that values outside of the range that existed 
at time zero get clipped in the visualization. I'm wondering if this issue 
has been addressed in the current release?

Ok, let's start with a few.

1) Center of rotation (?) seems to be set to (0,0,0), not to the middle
of the scene, as before. Or am I wrong ?
2) I can't get setting up scalar color bar. Where is it gone ? Clicking
on "Edit Color Map" button only shows
a "Color Map Editor" button.
3) In View menu, where "3D View Properties" item has gone ?
4) I can't get setting label color for OrientationAxes.

Or PV3 is so different that I'm completely lost ?

Hi Fred,

Please describe how to reproduce this bug. (For example: Were you trying 
to color by a component of the vector or by its magnitude?)

Hmm, really don't understand...
I recently rebuild PV2.5 and then, this issue has disappeared !
(some others issues I have noticed, but not mentionned here, have also
disappeared ; really strange.)

So, sorry I can't reproduce this bug ! ;-)
(but the others I have posted here are still here :-(

Thanks anyway, Amy.

Message-ID: <OF518DDC5B.FFAD95C4-ON852571FC.00796C71-852571FC.007ACD68@us.ibm.com>

I'm trying to create a parallel reader and I guess I'm not understanding 
something.  Before going so far as to actually read data, I have a little 
attempt that, on each of 2 parallel servers, creates two orthogonal meshes 
in the output vtkUnstructuredMesh thats passed into its ExecuteData 
method.   It seems to run on both servers; I can put in a gdb breakpoint 
at the ExecuteData entry point, and it gets hit in both cases.   I can 
watch it create the two grids on each node.  I had guessed that the 
reader, on each of the servers, would pass the local data down through 
similar pipelines, which would join when truly parallel filters are 
encountered, and finally join in a IceT sort-last rendering process. 

Unfortunately, it seems that the output of the reader in the MyId = 1 
server is disappearing.  IceT is doing the rendering, I think - rendering 
windows pop up on the two server node's X servers.  But the one on the 
MyId = 1 server remains empty, while the other shows the mesh thats 
created on that server.

So I guess I'm wondering if I have to explicitly gather the data back onto 
the MyId = 0 server and let PV handle redistribution?   Can somebody point 
me at an illuminating document (I have the PV book on order).

Thanks, 
Greg

Greg,
 
Observation: I wouldn't rely on IceT to precisely show you the piece
being renderer on each server. Meaning that's not one of the use cases
we care about... it may not be flipping the back buffer, node 0 may show
an image of  the model already 'composited', etc... you can ask Ken
Moreland for elaboration on the exact characteristics. But in any case
the images that you see on the server side may be misleading...
 
The first thing I would suggest is trying any of the existing 'sources'
or readers that already work in parallel, and then either looking at the
server windows or (the better option given the comment above) running
the 'ProcessIdScalars' filter to color the data by the processor id
thats working on that piece.
 
First Option
1) Source....Sphere...
2) Filter... ProcessIdScalars 
 
Second option is to use any of the existing readers on data that you can
find in VTKData or ParaViewData repositories. pvtp, pvtu, pvtr, etc....
all of these readers/datatypes will 'do the right thing' when run on
multiple processors. After reading in the data you can do the
'ProcessIds' filter.
 
Please let me know if any of these suggestions are helpful.... :)

** Reply Requested When Convenient **

Hello !

After struggling a long time with cave module , i come to the
conclusion that opening more than one display with paraview seems
impossible even tdx=2 crashes 
and using the cave.pvx cave rending module it also crashes or shows up
only on one screen.
So i just have to work on one screen maybe i can try dmx (xinerama wont
work on sgi prism)

Message-ID: <20061004192945.3b896d84.frx@firenze.linux.it>

Hello everybody,
I'm trying to compile Paraview 2.4.4 without building VTK, hdf5, and
TclTk: those libraries are already installed on my system (which is a
Debian sarge box) and I don't want to install another copy just for
Paraview.
I saw that there's a CMake switch to use "system hdf5", and thus tried
to modify the main CMakeLists.txt so that something similar is in place
for VTK and TclTk too.
Unfortunately, no luck so far.

Could you please help me to reach this goal?

If you'd like to see which tries I already did, don't hesitate to ask...

Hi,

this question has been already posted many times (and by myself) here.

The answers were always the same : you can't.

We depend on specific version of VTK and TclTk. To avoid the headache of
debugging version incompatibilities, we make it very hard to use anything
but included version. However, it is possible to use system hdf5. Set
PARAVIEW_USE_SYSTEM_HDF5 to on and set the hdf5 library and headers.

Hmm, I'm not the right person.
Someone else surely could give an answer better than mine.
Or you could look in the ML archive.

But I was told that VTK packaged with PV has some specific features that
"original" VTK does not have.

Not exactly. A release of ParaView does not necessarily align with a release
of VTK. For example, ParaView 2.4.X does not use VTK 5.X. Rather, VTK
included with ParaView 2.4.X is a snapshot from whenever we branched
ParaView to make the release. Actually, we branch VTK together with
ParaView. Therefore, the only VTK version guaranteed to compile and work
with ParaView is the one that comes with it. It is still vanilla VTK though.

I think that was my bad. I was confusing vtk prefixed stuff not in the
VTK directory for pieces of VTK.

Hi Amy,

In fact, as I said in a later post, this is not due to save the session
state.

Look at this:

http://fredantispam.free.fr/snapshot1.jpg

This is the "original" scene, with Outline filter in black.
Note that Outline0 is selected in yellow.

Then if you select say, Contour0, and re-select Outline0, it is white, as
you can see here:

http://fredantispam.free.fr/snapshot2.jpg


Cheers,

This seems to be a significant inconvenience for users, though.

What's the use of dynamic libraries ("shared objects"), if every
application ships with its own copy of the needed libraries?
It's unnecessary code duplication on the target system and makes Unix
systems go one step in the direction of a situation similar to the
so-called "DLL hell" (which is typically found in Windows systems).

I can understand recommending particular VTK and TclTk releases and
stating that any other combination is untested, but deliberately making
it hard to link against already installed libraries does not sound
right...


As an aside, I suspect that this is one of the reasons why nobody has
yet successfully packaged Paraview for inclusion in the official Debian
archive[1]: it's probably unacceptable not to link against libraries
(such as VTK and Tcl/Tk) that are already packaged for Debian, unless
there are very good reasons not to do so...

[1] despite the interest that some users have expressed for such a
package: there's an open RFP (Request For Package) bug about Paraview

Can CMake find VTK in Paraview? Specifically if CMake finds ParaView
will that satisfy a "FIND_PACKAGE(VTK REQUIRED)"?

Let me try to explain better:

* The latest official release of VTK is 5.0.
* ParaView does not work with VTK 5.0 (we have made changes, additions and
bug fixes to VTK since then).
* It is too much work and also too complicated to release a special VTK for
ParaView. We have documentation, books and other support products that have
to match the VTK release.
* We do not want to be bound to an official release of VTK because ParaView
releases are much more often than VTK releases
* Next time we make a release (ParaView 2.6 in November), we will branch
VTK. We will not create an official VTK release. 5.2 will probably be much
later.
* Debian and other distributions should use the latest official VTK release

When ParaView release cycle slows down and can match VTK's in the future, we
will consider synchronizing the two. As for Tk, we are switching to Qt and
we will not include Qt in the ParaView source. Therefore, it will be
possible to link against an external Qt.

As for Debian packages,  it should be possible to include the VTK that
ParaView needs in such a package. If the issue is naming conflicts, we can
change the cmake scripts to name ParaView's VTK libraries appropriately to
avoid conflicts.

Hi,

I have cell centered data which I load into paraview-2.4.4.
 From the cell centered data I apply the CellToPoint filter.
Then, I try to make a stream from that data. I get an error in the 
executable terminal:

Does anyone know how I can fix this?

Thanks,

Let me clarify: IANADD (I Am Not A Debian Developer), so I'm not
absolutely sure, but I think the issue would not be naming conflicts[1],
but lack of proper modularization.
Having a second VTK version in Debian would mean extra work to do, but
could be manageable (if there are good reasons).  What I think would be
seen as problematic is having to package Paraview *together* with its
needed VTK (that is, in the same source package).


[1] the issue can be handled in a sane way: there are already cases of
libraries that are packaged for Debian in multiple versions; for
instance, Debian sarge includes tcl8.0, tcl8.3, and tcl8.4

No, not really. I was just thinking that since ParaView is VTK +
ParaView you might want only ParaView. All the shared libraries will be
there, right? The only trouble that jumps to my mind is that other
projects that require VTK and are configured with CMake might know that
they have a perfectly good VTK if they have ParaView.

Message-ID: <200610051147.18573.pjb9508@vashon.ca.boeing.com>

We have engineers using a numerical method that doesn't uniquely define values 
at vertices.  For example, if five cells all share a common vertex, then 
generally you can expect five different values at the common vertex.  The 
data is represented as polynomials of arbitrary order.  The data is 
discontinuous across cell faces and edges (a.k.a. discontinuous galerkin 
method).   This is probably very similar to some FE codes so perhaps someone 
already has experience with this type of problem.  

The question is if it becomes necessary to accurately visualize the data, what 
is the best way of doing this?  You could have multiple vertices at the same 
location, one for each cell, but this doesn't take care of the problem of the 
non-linear functions within each cell.  There is a paper (Sandia?) outlining 
a metnod of recursively subdividing each cell by searching for critical 
points first in the interior, then the faces, edges, .etc.   The method has 
already been implemented in VTK.  However, it's not clear that this would 
work in this case.  The opinion of the engineers who use this code is that it 
will not work.  

My thinking is that using programmable shaders (and adding the functionality 
to PV) would be the best solution.  Any opinions?  How much time/effort/$$$ 
would it take to implement this.   Thanks in advance

I've only seen DG techniques that have discontinuities at element
boundaries. Techniques that have interior discontinuities (xFEM) usually
model the discontuity as a sheet of some implicit function over the
interior, correct? If so, then using this sheet to divide each element
into pieces and rendering the results seems like a good way to proceed
with the analysis.

That is correct. The search for critical points assumes the function is
a smooth polynomial over the domain's interior; discontinuities are only
allowed on element boundaries and would be modeled as you stated above
(i.e., separate vertices and higher-order degrees-of-freedom for each
element).

As far as visualization, that seems the best route. If you are looking
to do other post-processing/analysis, then maybe not. ParaView already
has the option to use custom shaders but there is not a way to specify
per-cell constants to the shader (the last time I looked, anyway). So,
it would involve writing a new painter class that loaded per-cell
information about the polynomial interpolant just before each cell is
rendered. The time/effort/money involved depends on the complexity of
the interpolant and how the discontinuities are defined. This is
something I plan on doing at some point but don't have time to
currently.

What about projects that aren't configured with CMake?

Anyway, my situation is different: I already have VTK, Tcl/Tk, and so
forth, installed on my system, because those libraries are part of
Debian and are required by other packages I previously installed.
Adding another copy of those libraries would be a waste of disk space
(and my hard disk is not too large...).

1. You need not perform subdivision at all if (over a single cell) the
approximation is trilinear. I haven't seen commercial DG solvers do
anything but trilinear interpolation, so you should be fine just by
repeating vertices in the mesh so that each cell can have unique nodal
values.

2. If you have quadratic interpolants within a cell, ParaView's existing
tessellation filter will most probably suit your needs. By forcing a
single subdivision along each axis (r, s, and t), you'll capture the
behavior of the interpolant properly with the resulting linear
approximation.

3. If you have interpolants that are higher order than quadratic, you'll
need to develop a mesh adaptor (? la the vtkBridgeDataSet
http://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkBridgeDataSet.html). A
version of the tessellation filter is in ParaView so that you can create
a linear approximation. Sandia has some code (not in ParaView yet) that
locates critical points and creates more accurate approximations, but
what's there is most probably fine for your needs.

My 2 cents.

(I also use Debian).

1) My paraview is statically linked with all VTK libs;
2) I checked "BUILD_SHARED_LIBS" to on. I guess if you uncheck it, you
won't have VTK libs installed on your HD.

Subject: [Paraview] Quantitative analysis in Paraview III and XY plot
Message-ID: <200610061007.40327.francois.beaubert@univ-valenciennes.fr>

Hi all,

In the annoucement of Paraview III, one of the goal of this release will be an 
emphasis on quantitative analysis.

I have a few questions on XY plot and perhaps may suggest some wishes.
Is there any plans to develop an XY plot module that can support the following 
features and in particular precise control of graph features such as:

* major and minor thichmarks (in/out, thickness, length, etc )
* grid control of the plot (dot, line, thickness)
* customizable colors
* different dashed line styles
* different fill patterns
* different marker symbols with different Color/fill markers
* text annotations with subscripts, superscripts and symbols or LaTeX and 
richtext label support
* legends of the graphs
* curve Fitting
* data set operations: evaluating expressions and direct editing of data
* free or pan zooming, masking of data points and marker
* every object can be dragged by mouse

Whaou, the new Qt interface is a dream !
Thanks
Francois

There will be a much improved Qt line plot widget in ParaView 3. I don't
know exactly which features it supports right now but it will be close to
what you describe. It should appear on CVS soon.

Hi Christian,

Can you post your findings to the mailing list so that they can be archived?
You might also want to update the wiki. We have not been working on the cave
enough to be able to help people.

Hi Fred,

This is a know issue that also drives me crazy :-) Hopefully, we will fix it
relatively soon.

2) I can't get setting up scalar color bar. Where is it gone ? Clicking
> on "Edit Color Map" button only shows

a "Color Map Editor" button.


You can do it now. There are two ways of doing it in the current release. Go
to the display tab, like paraview 2.  Or right click on a source and bring
up the display properties.


> 3) In View menu, where "3D View Properties" item has gone ?
> 4) I can't get setting label color for OrientationAxes.


Try Edit -> Settings _after_ you create a view. The view settings is per
view. New views inherit the settings of the last view. We will re-organize
the location of these menu commands.

Or PV3 is so different that I'm completely lost ?


It is not completely different but there are some differences. Some of these
is to fix mistakes we made in paraview 2, some of them are to support new
features like multiple views, plot views etc...

Subject: [Paraview] October snapshot of ParaView III
Message-ID: <4526611C.3040007@kitware.com>

Hi Folks,

I posted the October snapshot of ParaView III. The download links and 
announcemets for all snapshots cam be found at:
http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView_III_snapshots

This snapshot includes binaries for Windows, Linux (32 and 64 bit) and Mac OS X. 
I did not post the source because the CVS repository is now open to anonymous 
access (yey!). Follow the instructions on the page to checkout the source from CVS.

New features to look for include:

* Addition of Display and Information tabs similar to ParaView 2. We are still 
trying to decide what to do with these pages so the way they work may change in 
the future. It is still possible to access the statistics page from 
View->Statistics View and the display page from the contextual menu of 
individual pipeline elements (right click -> Display Settings). We would love 
feedback on this.
* Layout and geometry is not stored at exit and restored at startup.
* Improved property pages for readers and filters
* Preliminary support for plots. The first plot view we added is a bar plot 
view. This is used only for histograms. To try it out, follow these steps:
    - Create a sphere from the sources menu
    - Apply the histogram filter (Filters->Test->ExtractHistogram)
    - Create a histogram view (Edit->Add Plot->Histogram)
    - Select the new view by clicking on it
    - Turn the visibility of the histogram filter on by clicking on the eye icon
We are working on making this process simpler :-)

There is still very little documentation. Look at
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView_III to get more information on the new
features. We will continue adding more documentation to this page as we progress.

Enjoy.

ParaView3.0.conf is the file in ~/.config/Kitware/

I would know if there are other settings I could put in this file
(dimensions, position of the pv3 window, for example).
Or which are all settings for Kitware.

Ah, I understand. That file is designed to be internal. We will have other
ways of specifying settings. What settings are you interested in setting?

I could use qtconfig but it does not configure such things.

ParaView remembers dimension and layout from last time now. Is that not
enough?

Yes, now, it is. :-)
PV 2.9.4 was building when I posted.
Now, it has finished.
And that works fine.

Thanks.

I still can not view the labels of OrientationAxes :-(
(no editing menu for color labels)

Moreover, opacity < 1seems to not render correctly.

Anyway, this release is much better than september's ;-)
Thanks a lot.

Maybe, but I guess that I would get a big statically linked Paraview
executable, which I'd rather avoid...

Hello,

I am using MSVS 2003 SP1 and QT 4.1.4. When I try to compile the code from
CVS after building the project with CMAKE I get the followings 22 errors.
It seems to be missing one of the QT libraries or something? Any
suggestions? Is this the right version of QT to be using?

Sincerely,

Joseph Hennessey

Subject: [Paraview] installing ParaView on AIX 
Message-ID: <4526F7C0.3010804@coas.oregonstate.edu>

So far:
I downloaded the'AIX'  binary Cmake files and theParaView sources files.
I've 'configured' and 'generated' with ccmake. Not with a lot of 
confidence, as I guessed at a path definition
for one of the GL variables and removed a "const" from H5Zpkg.h to get 
ccmake to finish.
[Hint: it would be nice to confirm that my ccmake parameters are set 
correctly]
I'm now working on building ParaView with 'make', resulting in 
objections to the AIX stdio.h file , spec.
"fgetpos64" has non-C++ linkage".
Anyone  completed this process?
Laura

I have a short question too... I am would like to try it the
other way around.
Would it be possible to use paraview vtk installation to
write some vtk (e.g. using tcl) programs without an
installation of an separate VTK installation? Right now, I
think it should be possible to set the vtk path to paraviews
directory and all should be fine; at least with linux!?

Greetings!
Fabian

Hello everybody,
I don't know if it is too early to mention it but I'm trying to read a
Ensight case that works fine with 2.4 in 2.9.3 (October) and I keep
getting errors.
?Is the ensight reader supposed to be working already?
The process I'm following is:
1 File/open
2 built in server, connect
3 select the .case file, Ok
then I get the following error:

ERROR: In
C:\berk\work\ParaView3-release\VTK\IO\vtkGenericEnSightReader.cxx, line 264

I have notice that the CaseFileName box in the Object Inspector to the
left is empty so I try again to put the case file there by:
click on ... , select the file and Ok.
Then I click accept in the object inspector.
Then I get the following error message:

ERROR: In

I have also tried the example data in this format that comes with
version 2.4 just in case it would be something wrong with my case. It
problem is the same.
If this is known and it is still a reader in development just ignore my
post, but I thought it could be useful to you guys if it is supposed to
be working.
later,

Did you mean 2.9.3 (Septemeber) or 2.9.4 (October).
It works for me in 2.9.4, but not 2.9.3.

Sorry for the misunderstanding. In fact, I had the intention of 
downloading and installing 2.9.4 and, by mistake :-[ , I got 2.9.3. Of 
course, I did not even pay attention to what version I was installing 
and thus the error.
However, with version 2.9.4 in windows I still get errors. I'm 
reproducing them bellow

The situation is closer to work (I think) becouse now it does recognize 
the data in the case as the variables appear in the object inspector.

Message-ID: <200610091115327503911@163.com>

Hi,all,

I want to insert a writer into my simulation program to output the data in compressed .vts format.
I first compressed the raw data with zlib-1.2.3, and then encoded the compressed data in base64, and then
listed it inside the DataArray element of .vts file. 
But, when I open this .vts file by Paraview, there is error that says "Error reading beginning of compression header.
Read 0 of 12 bytes".

Who can give me a compressed .vts file writer or tell me how to write this writer?

Dear Paraviewers,

I really like the way paraview is evolving, and I'd like to try 
developping new readers and filters for it.

When will we be able to create our own filters/readers like in pv2.x (with 
only xml files?)
I am a little worried because I can't see the equivalent of KWWidget in 
qt...

greetings!
Stephane

Try to write your data with  "Ensight gold" file format,

You 'll find more documentation and you can have several parts and time 
variation.

It works really well for me
ftp://ftp.legi.hmg.inpg.fr/pub/MONTESINO_Stephane/visu/

If  you have trouble writing your data with this format and need help, 
just ask.

Just a note regarding the Ensight's format (which is the file format that I
also like to use with PV - for me, it's the easiest the most powerful
format).

The problem when using Ensight's format with PV is that some features are
not fully supported in newer releases. I'm still using PV 2.2.1 because some
feaures does not work well in the later releases (2.4.x) when the data is
loaded from Ensight's readers.

some missing features that I already noted:

- Clean to grid (which removes the parallel communication interface by
merging coincident nodes)
- Volume rendering animation
- Lookmarks (always crash when using Ensight's format)

By the way, does anybody already got success in loading Ensight's data in PV
2.9.x? I only got some error messages point to Berk's directories. I guess,
the binaries distributed were compiled with absolute directory paths which
inherited the Berk's path ;o)

Have you tried to use the features that I listed after loading Ensight's
data?

for me, the most annoying feature is that the "clean to grid" filter does
not work well in PV 2.4.x. In PV 2.2.1 I can load several pieces of a
parallel model, glue all together with the "append datasets" (or even load
the entire model using a SOS file) and clean the communication interfaces
with the "clean to grid" filter. Another feature that would be interesting
is the volume rendering animation. I'm only able to produce some snapshots.

Stephane:
 
ParaView3 can create "panels" automatically based on the contents of the server manager XML, which allows you to focus on creating filters instead of writing UI.  You also have the option to create custom panels using varying combinations of C++, Qt, and Qt designer if an auto-generated panel doesn't meet your needs.

	When will we be able to create our own filters/readers like in pv2.x (with only xml files?) 
	I am a little worried because I can't see the equivalent of KWWidget in qt... 
	
	greetings! 
	Stephane

Please ignore this unless you work at Kitware.

===  Bug #1

"Internal server error" is returned when I use

http://www.kitware.com/search.html

to do a search of the ParaView pages with options

   match all
   format long
   sort score
   keyword batch

=== Bug #2

It gets better! The server error message says to inform kitware@kitware.com but that message yields this mystery:

Subject: [Paraview] Batch, X and MPI
Message-ID: <8784A3447075C0037C085648@harpo.psc.edu>

I'd like to run pvbatch on a system that doesn't have an X server. It seems like this should work since the CMake flags were set to use Mesa.

However, pvbatch fails in vtkXOpenGLRenderWindow.cxx with the message "bad X server".

On that same system pvserver works just fine, with either compositing or with rendering at the client.

Should pvbatch be even looking for an X server? If not then could someone suggest a few CMake settings to adjust?

On a releated note ...

Can pvbatch run in parallel? I've made 2 sets of PV binaries, with and without MPI. pvbatch is present in the bin directory in both cases.

System: HP/Compaq/DEC Tru64; a great many Alpha processors

A few values from CMakeCache.txt (non-mpi version):

OSMESA_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=/usr/lib/libOSMesa.so
VTK_OPENGL_HAS_OSMESA:BOOL=ON
VTK_USE_MANGLED_MESA:BOOL=OFF

Ok, I've found the problem.

vtkGenericEnSightReader.cxx line 546 assumes a unix directory separator ( / ).
And the filename has Windows directory separators ( \ ), so that piece of code 
gets skipped, and cannot find elements.geo.

Thanks for the reply,

>>ParaView3 can create "panels" automatically based on the contents of the 
server manager XML, which allows you to focus on creating filters instead 
of writing UI.  You also have the option to >>create custom panels using 
varying combinations of C++, Qt, and Qt designer if an auto-generated 
panel doesn't meet your needs.

I looked some more into the code, and it appears that we have to modify 
the source code (or the source xml files) if we want to add any new filter 
: 
My conclusions come from the fact that panels are generated as static Qt 
interfaces (cf comment in pqObjectPanelLoader.h), and the xml files are 
included into the vtkSMGeneratedModules.h file, which is the only file 
used to initialize the application ( the method addConfigurationFile is 
never called). 
Will we have the possibility to dynamically import package (via the menu 
or the env variables)?

The other point is that I can't find a xml file for the client as those 
that where in the old GUI/Client/Resources dir. 
You say that the interface is generated from the SM xml, that means that 
we can't choose specify the GUI other than by coding it in C++/Qt? 
What are the Qt/Components/Resources/XML/... files for?

Many questions, because I am really interested by what you are doing on 
Paraview3 ;-)

I have managed this morning to integrate our CFX reader into ParaQ (or 
Paraview III - which name is the official one?). Inside 
ParaViewReaders.xml you can add a brief name="myReader" and this can 
refer to the name in the provided servermanager XML file which is the 
same as for Paraview OLD. As you correctly discovered, the 
paraviewreaders.xml is bound into the ui resources of the mainwindow and 
so you need to regenerate/rebuild the qt interface.
using the PARAVIEW_EXTERNAL_MODULES to include our modules at build time 
- they are linked in and working. (I always used this method in the past 
because when you tried to dynamically load modules at run time, they 
never worked in parallel (for me))

The clever bit is that with no Client xml file used, it was able to 
create this panel!

This is going to save so much time. Thank you very much for adding this

Actually. It seems to be bound into pqComponents and you need to touch a 
.ui file in there to make it regenerate.

I keep seeing that a display is looked for unless VTK_USE_OFFSCREEN is
set. This option only becomes available after either the OSMesa library
is found or the mangled Mesa library is found.

I, and I think some other people, have had some trouble with this
option.

Yes, and it's AWESOME. It saved me DAYS on some volume rendered movies I
made. Brian Wylie set me straight a while back on the vtk list. Take a

Thanks for these infos, I managed to get my reader on.

For those interested, the file you need to touch to recompile the 
ParaViewReaders.xml file into pqComponents is the pqResources.qrc file

Wow that's great!
So, I'm a newbie and I want to understand how Paraview works doing this
parallel volume rendering... The approach used is a client/server
separation, load balancing is achieved by a kd tree (D3) distrbution and the
final image is composited by the server hardware alpha blending... Am I
right?
Is MPI used?
It's possible that the ordered compositing uses the Sandia's IceT library?

Cheers
Mario

Hi all,
Testing paraview2.9.4alpha downloaded today
on an intel macbook pro, core duo (dual core chip, 2CPU), 2Gb ram
OSX 10.4.8

open .vti jpeg image 3D data file (about 30 MBytes)

use CleanUnstructuredGrid

then can use
display - Volume render

this thinks for a while and then crashes the paraview.app
with the following error message.
Maybe some memory error?
My RAM has been tested recently, so that shouldn't be the cause.

Is this a known bug?

cheers

Wow that's great!
So, I'm a newbie and I want to understand how Paraview works doing this
parallel volume rendering... The approach used is a client/server
separation, load balancing is achieved by a kd tree (D3) distrbution and
the final image is composited by the server hardware alpha blending...
Am I right? 
Is MPI used? 
It's possible that the ordered compositing uses the Sandia's IceT
library?


Cheers
Mario

ccmake was run, the flag was set to on, and cmake was asked to regenerate the make files. I verified that the flag was on by looking at CMakeCache.txt and reran make. But I still get the message

======
ERROR: In /usr/local/packages/paraview/2.4.4/src/VTK/Rendering/vtkXOpenGLRenderWindow.cxx, line 477
vtkXOpenGLRenderWindow (141757600): bad X server connection.

I thought that pvbatch was fixed over a year ago so that it didn't need an X server. Have I perhaps missed some other flag?

This has become an urgent problem here and any advice would be much appreciated.

I must admit to not being an expert. I think I have offscreen rendering
all figured out, everything works for a while, then I mess something up
and I can't remember how it all worked.

I do know of a work around though, you can as a regular user run virtual
X servers. This is how cron runs my VTK and ParaView tests.

Subject: [Paraview] Multiblock support in ParaView
Message-ID: <1160554432.15412.53.camel@beaker.ran.sandia.gov>

Berk,

	I am having a problem with Extract Dataset filter in ParaView when it's
run on "multiblock of multiblock" datasets. It's not that anything is
broken... but it keeps me from getting at some of the data; because
Extract Dataset shows only one level of children and always returns a
multiblock dataset with the same structure as the original (with only
the selected children present), there's no way for me to extract the
child of a child dataset.

	Here's an example: by default, the LSDynaReader (checkin coming later
tonight :-), writes a multiblock dataset containing a mesh for each of
the possible LSDyna cell types:

vtkMultiBlockDataSet with 1 groups. (0x2065c90)
  Group 0 has 5 children:
    NULL entry
    vtkMultiBlockDataSet with 1 groups. (0x21e8d00)
      Group 0 has 1 children:
        vtkUnstructuredGrid with 8560 points and 1 cells.
    vtkMultiBlockDataSet with 1 groups. (0x2221520)
      Group 0 has 1 children:
        vtkUnstructuredGrid with 8560 points and 288 cells.
    NULL entry
    vtkMultiBlockDataSet with 1 groups. (0x2274280)
      Group 0 has 1 children:
        vtkUnstructuredGrid with 8560 points and 5671 cells.

For this case, Extract Dataset filter works fine. However, when I turn
on an option to split each grid into pieces based on the material IDs of
the cells, the LSDyna reader outputs a multiblock dataset containing
other multiblock datasets like so:

vtkMultiBlockDataSet with 1 groups. (0x2065c90)
  Group 0 has 5 children:
    NULL entry
    vtkMultiBlockDataSet with 1 groups. (0x26ba650)
      Group 0 has 8 children:
        vtkUnstructuredGrid with 8560 points and 0 cells.
        vtkUnstructuredGrid with 8560 points and 0 cells.
        vtkUnstructuredGrid with 8560 points and 1 cells.
        vtkUnstructuredGrid with 8560 points and 0 cells.
        vtkUnstructuredGrid with 8560 points and 0 cells.
        vtkUnstructuredGrid with 8560 points and 0 cells.
        vtkUnstructuredGrid with 8560 points and 0 cells.
        vtkUnstructuredGrid with 8560 points and 0 cells.
    vtkMultiBlockDataSet with 1 groups. (0x27b3b90)
      Group 0 has 8 children:
        vtkUnstructuredGrid with 8560 points and 0 cells.
        vtkUnstructuredGrid with 8560 points and 288 cells.
        vtkUnstructuredGrid with 8560 points and 0 cells.
        vtkUnstructuredGrid with 8560 points and 0 cells.
        vtkUnstructuredGrid with 8560 points and 0 cells.
        vtkUnstructuredGrid with 8560 points and 0 cells.
        vtkUnstructuredGrid with 8560 points and 0 cells.
        vtkUnstructuredGrid with 8560 points and 0 cells.
    NULL entry
    vtkMultiBlockDataSet with 1 groups. (0x2904e90)
      Group 0 has 8 children:
        vtkUnstructuredGrid with 8560 points and 2892 cells.
        vtkUnstructuredGrid with 8560 points and 0 cells.
        vtkUnstructuredGrid with 8560 points and 0 cells.
        vtkUnstructuredGrid with 8560 points and 81 cells.
        vtkUnstructuredGrid with 8560 points and 420 cells.
        vtkUnstructuredGrid with 8560 points and 2112 cells.
        vtkUnstructuredGrid with 8560 points and 64 cells.
        vtkUnstructuredGrid with 8560 points and 102 cells.

Now I can run Extract Dataset once and eliminate some of the unwanted
meshes, but I can't run a second Extract Dataset on the result to gain
access to an individual grandchild mesh. While I could work around this
by eliminating the middle man meshes (to mix metaphors), the hierarchy
is easier to create and makes more sense in terms of the user interface.
So, do you think the Extract Dataset filter could be modified to
- Remove one level of "multiblockness" each time it is run, or
- Show the entire hierarchy and allow any subset to be selected?

	Thanks,

Hi,
            I am trying to color an isosurface with a different data 
variable. Please point me where I can find how this can be done? I have a 
geometry and a scalar field, I am trying to color the geometry with the 
scalar field.

Thanks

Hi,
With Ensight Gold file format and Paraview 2.4.2
I put the data used to generate the geometry (isosurface) and the data 
to color the isosurface in the same .case file

For instance, the case file looks like this:

This problem was added to the bug list on 6/14/2005 (#1935) and is still present in 2.4.4. It looks like the keyframe descriptions are already present in the batch script made by paraview.

Has anyone figured out what to add to the batch script to run throught the animation and generate frames?

Thanks!

Locate the pvTemp* variable assigned to the AnimationScene proxy as under:

   set pvTemp28 [$proxyManager NewProxy animation AnimationScene]

at the end of the batch file but before:
   $proxyManager UnRegisterProxies

add:
   pvTemp28 Play ;# to play the animation.

pvTemp28 is vtkSMAnimationSceneProxy, so you can call any other method 
on it as well, such as SaveImages.

Utkarsh,

As per your suggestion (at the bottom of this message) I added this call to the pvb file created by paraview 2.4.4 (running on Redhat Linux Fedora Core 5 and a Pentium 4):

   $pvTemp115 SaveImages test jpg 1920 1080 5 90

For testing, I ran pvbatch directly, on my workstation. The script creates a sphere; cuts it; and then animations the offset for the cut. Here's the output:

======
$ pvbatch anim.pvb
Process SphereSource [...........]
Process PVClipDataSet [...........]
Process DataSetSurfaceFilter [...........]
Segmentation fault (core dumped)

Here is some information from gdb, edited a little for readability. Note that the value of "this" at level #0 is null!

Subject: [Paraview] Compiling PV with Visual Studio 2005
Message-ID: <000d01c6ee52$b482d580$6500a8c0@neutron>

 
Hi folks,

does anybody already got success in compiling PV with Visual Studio 2005? 

The compilation runs fine (within the IDE or with NMAKE -- I already tried
both methods) but when I try to run the binary produced I got an error
message related to "MSVCR80.dll not found". 

After looking for answers with Google I found a bunch of people getting the
same kind of problem with other applications but I haven't found any
solution effective yet. Maybe, I should try a "downgrade" in my Visual
Studio from 2005 to 2003 which always worked fine for me ;o)

Thanks for any help.

Renato.

Message-ID: <8D6309F95A065249918E4B5FA1A45E140199BF63@naeanrfkez03>

Hi-

I'm running a CVS snapshot from 20 Sept of Paraview 2.5, compiled with
mpich-gm, Mesa-6.5.1 and off-screen rendering enabled in cmake.  I also
have a version compiled with mesa and off-screen but without mpi.

I start paraview as follows:

/paraview-cvs-mesa-nompi/bin/pvclient -rc

/paraview-cvs-mesa-mpi/bin/pvserver -rc -ch=headnode
--use-offscreen-rendering

If I un-check the "compositing" box in the GUI, which as I understand
things, disables compositing and does all rendering on the head node,
paraview runs fine.

However, if I turn compositing on, the SERVERS crash immediately if any
data is loaded for display, and I get a message from the client which
informs me that connection to the server has been lost.  There are no
X-related errors in stdout or stderr - only a message which gives an
error in the vtk server connector.

Is this likely a bug or a configuration problem?

I have trouble getting paraview to run through an entire sequence and

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview performance
Message-ID: <45326A95.10409@cognitdesign.com>

I have a question regarding paraview performance. I'm using paraview to 
visualize CFD results. The results are written in ensight format as 
ascii. I have been doing some work on a model with a unstructured mesh 
of about 1.5 million cells. Using simply a clip filter cutting with a 
scalar takes a lot of time. It is not big for just a frame but we are 
calculating 20 time steps. If we want to calculate that cliping (to find 
a free surface) to create an animation it takes about 15 or 20 minutes. 
The machine is an AMD athlon with  4 GB.
We are interested in processing a calculation with around 5 million 
cells. We have tried and it takes hours.
Is there a way of improving this performance through some settings or 
similar?
Does having the results written in ascii (it takes quite some room) have 
some effect on performance?

I have tried to open the results with 4.5 million cells and it is taking 
hours. So far, the computer has been trying to open the data file for 2 
hours. Is there a way of doing this on a single computer? I assumed that 
paraview was indicated for large dataset, is this possible only on a 
parallel configuration?

What kind of rendering are you doing?

For volume rendering (and isosurface generation), HAVS can render up  
to 6 million tets/sec on the latest graphics hardware (single machine).

HAVS has recently been added to Paraview, and is also available stand  
alone:

Even for a simple solid rendering. I'm trying to open a case with 4.5 
million and its been working for 6 hours now. Is it normal to have that 
kind of performance if the data is in ascii? Granted the geo file is big 
(4Gb) but I thought it could be handled.
I'm going to check out HAVS. Thanks for the suggestion.

One way of pinpointing  the bottleneck is to look at Window -> Timer Log. I
am guessing IO is the problem here. However, clip filter might be also
taking a long time with 4.5 million cells on 1 processor.  I recommend
switching to at least binary. A 4.5 Gb ascii file is ridiculous. A format
that supports compression like the VTK-XML formats might also help. Also,
are you using the cut or clip filter?

You can write a tcl/java/python vtk script to do this. Assuming that you are
using the legacy .vtk format,  create a vtkDataSetReader connected to a
vtkDataSetWriter in your program. I recommend reading the VTK documentation
and/or asking the VTK mailing list. In the future, we will add support for
setting writer options in paraview.

It sounds like you have to create a custom animation. Look at the
instructions here:
http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView:AnimationTutorial

Can you provide more information about the crash? It would be nice if you
could save an animation at a single shot :-)

It sounds like a configuration problem. Can you post the X errors? I am
guessing the server does not have access to an X display or  one that
supports GLX. Also, can you post your CMakeCache.txt?

I'm using the clip filter.
The reason for using ensigth is the support for time steps. It seems a 
lot harder to create the same thing in vtk format. The calculation also 
includes mesh deformation and it seemed easier in ensigth.
I'll check the log to see what is taking so long. However, with the big 
model I can not even open it, it?s taking 8 hours now.

My 2 cents.

Are you sure you do not swap ?

32 or 64 bits OS ?

I think Fred has a point. The problem might be less of rendering  
speed, and more of I/O swapping due to lack of memory.

If you have only a 32 bits OS, you can only access to 2 GB, even if you
have 4 GB of RAM.

Perhaps I'm not understanding your question, but if you're able to name the 
files with sequential numbers:

filename_0001.jpg
filename_0002.jpg
..

then in the worst case Gimp can be used to easily create an animation from the 
sequence of images.

Hello-   I'm getting an error both when I try to read in a pvs (saved state)

Along with the error is a segmentation fault and paraview crashes.
Anyone familiar with this?  I attach an example of one of the pvs files
that won't read in and also the trace file written as it crashes.
Any help greatly appreciated-   Greg

Subject: [Paraview] Unable to generate animations with pvbatch (repost)
Message-ID: <4E22E29EADDC0D77D6BD723E@harpo.psc.edu>

Utkarsh,

As per your suggestion (at the bottom of this message) I added this call to the pvb file created by paraview 2.4.4 (running on Redhat Linux Fedora Core 5 and a Pentium 4):

   $pvTemp115 SaveImages test jpg 1920 1080 5 90

For testing, I ran pvbatch directly, on my workstation. The script creates a sphere; cuts it; and then animations the offset for the cut. Here's the output:

======
$ pvbatch anim.pvb
Process SphereSource [...........]
Process PVClipDataSet [...........]
Process DataSetSurfaceFilter [...........]
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
======

Here is some information from gdb, edited a little for readability. Note that the value of "this" at level #0 is null!

when I build with Visual Studio 2005, I have only errors about libmpich.a.lib that cannot open.

are my settings all ok?!
what library I had to choose for MPI_LIBRARY?!

Well, you nailed it here: KWWidgets is obviously 
not as full featured as wxWidgets or Qt, which I 
think you can use from Python the way you 
described. But it provides nice widgets that can 
be interfaced to VTK objects very easily, and 
that are likely to take a lot of time to recode. 
Now trust me if I'm telling you that recoding 
those widgets will take wayyyyyy longer than 
using an intermediate class for your callbacks./


The comment above by Sebastien prompts me to ask:

Is there a plan to migrate the volume-rendering widgets used in ParaView 2.x to ParaView III?
If recoding these widgets takes "wayyyyyy too long", are there ready-made Qt widgets with the same functionality:

I mean vtkKWVolumePropertyWidget, with color transfer and opacity transfer editors?

Just curious

I have a Paraview source module thats connected to an external process by 
a socket.  When that process sees fit, it will send a message to the 
source module that new data is ready.  It will then pass the data over, 
and the source module will grab it.  On the next RequestData, the source 
module will update its outputs with the new data.  Unfortunately, I can't 
seem to figure out how to trigger the pipeline (maybe I don't have the 
right terminology here) to cause the pipeline to run and the render window 
to update. 

One complication is that I'm in client/server mode, and right now the 
client is not connected to the external process, just the source modules 
that run in the server processes.

Can anybody give me an idea of how this should be done?  I'm new to PV 
(and have the book on order).  I could be going at this all wrong, for all 
I know.
 
Thanks.

Message-ID: <16DB97C40BCDDD7AD21C48F6@harpo.psc.edu>

The answer to Greg's question would also be helpful to us.

We are running an application on a parallel system and would like to use ParaView to monitor its output in real time.

The app will be writing time steps (where each is a set of files, one from each processor) directly to the Linux PC where ParaView is running. ParaView will be reading these files via a pvd file that describes all the time steps including the ones not
yet written by the app.

However, we are missing one critical piece: how do we coax ParaView to notice that the next time step (i.e., the next set of files) has arrived - and to go read them?

The most elegant solution to this, and Greg's question, would be to identify, in the server, something like a background loop, and then add a call to a new routine (that we write) that looks for our special event (a message, a new file, whatever) and
then kicks off a change.

Unfortunately, I can't post the errors or the CMakeCache.txt.  I'm
hoping to have another machine to run on in a week or so.
 
However, in this particular case, there are no "X" errors.  There is a
vtk-paraview error regarding a failed server connection, and then the
application abruptly quits.
 
However, I'm a little confused.  If I'm using a Mesa enabled server,
with off screen enabled at compile time and on the command line, should
I need an X server?

	It sounds like a configuration problem. Can you post the X
errors? I am guessing the server does not have access to an X display or
one that supports GLX. Also, can you post your CMakeCache.txt?

Berk et al, (I've cross posted this to paraview/visit and kwwidgets, but 
it'll probably bounce as I'm not subscribed to kwwidgets and I think the

I'd just like to note that the GUI widgets for volume rendering in Visit 
are extremely nice. I have successfully <cough> "lifted" the Gaussian 
editor control (part of the opacity transfer function editor) from visit 
to use in my own Qt application - it was a Qt3->Qt4 change plus some 
tweaks to remove dependencies. The entire volume rendering widget would 
be a lot more work, but in my opinion well worth it - because it is very 
good. I am willing to volunteer to port the entire volume property 
control set from visit since I need it anyway.
Note that the visit license was recently changed to remove any 
commercial usage restrictions and I believe is compatible with paraview now.

If it is possible to make the widgets shareable between visit/paraview 
it'd be very useful. However since visit is qt3 and paraview qt4 this 
might mean an excessive amount of #ifdefs etc. I mentioned this to one 
of the visit people a little while ago and they said that sharing had 
been "discussed" at some point, but no action had been taken.

Can anyone provide more information?

Message-ID: <7d6158b80610180541p7daa98d4pe8554619634ac132@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, I need to save some transient data calculated form Integrate Atributes
filter using pvbatch. How can I do it? I've found some hints in the forum
archives, but when I apply them to my case, just the first time step is
written to the file.
the filters are applied to a Data.case Ensight file, in the following
sequence:

Data.case -> cut0 -> Integrate0

In Integrate0, which is applied to pressure data from cut0, I turn on the
option Show XY-plot and then, after running through all time steps via "Play
the animation" button, Save CSV data. The question is: how can I automate
this data saving in a batch script, in order to get the whole transient data
to the file?

thanks in advance

Subject: [Paraview] Moving dataset by another dataset operation
Message-ID: <J7DQ6X$105102AEF140BB67A812A7F76855D375@libero.it>

Hi,
I'm an italian student, I'm writing my thesis in informatic at University of l'aquila. My job is extend paraview so that I can move my dataset relative to another dataset by a particular sensor that we have.
I know there exists "Actor Control" and "Transform Filter", However, in those commands, I can't move my dataset directly.
(I need to move it like Camera control in 3Dview).
What are the classes or files where I can modify "trasform filter" or "actor control" ?
thank you...

bye

Hi Karla,

It seems there's a lot of people waiting for the same thing (a PV binary
distribution for Win64)
 
I tried, unsuccessfully, to compile PV 2.2.1 and PV 2.4.3 with Visual Studio
2005 in x64. In fact, I'm still having problems to compile PV even for 32
bits with VS2005 -- imagine for 64 bits...
 
Hey folks, Does anyone know what is the mistery behind Visual Studio 2005
that the binaries produced always ask for a DLL (MSVCR80.dll) and never
works?! I tried static/dynamic linking but nothing worked :-)

PV compiles fine on VS2005, even with Incredibuild (a distributed build
tool) and also runs on Intel CPUs as well as on AMD Platforms. However, I
still couldn't manage to build a x64 binary. With applying some sort of
patches all sources will be compiled, but linking fails. So far no luck for
64Bit binary on Windows... If anybody had more success - I would like to
know.

Best,

Ben

A colleague of mine was able to get a 64-bit version of ParaView running on
Windows XP64.  He had to split it into 2 parts.  The GUI was compiled
32-bits and the server was compiled with 64-bits.  The compiler he used was
Visual Studio 2005.

Subject: [Paraview] How to run ParaView on a cluster without X server
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0610191126550.16334@hal>

Hello,

I attempted to run ParaView on a Linux cluster. The cluster has one 
special node, which user can log on and submit jobs. All the other 
nodes are not accessable from outside.

As the cluster doesn't have X on any node I was trying to run ParaView in 
the client/server mode. The problem is that processes running on internal 
nodes couldn't get connected with pvclient running on a desktop outside 
the cluster via port 11111 (other ports, no matter priviledged or not, are 
blocked too). Did anyone encounter this situation? And what's the 
solution?

I tried ssh -R to forward port 11111 of the login node of the cluster 
to that of my desktop, and start pvserver with -ch="login_node", but it 
didn't work.

I would very much appreciate it if you could give me 
solution/suggestion...

Well, it wants an X server on each node for the Rendering/Compositing
functions...

If you /really/ want to run it without X, then either compile paraview with
MangledMesa, or use pvdataserver instead of pvserver.

I already built ParaView with mesa and did off-screen rendering so "no X" 
is not an issue in my case. The problem lies on pvclient/pvserver 
connection. And I already made it work by running pvserver only on the 
login node. But I really want to run ParaView in parallel.

oh, sorry.. I misunderstood your problem..

You're saying that your backend nodes have no external visibility? (eg, they
can't see the client).  We have that same situation here.  There's a few
options that I know of, other folks here may know more:
1) Make sure that Process 0 of your pvserver is running on the Head-Node.
Only Process-0 needs to communicate with the client.
2) Talk to your admins & get NAT setup on the cluster.

In short, you need to be able to get traffic between Process 0 and your
client.. If you can't access the nodes, and they can't access you, then
you're hosed.

Weiguang:

Can you try our remote rendering solution: run pvclient on the head node
and use VirtualGL to deliver to the desktop.  Please refer to:
    http://www.virtualgl.org/
Let me know if you have any issue with it.

Thank you very much, Randall. I will talk with our cluster-admin over your 
suggestion.

Does --client-host imply --reverse-connection? Did you try
--reverse-connection on both the pvclient and pvserver?

Yes, I did use -rc for both pvclient and pvserver.

Wow, I wonder know what you do in VS2005 to compile PV successfully.

I'm still struggling with such annoying manifest files (it's getting harder
to understand how to make a simple "hello world" C++ program with VS2005...)

I should confess that I'm not familiar with C++ issues -- I really love to
make my simple Fortran programs and I haven't got courage to learn C++ yet
;o). In fact, C++ is TOO much for my needs. My point is that it was so
simple to compile PV with VS2003 that I can't understand why it should be
different with VS2005? It seems that MS has reinvented the wheel with its
DLL's fauna that only MS programmers (or master and guru's Visual Studio
programmers) know how it works.

My problem is that after compiling PV I don't get success in launching the
program because it claims for MSVCR80.dll. In a normal Windows program, we
only need to copy such DLL to the program's directory or just put it in a
library path in order to have the program working, but with MS2005 it
couldn't be so simple.

Therefore, could you tell us what should be done in MS2005 or cmake to have
a working binary?

Thanks for any help

Renato.

ps: I'm sending this message to VTK's list because I'm sure that there are
some guys out there with the same problem with VTK's compilations.

pps: Visual Studio 2005 + ParaView (or VTK) + Cmake 2.4.3 + x64 = another
serious compilation problem

PV compiles fine on VS2005, even with Incredibuild (a distributed build
tool) and also runs on Intel CPUs as well as on AMD Platforms. However, I
still couldn't manage to build a x64 binary. With applying some sort of
patches all sources will be compiled, but linking fails. So far no luck for
64Bit binary on Windows... If anybody had more success - I would like to
know.

Best,

Ben

Subject: [Paraview] [ParaView3] hdf5 does not compile on SuSE 10.1
Message-ID: <45388CE1.4050805@gmx.de>

Hi,

I just checked ParaView3 out using cvs and get an error, while trying to
compile on SuSE 10.1 (it works fine on Fedora 6).

errors:
H5Tpublic.h:186: Fehler: expected declaration specifiers or ?...? before
?hsize_t?
H5Tpublic.h:499: Fehler: expected ?;?, ?,? or ?)? before ?dim?
H5Tpublic.h:501: Fehler: expected declaration specifiers or ?...? before
?hsize_t?
H5Tpublic.h:558: Fehler: expected declaration specifiers or ?...? before
?hsize_t?


I the problem must be related to hsize_t and gcc 4.1.0 on SuSE.

Any ideas?

Greetings
Jens

Hello,
 
I am new to the ParaView community. I have my source code and so far have been using a converter for Ensight5 format. I understand ParaView only reads Ensight Gold format (case). Before I start chaging things around, I wanted to make sure this already does not exist. If someone knows of an existing utility/method to convert to Ensight Gold format, please let me know.

As far as I know, PV supports Ensight6 and Ensight Gold formats.
 
If you have your source code, I guess, you can easily (re)implement a
routine to write Ensight's newer formats (6 or Gold) since they are very
easy to understand and implement (take care with Fortran binary files if
you've been using Fortran language).
 
NOTE.: PV still has some deficiencies related to Ensight's readers. It seems
that PV features are only fully supported to VTK format's or to the formats
dictated by the team priorities. Thus, if you'd like to use some PV advanced
features (volume rendering animations, for example) I wouldn't suggest the
Ensight's formats.
 
Regards
 
Renato.

Subject: [Paraview] Readers compatibility list
Message-ID: <002f01c6f56f$9658ba10$6500a8c0@neutron>


Hey guys,

Is there a ParaView compatibility list according to the reader used?

For example:

VTK Format: all PV filters supported, parallel reading, lookmarks
Exodus: filter X, Y, Z, volume rendering, parallel reading, etc...
Plot3D: filter W, K, L (partially supported)
Ensight: ...
...
...

It would be helpful when deciding which format should be adopted to use with
ParaView.

maybe someone in PV team already have something like that.

Hi Renato,

I don't have a compatibility list.

Some of the issues you have been running into is due to the transition
to the new multi-block code in VTK. Although many of the filters
worked out of the box after the move to the new code, some require
changes to handle the new data structures. The readers that show
these problems are:
* Ensight
* Plot3D
* XML multiblock/AMR

We are working on improving the multi-block support. Meanwhile, I will
introduce a filter that can convert a multi-block dataset to a simple
dataset by extracting one block. Using that filter, you will be able
to extract one block and apply all available filters as before. This
is a temporary solution. As the multi-block support grows, more and
more filters will become available. There are more filters avaible for
multiblock datasets in 2.6. I will try to generate a list of those
that do not work before the release.

As for lookmarks, we are rewriting them completely in paraview 3. They
will work for all readers. If you have issues with the lookmark
implementation in paraview 2, post a bug report (or point me to one if
it exists) and I will see if it can be fixed before 2.6.

As for volume rendering, you will be able to volume render image and
unstructured data  as long as they are "simple" datasets. If you have
a multi-block dataset produced by one of the readers above, you will
have to apply a filter to convert it to a simple dataset.

As for parallel reading, the readers that I know support parallel reading are:
* Parallel XML readers
* EnSight SOS reader
* XDMF reader (structured and partitioned unstructured)
* Exodus reader
* Spyplot reader

There may be others. If a reader does not support parallel reading,
paraview will take care of redistributing data over MPI. This
behaviour is a little different depending on the data type. For
polydata and unstructured grids, the first node will read all the data
and redistribute using MPI. For structured datasets (image,
rectilinear and structured grids), all processes will read all the
data and then crop it.

I hope this helps. If you are aware of any bugs in any of these, let me know.

Subject: [Paraview] How to Bump Animation One Step
Message-ID: <B6AC8466957136BACAB92EB6@harpo.psc.edu>

Greetings,

What is the class/method to call to bump the animation one step forward? There is a button in the GUI to do this but I need to make it happen from within the code.

Here's the reason: we are creating a "live" display of information as it is being created. In our case we will use a pvd file to declare the names of the files for all time steps including those that don't yet exist.

The plan is to look for the next file (or set of files) and then bump the animation one step. It seems this should be done by a new routine added to the server background loop.

Which leads to another question: can someone say where the server background loop is executed?

It seems like a live display would be a natural for paraview given its sponsors. Has anyone at Sandia, Los Alamos, LLNL, etc. done this sort of thing?

Thanks in advance!

Hello Gregory, Kent,

I am actually working on this feature in ParaView. I cannot promise the time
frame for the feature to be complete, but I have best people working on it.

There will be couple of iterations we will go through, but I assume there
should be a prototype available soon.

You can start a wiki page now to describe the behavior you are interested
in, so we can get discussion running.

Thank you.

Andy

Hi Randall,
 
It's a good starting point, but as you said it only partially answer my
point. I guess, It would be easier for the PV team to list PV features
according to the reader employed and to the PV users to describe the bugs
found. In other words, from the PV users side, this compatibility list could
be built by listing the bugs found (I know that Kitware has a bug list
system but some things get a bit dispersed in such system). This kind of
information should be available on the ParaView Oficial's Wiki, as well as
in any other PV information site. We always have question regarding file
formats and their features on the PV maillist.
 
Regards
 
Renato.

Hey guys,

Is there a ParaView compatibility list according to the reader used?

For example:

VTK Format: all PV filters supported, parallel reading, lookmarks
Exodus: filter X, Y, Z, volume rendering, parallel reading, etc... 
Plot3D: filter W, K, L (partially supported)
Ensight: ...

...

It would be helpful when deciding which format should be adopted to use with
ParaView.

maybe someone in PV team already have something like that.

Hi Berk, thanks for you reply.

I've been following the great improvements that the PV team has been doing
with the software and, I guess, that all PV users are concious and recognize
that PV is a great software in the development phase and that it has bugs
(as any other software) and that new and old features have been, massively,
developed everyday. My idea with the "compatibility list" would be a place
to gather information about PV readers and their compatibility according to
the PV version. It could be started as a table in the PV wiki's page where
anyone could make a compatibility checkmark in this table. Something like:


PV version 2.x

             VTK   PLOT3D   EXODUS   ENSIGHT
Filter X:     X      X        X 
Filter Y:            X        X         X
Filter Z:     X      X

In the future, new PV users that are looking for the file format which best
suit their needs could use this table. Furthermore, according to the PV
evolution and the problems worked out, this table would be changed
accordingly.

I know that Ensight's readers have been reimplemented in the newer PV
versions and that some features are not available yet, for example: I'm able
to use volume rendering when I load my data in parallel using the Ensight
SOS format, but I can't produce animations with such datasets (which are
simple)since it's not supported yet (we could put it in a table to future
users -- besides the bug track). 

I only know such issues related to Ensight's format, firstly because I'm
still using Ensight's formats and secondly because I read the maillist
frequently and sometimes post my own problems here. Imagine, for example, a
new PV user willing to use the Ensight's format (or any other format), this
person would face the same problems than I (and others) without having the
chance to know about them in advance.

Anyway, we could try to start something like a "compatibility list" on some
wiki's page as Randall did.

Thanks a lot for your feedback

Renato.

Hi Ricardo,

I've put some very simple Fortran routines to write Ensight binary files in
the following link:
http://www.nacad.ufrj.br/~rnelias/paraview/EnsightRoutines.zip. There are
other routines available in the maillist. 

Regarding the problems you can face with the Ensight format and ParaView. I
would say that they are only annoying if you're intending to use some
features not fully supported yet. For a fast and easy starting point, the
Ensight's format will surely solve your problems.

Hope it helps

You could try passing your data through a "Smooth" filter (in the Filter

IN Paaview 2.5 I can read in .cube Files made with Gaussian 03 ok, but
i cannot get the scalars,
I get following error message:
#error or warning_ VTK Error in file vtkDataReader.cxx 1638: cannot

  I had already downloaded them. Found my problem:
  .both the geometry file and the results file must be in binary;
  .as I was compiling with the intel fortran compiler I had to had the
"-assume byterecl" flag so the record size is in bytes and not words.

  hope this helps anyone else that faces the same problem.

Hi all.

I believe that's an easy one for the experts.

Does any one knows what method executed on my vtk3DWidget executes the
vtkPV3DWidget::ExecuteEvent(vtkObject *, unsigned long, void *) ???

I can't find anything on the f?rums about that.

Thank's for your time and attention!

Message-ID: <DEAE984CCA87ABDE73A4F4CD@harpo.psc.edu>

I use and refer others to the excellent summary at

   http://public.kitware.com/VTK/pdf/file-formats.pdf

but it needs an update.

One omission that took us a couple of days to understand concerns the "AppendedData" tag used with the XML formats. There is an undocumented encoding, "raw", that is quite useful except for a nasty surprise: each section of raw data must start with a
4-byte integer giving the number of bytes in that section. See

   vtkXMLDataParser::ReadUncompressedData

Also, though the "pvd" format is not officially VTK, it is closely associated with VTK so it would make sense to include it in this document (the book's definition doesn't include all of the newest options).

Message-ID: <7d6158b80610250929w18bbb5ddo8d5d33766d9ad968@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, I've written a pvbatch script to calculate the average pressure on a
series of planes (cut filters) spamming a time interval (input is written in
Ensight file format, if it matters).

The basic sequence is

Cut -> IntegrateAttributes -> TemporalPick -> XYPlot

And this sequence loops over the time, reading each of the ensight input
files.

I have to use PrintAsCSV to get the data from TemporalPick filter to a file,
but I want to avoid this for two reasons:

1. it makes the process too slow
2. I have 200 cut filters and 100 time steps, meaning that there would be
20000 cut filters in the end of the work. After approximately 1000 cuts are
made, pvbatch stops with the message

Process Cutter [...........]
Process IntegrateAttributes [...........]
Process TemporalPickFilter [...........]
Process MPIMoveData [...........]
Xlib: connection to ":0.0" refused by server

segmentation fault.

first question: What does this error mean? It looks like an error in X, not
in paraview, right?
second question: Regardless of the above error, how can I get the average
pressure from TemporalPick without using XYPlot, render or any graphical
object?


Thanks in advance

Message-ID: <B1AD10B32508ADEC083AAF9C@harpo.psc.edu>

Submitted as bug 3988. Content below.

Kent
Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center

======

ParaView 2.4.4 on Linux (FC5, i386) crashes when it reads a session-state file (pvs) when the file was made while doing volume visualization.

The crash occurs in vtkPVVolumeAppearanceEditor.cxx as it prepares the vol vis parameters for one of the inputs that is only geometry, i.e., it has no scalar data.

Two changes seemed to fix the problem. In ::SetPVSourceAndArrayInfo replace
+++
  vtkPVDataInformation* dataInfo = source->GetDataInformation();
  if ( !this->PVSource || !this->ArrayInfo || !pvApp || !dataInfo ||
---
with
+++
  if ( !this->PVSource ) return;
  vtkPVDataInformation* dataInfo = source->GetDataInformation();
  if ( !this->ArrayInfo || !pvApp || !dataInfo ||
---
and in ::SetScalarOpacityUnitDistance change
+++
if ( !this->PVSource && this->ArrayInfo
---
to
+++
if ( !this->PVSource || !this->ArrayInfo )
---
Also, several annoying messages saying that "PVSource not set!" were eliminated. Maybe there is a better way to fix the problem.

Hi the list,

Outline filter can be used as style representation in the file loader or
as a filter.

If you use Outline as a filter, one can set its color. Ok.

But I can't getting it work using in the file loader : "Set Solid
Color..." item stay greyed.

I don't understand why.

Any suggestion ?

Hello all,

A result of my computation software is a list of points (X,Y,Z).
How can I see this result with paraview ?

- Must I write this result in another file ? if yes, which file type is 
directly load in paraview as a list of points ?
- Can I write in in my vtu file ? if yes How ?

Thanks for your help.

A vtu file using cell type "point" seems like a good idea.

Maybe the extra library is missing - just set:
MPI_EXTRA_LIBRARY = ...mpi/mpich/lib/libmpich.a

Hope that helps.

Since you're building on Windows, your MPI_LIBRARY name should be 
something like mpich.lib; the .a file extension indicates a static 
library on a unix machine. The file libmpich.a probably does not exist 
on your machine, but mpich.lib probably does (judging from the install 
of MPICH on my Windows machine.) Find the directory where MPICH was 
installed. (I think C:/Program Files/MPICH is the default.) Look in the 
SDK/Lib directory for the library file.

Hi, Christian,

We have the same configuration as yours, so I am very
interested in trying the cave rendering mode out. From
your document, step 2, it says Paraview 2.5 (from cvs)
with MPI enabled and Paraview 2.5 not MPI enabled, do
you  mean the server will run with mpi enable and the
client with mpi not enabled? which means pvserver will
be compiled with MPI enabled and pvclient will be
compiled without MPI enabled? 


Do we really need paraview2.5, how about lower  stable
version, like paraview2.4? 

Thank you in advance for your help and I really
appreciate your efforts in investigating paraview cave
render mode.

Hi Yi !

In fact i use 2.5 because i can read in .cube gaussian files for 2.4
there is an error but the cave module ??? (should run also)
The problem is if you have a cave with 3 walls you need 3 processors
for 4 4 processors ...
i can run the pvserver with the cave display and mpi and on the client
in our case (maybe also in yours) the same.

so run :
on prism:
>mpirun -np 3 .\pvserver cave.pvx
also on prism another screen or session
> ./pvclient --stereo 

you can see the client is connected to the server and the Client gui is
opend on the display of pvclient is set.

the actual cave display is set in the cave.pvx 

Be carefull in defining cave.pvx during my struggle with paraview on
the cave i found out the this is more or less on of the keys in getting
a good cave visualisation.

You can send me your cave.pvx (what ever you named it) and your
configuration and i can give my hints.

i be happy to help you

Hmm, PV3 does not.

Subject: [Paraview] Writing/Deploying Paraview Plugins
Message-ID: <C16CC176.947B%mike.jackson@imts.us>

I have been asked to write some Paraview readers and filters for our data
and I have some questions that the Paraview book is not answering for me (or
at least that I could find).
 Having taken a Paraview class in the past I have a basic idea of what needs
to be done but since the deployment is on Windows XP and I am mainly a Mac
OS X developer I have some questions.

1. What is the "Windows Binary" that is downloadable from vtk.org compiled
with? MSVC? MinGW?

2. As I understand things the user can load my plugins at runtime. But do
they have to manually load the plugin every time they launch Paraview? Is
there a config file on windows that I can setup to automatically load the
plugins at every launch or do I have to Recompile Paraview with my code
included to get that to work?

3. Assuming I might have to recompile Paraview on Windows what is the basic
procedure? I have MS VC 2005 (Full Edition) available? I also have a MinGW
evn setup and ready to go.

4. Along the lines of 3, do I have Cmake create nmake files, VS project
files or something else to compile Paraview?


I know some of these are some basic questions but I would like to hear from
other paraview programmers so I can get up to speed as quick as I can.

Thanks

I am not sure if that'll solve your problem but try to add e+00 to point 
coordinates.

Hello all,

In fact PV 2.4 on Windows XP Sp2 stop when I open my vtu file by the 
menu [File]/[Open Recent File]/...
And this same file works when I load it by [File]/[Open Data].

Subject: [Paraview] Syntax Error when generating ClientServer code
Message-ID: <C16CDE5D.94D2%mike.jackson@imts.us>

In my header file I have:

#ifndef __PrdsThreshold_h

#define __PrdsThreshold_h


#include "vtkUnstructuredGridAlgorithm.h"


class PrdsThreshold  : public
vtkUnstructuredGridAlgorithm
{

};

And when make tries to generate the ClientServer code I get the following
error:

*** SYNTAX ERROR found in parsing the header file
/Users/mjackson/Projects/Task_4/DVParaview/PrdsThreshold.h before line 9
***
syntax error

Which isn't telling me much. I am working off of an example and comparing
the code against the example doesn't enlighten me to the problem. Could some
one take pitty on my and show me the stupid mistake that I am making?

Thanks

So I changed the name of my class from PrdsThreshold to vtkPrdsThreshold and
now the code compiles..
 That seems like an odd restriction on class naming? Or am I still missing
something?

Sorry to interrupt your usual Paraview discussions, but I wanted to fill all
you guys in on a new website myself and some friends are working on called
VizWorld.com.  We're hoping to develop this into a large community site
discussing developments in both Scientific Visualization and Computer
Graphics.

We've got a blog with comments enabled, Forums, and a Wiki (at
http://wiki.vizworld.com) and we'ld love it if you guys would get involved
and help to develop the site.  Being a big Paraview fan myself, I've got
alot of information about using Paraview and Client-Server examples.  But it
doesn't stop there, we've got information on Maya, 3ds Max, Ensight, and
more.  In the near future we hope to start including alot of system
integration tips and examples to show you how to get all these different
tools to work together to create some truly stunning stuff.  If you've got
questions about any particular topic, then post them in the Forums and maybe
someone can help you out.  If we all "share the knowledge" then we'll all
benefit, I'm sure.

Right now we've got a guy at IEEE Viz06 in Baltimore, MD, posting his
experiences and what's new at the conference this year.  Anyone else who's
there and would like to join in, feel free! Accounts are free, and I promise
I won't spam you.  If you have a good idea for an article, feel free to
write it up and submit it or mail it to an admin.  We'ld love some good
stuff from you University & DOE types, and we'ld love a good "What's new in
Paraview 3" article :)

So that's that, just wanted to fill all you folks in... Hope you find the
site useful, and long live Paraview & VTK!

Thierry,

Remember these readers were written by C-programmers. They want offsets 
for "connectivity" not node numbers.

I changed your data below under connectivity from 1,2,3, ... ,10 to 
0,1,2, ... ,9. you will get points on your screen.

Don't forget to dail-up the point size og the display face-sheet.  Now 
all you have to do is data to your points (or cells
as you like.
