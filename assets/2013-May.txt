Subject: [Paraview] Load Plugin Error
Message-ID: <067E8450-9532-4079-BA6B-E447E9564251@mac.com>

Hi all,


I'm trying to build and load 3rd parties' plugins on Mac OS 10.7.5.
The sources of plugins are downloaded here:
<http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/User_Created_Plugins>

Today I built both ParaView 3.98.1 and plugins successfully,
but when I load plugins, ParaView hangs for seconds and terminated.
This time I tried libTensorGlyphFilter.dylib, but all other plugins
were same.


The attached file is the error log.
How could I solve the problem?

Are you trying to load them in the ParaView binary you built or the
one downloaded from paraview.org?

Thanks, Andy. Yes, that is indeed what we're trying to do. My collaborators are currently plotting velocity profile after simulation is done and then determining at which time step the transient simulation converged by observing that velocity profile. Via in-situ run, they can set up a representative slice and use the integrated velocity for that slice to approximate the velocity profile so that they can determine at which time step the simulation converges while simulation is ongoing. After giving this some more thought, I agree writing numbers out is not a good way to achieve this. Your suggestion to tie this integrated velocity output with simulation code sounds like a great way to achieve this. I will look deeper into PV's Python API and try to figure this out. The goal is to pass this integrated velocity value for each time step from Catalyst back to the simulation code so that the simulation code can determine when it has reached a steady state.

Best regards,

Hong

Hi Hong,
I just want to verify what you're really trying to do. It looks like you want to use Catalyst to figure out if your transient simulation has reached a steady state by determining if an integrate value stays constant over several time steps I guess this could be done in Catalyst but convergence criteria is probably better handled in the simulation code itself. As far as getting information from Catalyst back into the simulation code, that's doable but may take a bit of work for those not familiar with ParaView's Python API. You may be able to figure it out with the previous information I sent you. Once that's computed in the Python script, you can pass that information back to your adaptor code with vtkCPDataDescription's UserData object.

Thanks, Andy. Please correct me if I am wrong since I may not get what you really mean here. I agree the first option sounds like a good one, and I am thinking I can modify the co-processing script to add "CreateWriter()" to write the output from the Integrate Variables filter. Since it is not a parallel writer, I am thinking this "CreateWriter()" might work by only writing to disk from the first processor. Otherwise, there might be a way to pass this output value to the simulation code Phasta for it to output the value only from the first processor? Since users need to observe the output from simulation when running it in-situ (without live feed at this point), the only way I can think of is through the disk output for the users to observe, or is there another way?

Thanks again,

Hong

I can think of two options for this, the first is modifying the co-processing script to get the data you want directly from the output without writing it to disk. Look at http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Python_Scripting for some information on that. Otherwise, you can try using the Python programmable filter to extract the data as well and write it to disk.

If it was me I'd go with the first option.

Thanks, Andy. In our case, users only want to observe one integrated velocity value (one output value from Integrate Variable Filter) for the slice at each time step so that they can determine from which time point on this velocity value stops changing which indicates to them the simulation has converged. So this large amount of output files from the ParallelUnstructuredGridWriter is hard to serve this purpose. I am wondering whether there is a way for me to export the SpreadSheetRepresentation view (to view Integrate Variable Filter output) as a screen capture when I export pipeline in python for coprocessing? It looks like the "Export State" GUI for coprocessing only allows to export rendered views, not other types of views. If not, I am thinking perhaps I can write a customized writer plugin to only export the needed output value for our purpose and to make this writer only exports one file for each time step regardless of the number of processors it runs on.

Thanks for any more information you can provide!

Hi,
The parallel XML data set writers all write independently of each other (no MPI communication is needed in the writers). Because of this they can't tell process 0 when writing it's meta-data file that it doesn't need to write out meta data for them.

I am running a simulation in-situ linked with ParaView CoProcessing library with a pipeline that includes "slice->Integrate Variables Filter->ParallelUnstructuredGridWriter" so that integrated velocity value for a slice at each time point can be written out while running the simulation in-situ. The output from this ParallelUnstructureGridWriter for each time step includes one pvtu file plus one vtu file from each running node, so that is a lot of output files for each time point especially when running on a large number of nodes in parallel. However, it looks like only the output vtu file from processing node 0 includes valid velocity range value while other output vtu files from other nodes include only blank/empty values. So I am wondering whether there is a good way to set up only outputting vtu file from processing node 0 to prevent output of those large number of files that don't include valid/useful values. Any suggestions are very much appreciated.

Thanks,

Hong

Is there a way to tell the SuperBuild process to not look for software updates using GIT?     I doing a build on a system that doesn't have public network access and I'm actually dying on a complaint about my instance of git being too old.  However, I have already copied in the sources, so I don't want it looking for updates anyway.

That's not how threshold works. Threshold includes cells as a whole or it
does not. What you want is Clip using a scalar value (or 2 clips if you
need upper and lower end clipping).

Can you point the cmake directives to look in a Downloads directory and
determine which packages to be built based on the tarballs in that download
directory?

Maybe when we tag a release in Superbuild we modify the verions.cmake to
point to tarballs for just that tag. That allows people to be able to
replicate the release without having to do anything.

This shows that it clips off a part of the surface mesh data correctly. The
integral values also now change smoothly with the clipping range

Rick,

In the cmake advanced view, you can set the "download_location" cmake
variable to point to your  downloads dir. It doesn't however detect
what packages to build automatically. You'll have to enable the
ENABLE_* flags manually looking at the tar balls you have. Since it
does dependencies, all you really need to think of is the big
components, like "paraview", "qt", "matplotlib", the things they
depend on, will automatically be turned on.

Subject: [Paraview] Laramie Immersive Visualization Bootcamp
Message-ID: <51816B22.2070006@indiana.edu>

Greetings ParaView community,

Indiana University, in conjunction with the University of Wyoming, Idaho
National Lab and Kitware Inc. will be holding the second of two bootcamps
on immersive visualization.

The first one, held the week after IEEE VR 2013 went well, though a 
snowstorm
blasting through central Indiana that week did wreak a little havoc.
Other than that though, we had a great time:
     - http://wiki.iq-station.com/index.php?title=Bootcamp_IUPUI

We'll be holding the second bootcamp at the School for Energy Resources
(SER) at the University of Wyoming in Laramie from June 12-14.  The
SER has a brand-new CAVE and a software suite aimed at immersive
visualization.  Registration for the second bootcamp is now open:
     - http://iq-station.org/bootcamp.html

Of course, we'll be talking about the new VR plugin for ParaView among
other topics.  The full announcement is below.

     Thank you,
     Bill

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Indiana University is leading a pair of bootcamps on Immersive
Visualization software in conjunction with the Idaho National Lab,
the University of Wyoming, and Kitware Inc.  We have organized two of
these bootcamps (both basically the same).  The first event, held
in Indianapolis in March was well received, and we have now opened
registration for the Western bootcamp to be held in Laramie Wyoming
in the new Energy Innovation Center (EIC), using the brand new immersive
visualization facilities of the School of Energy Resources (SER).

Each bootcamp is a full two-day event (but spread over three days).
The cost is $200/person -- basically for food and minor expenses.

The overall theme is a how-to session for open-source visualization
software in VR (leaning toward CAVE-style) environments.  Some of the
software is Unix-variant oriented, and a handful will work on Windows.
Presentations are geared toward teams that make immersive facilities
available for scientific analysis, and for scientists seeking tools
that can help them take advantage of existing facilities.


Planned topics include:
         * General Purpose Vis (Immersive ParaView)
         * Point-cloud data (LidarViewer)
         * Volume Rendering (Toirt Samhlaigh)
         * Molecular viewer (VMD)
         * Matlab VR interface
         * Archeology Vis with CalVR
         * System configuration
         * Low-cost Immersive Systems
         * Human Computer Interface considerations
         * Workflow examples at INL
         * Interaction capabilities

Registration is now open for the second, "Western", bootcamp to be held
at the University of Wyoming June 12-14.  The material presented will
generally follow the same syllabus as the Indianapolis bootcamp.

A web page with further information and how to register is at:
     - http://iq-station.org/bootcamp.html

A wiki entry on the bootcamp held in Indanapolis is available at:
     - http://wiki.iq-station.com/index.php?title=Bootcamp_IUPUI

Please let me know if you have any questions.  Also feel free to pass along
to anyone who might be interested.

Hi Utkarsh,


Yes, I built both ParaView 3.98.1 and plugins from sources on same terminal.

There are additional informations.
The attached file is CMake log of TensorGlyph.
When I build plugins, I set ParaView_DIR at build directory of PV 3.98.1.
Pre-installed plugins are working fine.

Try setting DYLD_PRINT_LIBRARIES environment variable and ensure that
what's getting loaded is correct.

Hi Utkarsh,


Thanks for your advice.

I tried DYLD_PRINT_LIBRARIES.
The attachment file is the result.
But I couldn't find the outputs are correct or not.

Subject: [Paraview] Cube axes label format
Message-ID: <CAOqTh=nVgWg6yXOCYNotiZ3ZTux0ZS71zd9H4mYD59WbKbrheg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am using Paraview to visualize data in UTM coordinates. I have a problem
with the labels on the Northing axes, since the label format doesn't
include enough digits for the range my data is in ( as seen on in the
figure attached to the email).

How can I access the string format to be able to change it?

I have made some attempts to do this via a the python shell by doing by
accessing the represtation, rep = GetRepresention() and explore the options
there. But I haven't been able to find where I could change the format. I
have found with google and from playing with the vtk 5.10.1 that
vtkCubeAxesActor has get/set*LabelFormat methods that I am not able to find
in Paraview.

I am using Paraview 3.98.1 (pre-compiled version) on a 64-bit Fedora 17
system.

Thanks for the help.
Cheers,
Gudni

Torben,

 

Checkout TurboVNC/VirtualGL - pretty sure it can be built with mesa if no
GPU is available.

Hi All

 

I'm trying to make paraview run over vnc (and xrdp)

 

I'm using default build from debian wheezy with libgl1-mesa-swx11

 

I have GLX (glxgears) and VTK (simple Python VTK example) working but
paraview shows just the splash screen and the error;

 

X Error: BadDrawable (invalid Pixmap or Window parameter) 9

  Major opcode: 62 (X_CopyArea)

  Resource id:  0x0

 

and nothing else happens.

 

If I run it as

$ ssh -X localhost paraview

still inside the VNC session it seems to work fine

 

What do I need to make it work directly?

 

Thanks

Regards

Torben

Hello,

Thanks for the reply Sebastien.

Is there any way where I can deal with this? I want to make
a publishable figure from my work in Paraview and this issue with labels is
the last problem that I need to deal with. Is it possible to mix the
Paraview script (.py state file of the model) and vtk 5.10.1 method to fix
the labels and generate the figure I want?

Is there anybody that has been able to deal with this problem that can
share some idea's?

Thanks very much in advance.

Cheers,
Gudni

One solution is to change the scale. You can subtract the constant part 
to your coordinates.

Not sure why it isn't in the 3.98 release. I vaguely recall we had some
problems packaging it with mountain lion. Perhaps Sebastien remembers the
details.

It certainly can work on Mac (I did most of my development for it on Mac).
In ParaView we don't use any of the X11 display portions of Manta since we
just use it as an offscreen rendering library. Try ParaView 3.14 if you
want to take it for a spin.

In Mountian Lion if you want to run standalone Manta you can always install
XQuartz to get X11 back. Before Mountain Lion you didn't have to even do
that.

Do you know exactly the set of methods that needs to be called on the VTK
objects ? I can certainly try to expose them on the Python layer which
could let you have a wider set of possibilities. (For that just give me a
list of method calls that you would like to be able to do in C++)

I can somehow guide you on how to get a reference to the VTK objects from
the Python layer but all the methods that you need to access have to be
public.

Another approach could be to 'patch' the vtkCubeAxesRepresentation so the
default behavior will be what you expect...

There is many way to tackle the current limitation.

Can you also try setting DYLD_PRINT_LIBRARIES_POST_LAUNCH. The log you
sent doesn't have all the libs. What I want is the output one gets on
a linux system with LD_DEBUG=libs. Not exactly sure how to do that on
OsX. Maybe someone else here knows.

Hello,

i am playing around with vtkParseMain, which is used by 
WrappingClientServer to
generate New, Init and Command functions for the ClientServer Interpreter.
I am using the ParaView source from tar.gz archive of version 3.98.1

i parse the file vtkXMLReader.h using this program:

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
   FileInfo *fileInfo;
   int i;

   /* get command-line args and parse the header file */
   fileInfo = vtkParse_Main(argc, argv);
   for (i = 0; i < fileInfo->MainClass->NumberOfFunctions; ++i)
   {
     if (strcmp("SetFileName", fileInfo->MainClass->Functions[i]->Name))
     {
         continue;
     }
     printf("%s \n", fileInfo->MainClass->Functions[i]->Signature);
   }
   return 0;
}

during reading output of member function signatures
i recognized that the constness is wrong. it shows:

void SetFileName(char *);

instead of

void SetFileName(const char *);

like it is shown in doxygen documentation.

Best regards,
Henry

Hi Utkarsh,


DYLD_PRINT_LIBRARIES_POST_LAUNCH shows just 2 libraries:
> dyld: loaded: /System/Library/CoreServices/Encodings/libJapaneseConverter.dylib
> dyld: loaded: /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/CoreServicesInternal.framework/Versions/A/CoreServicesInternal
and they were shown by DYLD_PRINT_LIBRARIES.

There are few informations about Mac OS X.
So I'll compare with ParaView on my Linux.

Subject: [Paraview] Script driven paraview
Message-ID: <CAM9occgM-Q-ATtcbHmFjv2ouAk_gbyRWEqVD6WOWujU7Yra1vw@mail.gmail.com>

I would like to display a set of meshes that result from a (bash) script
driven set of simulations
and meshing steps.

I have written a script that does what I want (at least basically), if I
manually go into the paraview
gui and start the (Tools -->) Python Shell, then hit run script and select
the desired script.

In an attempt to automate the visialization, I wrote a bash script with the
two relevant lines being:

paraview &>/dev/null &
pvpython show_vtu.py

This generates non-persistent, non-interactive images that I expect -
though it would be good
to know if there is a way to make such images persistent and interactive.
(in addition to
starting paraview)

Question:  Is there a way to use such a script (bash, python called from
bash . . . ) to
start paraview, and use a script to visualize data in the gui?

Thanks,
Tim

Subject: [Paraview] dynamic variable names in pvython
Message-ID: <CAM9occgJPEM5e+8GOT+TOSQGdP-+M9r35ge0CBox5jCr-6Hvvg@mail.gmail.com>

I use paraview to visualize the results of simulations.

I use Trace in the paraview gui, in order to use the generated scripts to
help guide
the development of the pypython script I use to visualize my simulation
results.

I would like to use dynamic variable names, and note that the scripts
generated
by Trace seem to use dynamic variable names.

Aside: The driver for this is that the number of meshes I want to display
differs
with each simulation.

I have looked over python posts on dynamic variable names . . .

Question: How are the (seemingly) dynamic variable names created
in/by/during
Trace?

Regards,
Tim

Hi Tim,

Variable names in trace are generated by this function defined in
smtrace.py:


def pyvariable_from_proxy_name(proxy_name):
  return servermanager._make_name_valid(proxy_name.replace(".", "_"))


That function will generate a suitable variable name from a proxy name.  A
proxy is registered with a name in a proxy group.  smtrace.py also defines
some functions to lookup the proxy name given a proxy and a proxy group.
For example:


>>> from paraview import smtrace
>>> s = Sphere()
>>> smtrace.get_source_proxy_registration_name(s)
'Sphere1'

>>> smtrace.pyvariable_from_proxy_name('Sphere1')
'Sphere1'

>>> help(smtrace.get_source_proxy_registration_name)
Help on function get_source_proxy_registration_name in module
paraview.smtrace:

get_source_proxy_registration_name(proxy)
Assuming the given proxy is registered in the group 'sources',
lookup the proxy's registration name with the servermanager


>>> help(smtrace.get_view_proxy_registration_name)
Help on function get_view_proxy_registration_name in module
paraview.smtrace:

get_view_proxy_registration_name(proxy)
Assuming the given proxy is registered in the group 'views',
lookup the proxy's registration name with the servermanager

Pat:

Thanks. Makes sense, though complicated (for me).

Being new to python, pvpython and vtk, I used the append attribute of lists.

Do you see a problem with that idea, as shown below? It works, but that is
not always the end of the story.
(num is the read number of vtu files to be processed):

files[]
reader[]
rep[]
. . .
i=0
while i<num
. . .
   files.append('results/layer_'+str(i+1)+'.vtu')
   reader.append(XMLUnstructuredGridReader(FileName=files[i]))
   rep.append(Show())
   Render()
   i=i+1


Thanks,
Ti

Message-ID: <CA+Zda3g0X56hVoWRUM67ijsT+2g_0ru9VfcCF4wSeW9=WLgQTA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I coded my own reader that produces image data, which works fine. Next I
wanted to load the data in a distributed system, where paraview spreads the
data over the nodes. I created a pvd file containing a collection:
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<VTKFile type="Collection" version="0.1" byte_order="LittleEndian">
  <Collection>
    <DataSet file="offset_0_0.vti"/>
    <DataSet file="offset_0_1.vti"/>
  </Collection>
</VTKFile>
Loading this file works just fine (with the vti-files). However, if I
change to my own file format, my reader is not recognised anymore. From the
code it seems that there is only a limited and fixed number of data formats
supported.

What would be the best way to load and process the data in parallel?

Hi

Felipe: Thanks for the suggestion. I had thought of this but it means I
would have to go through all my data and make these changes. This is a last
resort...

Sebastien: I have little experience with VTK it self, but I found that
vtkCubeAxesActor has the set*LabelFormat (where * is x,y or z) which are
exposed in the Python bindings. I have been playing with an example of a
VTK python script, where I have been able setup a problem with similar
dimension and changed the label Y to include a the additional number at the
end (code in attachment). I used SetYLabelFormat method of the
vtkCubeAxesActor to do this. However, I would ultimately like to be able to
have the exponent used to condense the label of all the axes the same, both
10? instead of x as 10? but y as 10?. Is it possible to control that
functionality in VTK?

As far as I can see some connection to the vtkCubeAxesActor.Set*LabelFormat
from Paraview is what I would need. What is the best way to do this?

Thanks for the help,
Gudni

Message-ID: <CAF5pkMtVpGHyT2OoOrMtpQogzAFhGeJ9NWJV2dX_h84L+6MhRA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I have been having intermittent problems with paraview since updating to
v3.98.1. After running the program for awhile, the program will hang for
10-30 seconds when changing the contour plot variable. This happens fairly
regularly with both large and small files. I don't believe that it is due
to low memory, each timestep in my dataset is approx 50 MB and I have
plenty of available ram.

Even opening a single timestep has the same problem. The problem usually
starts after 10-20 minutes working with the program and continues until the
program is restarted.

I have tried updating to the newest version(s): 3.98.1-Darwin,
3.98.0-10.6-10.7 as well as the nightly build. I have also cleared the
program preferences.

My machine is a dual Xeon 2.66 GHz with 32 GB ram and running OSX 10.7.5.

Has anybody else experienced these issues? If so, are there any workarounds?

Thanks,
James Thunes

Do you have Xcode installed?  If so, run Instruments.app to sample Paraview when it's hanging.  Or you could try sysdiagnose (see 'man sysdiagnose').

I use ParaView on my Mac and have never seen this. It would be great if you
could run ParaView under Instruments or even attach a debugger when it
hangs to get a stack trace.

Subject: [Paraview] segfault opening the color scale editor /
	vtkPVProminentValuesInformation?
In-Reply-To: <51844458.50500@lbl.gov>
References: <51844458.50500@lbl.gov>
Message-ID: <5187E4AF.9010608@lbl.gov>

Steps to reproduce:

Start pvserver running parallel 2 ranks
Open the attached dataset, load b array
Slice the dataset such that the slice contains no data from at least one 
rank.
Color slice by b array magnitude (default)
Open the color scale editor -> crash

I added the test dataset to the bug report:

Hi Burlen,

I'm working on it. It shouldn't take too long to fix. Thanks for the report.

Thanks Gudni,

I've just pushed something to next.

commit 89362b00ececb01765ce4683c4b6d40db4164370
Author: Sebastien Jourdain <sebastien.jourdain at kitware.com>
Date:   Mon May 6 15:55:27 2013 -0400

    Expose CubeAxes Label format to the proxy layer.

    Change-Id: I8af3ddf8ca33c8d27332cc5ae052e1e636388725


You should be able to get it inside the nightly binary by the end the week.

Then you will need to do inside the python shell:

>>> rep = Show(GetActiveSource())
>>> rep.CubeAxesXLabelFormat = "%-#1.4g"

The only thing that you might need to do, is to invalidate the bounds of
the cube axes (by changing your data in some way) to make sure the new
label get generated with the newly set format.

Message-ID: <6A422BABAB959549A1E860E170B2C49913F40B23@GADC-EMB002.na.pg.com>

I am trying to figure out how to use the Point Sprite representation in Paraview to create some visuals of output from a Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulation and found your contact information from a Paraview message board.  My data files are legacy format .vtk files.  I am having difficulty generating visuals for systems that include multiple particle sizes and was wondering if you could describe which switches need to be set or point me to a suitable tutorial?  I am using Paraview 3.98.0 64-bit on Windows 7.
Thank you very much,
Chris

Hi Chris,

To visualize Discrete Elements as Point Sprites with variable radius, 
here are the strategy I use:

1/ Check how the radii are stored:
     1.1/ If it is in a cell field, use 'cell data to point data' to 
copy it to the points
     1.2/ Then, if it contained with other data on a vector, use the 
Calculator to extract it as a scalar

2/ Select the Point Sprite representation : in the display tab, you can 
choose your scalar field to scale your sprites.

Don't hesitate to ask if it is not detailed enough.

Regards, Vincent

Hi Chris,

If you have a look at the point sprite plugin object inspector go to the
Display tab. Chose your field storing particle size parameter in the
Scale by field. After doing so a button "Edit Radius Transfer Function"
should appear just below the "Scale by" option. Click this button. In
the opening dialogue chose "Proportional" and click "close".
Now your spherical representations should be appropriately scaled by
your size parameter.

Regards


Flo

Subject: [Paraview] Wrong decoding of base64 binary file
Message-ID: <CACDq=foL_NouDXmgneRd5i6K1ESPxt1nPWhuzWzkF7Ms8C3cow@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I have some problems with base64 encoding.

I have reproduced my problems by means of a minimal StructuredGrid example.
Please, find attached the bae64 file (XML_BASE64.vts) and the corresponding
ascii one (XML_ASCII.vts).

The grid is very simple: 1 hexa with 8 points and one scalar value at each
point. Both vertices and point values are Float32.

As you can see the base64 binary file is not correctly loaded by Paraview.
I am not completely sure that the two base64 codes (for x,y,z coordinates
and for point values) are correct, because I have use my own encoder, but
they are identical to ones generated by python by means of "struc" and
"base64" module.

It seems in particular that the data of the last vertex (the 7th) are wrong.

Thank you for all suggestions,
my best regards

Stefano Zaghi

This isn't an "answer", but maybe a tool that you can use.  I would start ParaView, load your data, Tools/ Start Trace, change the variable, Tools/ Stop Trace.  This should tell you what you need to know.

Hi Andy,

I think it must be something with MPI4PY on my Mac. I got it to compile and run on the Utility server here at ERDC.

Now, is the example here https://github.com/acbauer/CatalystExampleCode/tree/master/CxxMultiPieceExample the easiest way to incorporate extents into the Fortran code? I am basically trying to run the Fortran example on more than one processor and I was going to adapt the Fortran FXCxxAdaptor following the CxxMultiPieceExample.

Unless there is a better way. My first attempt didn't create the expanding ball that the serial Fortran example does. It did produce an image, but not the one that I wanted.

Thanks
Lucas

Hi Lucas,

Every process should call coprocessorinitializewithpython(). I'm not sure how to solve this but first off maybe trying the Fortran 90 example at https://github.com/acbauer/CatalystExampleCode may help simplify the problem. What machine are you trying this on and what version of ParaView are you using?

Hello!

I have a Fortran serial test case working that uses the Catalyst coprocessor to generate images.

I tried moving to a parallel test case, but the program crashes with the error:

ORTE_ERROR_LOG: Attempt to redefine an existing data type in file runtime/orte_globals.c at line 218

at the call to initialize the coprocessor:

call coprocessorinitializewithpython("coproc.py",9)

Does this call change in parallel, or should only one processor be calling it?

If I comment out the line of code that calls the coprocessor initialization, then the code runs fine, I just get the error that the co-processor needs to initialize every time there is a VTK coprocessor call.

Thanks for any help,
Lucas

This isn?t an ?answer?, but maybe a tool that you can use.  I would start ParaView, load your data, Tools/ Start Trace, change the variable, Tools/ Stop Trace. 
 This should tell you what you need to know.

I'm using pvbatch to execute Paraview, but I have a question:

How can I change the Active Variable using pvbatch? (I mean, something other than "Solid Color")

Thanks in advance

When using 3.98.0, you will have to use the command line option
"--use-old-panels" to view the display properties for point sprite
plugin correctly. This has been fixed for the upcoming 4.0 release.

Look at the attached file. I generated that by saving XML_ASCII.vts
out as encoded binary file from ParaView. As you can see, your BASE64
file  and this doesn't match. Hopefully you can figure out the issues
from that.

Yes, that's as expected, at least in 3.14. Support for that was added
later, if I remember correctly.

Message-ID: <201305081426.r48EQs58038220@mech-cluster241.men.bris.ac.uk>

I'm using paraview 3.10.1 in interactive mode.
With nearly every graphical operation, I see on
console this set of messages repeated endlessly:

QPainter::begin: Paint device returned engine == 0, type: 2
QPainter::setRenderHint: Painter must be active to set rendering hints
QPainter::setBrush: Painter not active
QPainter::end: Painter not active, aborted

What is this about?

I'm able to use paraview fine, so is this
some sort of warning? Can I fix it?

Thanks

Can you try to see if you get the same with a newer version of
ParaView? You can even try the nightly builds
(http://paraview.org/paraview/resources/software.php)

You can use the "--script" command line argument to "paraview"
executable to run a Python script after startup e,g,
> paraview --script=show_vtu.py

Message-ID: <345817C8A61EA841AAE0120EC1514D954744FD1C@ucolhp9a.easf.csd.disa.mil>

I'm trying to build ParaView 3.98.1 on a RHEL6 cluster and I'm getting stuck in Qt.    The errors look like they are related to Webkit and the tests/examples.     Does it need to build with Webkit?     Or better yet, how to I get the Superbuild to not build Webkit, examples and tests?        There's a file pv-qt-configure.cmake where I can set some flags, but it keeps getting overwritten if I make changes to this file.    There must be a better way to do this!   8-)


FYI - here is the error I seen on my RHEL6 cluster build:

Try changing the flags in Source/Prohects/qt.cmake instead. For my
info, what are the flags that you're setting. Maybe we can change the
default setup itself.

I'll try modifying the files as you suggest.  I've used Superbuild on
numerous systems to build 3.98.1 and I have not run into this particular QT
issue.  This is also one of the first (the first?) RHEL6 cluster that I've
tried to build on. 

Given the error messages, I thought that the easiest workaround would be to
throw some flags at the configuration script to avoid building WebKit,
examples and tests.    HOWEVER, it may be worth someone's effort to try to
figure out where the error messages are coming from and what's the correct
fix, rather than giggling the configuration command!   8-)

Try changing the flags in Source/Prohects/qt.cmake instead. For my info,
what are the flags that you're setting. Maybe we can change the default
setup itself.

Hi Lucas,

In my opinion, using multipiece to handle parallel decompositions of VTK
structured grids is currently the best way to go for ParaView Catalyst.

Rick,

You cannot avoid building WebKit for ParaView (the tests/examples sure
can be skipped). ParaView currently needs WebKit. I've been thinking
of making that optional and not build the help-subsystem if WebKit is
unavailable, but that hasn't happened yet.

Turns out that I can't get past this on the RHEL6 cluster --- I looked in Source/Projects/qt.cmake and these were already being set:

                      -nomake demos
                      -nomake examples

I added
                      -nomake tests

but it wasn't a workaround for the errors.    It's clearly some interaction between the webkit and libgstreamer.     I'd take an option to not build the webkit and eliminate the help-subsystem if that'll get me a clean build.

Rick,

You cannot avoid building WebKit for ParaView (the tests/examples sure
can be skipped). ParaView currently needs WebKit. I've been thinking
of making that optional and not build the help-subsystem if WebKit is
unavailable, but that hasn't happened yet.

Any ideas on a short-term solution on how I might get past this build issue?       I'd like to get a ParaView build on this platform!   8-)       I am able to get a clean build with Mesa turned on.    It's the GL build that's failing.

So I've built a recent git clone of ParaView on an RHEL 6 system, and
I too hit the webkit requirement.  (In fact, on my second build I'd
forgotten about it, so I got stalled on that myself.)

But I got a working/clean build by including the "qtwebkit" package.
Of course with RHEL, a lot of these packages aren't in the Redhat
repositories.  So, I found that by using the "epel" repository I
have access to that package.

Not that you don't know how to do this, but for others following the
thread, the I was able to add the "epel" respository with this
command:
	% su -c 'rpm -Uvh 
http://mirrors.nebo.edu/public/epel/5/x86_64/epel-release-5-4.noarch.rpm'

Of course, if there is a way to not include extras that require extra
package installs, that would be good too.

Right.  I understand, and fortunately for me, the systems I mostly work
on are in our group and I can basically install what I want.  If there's
any room for negotiation, the "epel" repository is somewhat semi-official,
kinda.

Otherwise then, I hope Utkarsh can remove the dependency!

Hi

You should be able to install the Qt libraries in any directory, I've 
been using 4.8.2 ( http://qt-project.org/downloads). Once you unpack the 
binaries into your desired location, you need to prepend 
PATH/LD_LIBRARY_PATH appropriately, and when building paravlew point to 
your install via pv's "qmake exe" variable. This worked for me.

Utkarsh:

Thanks! Works!

I had tried that: I thought it had not worked, because it (python?,
pvpython?) did not print to the screen from a test script.

Is there a way to print info to the screen (or to a specified file)? When I
use "Run Script" (to run show_vtu.py) from the python shell that is started
when Tools -> Python Shell is manually selected, prints to the screen work.

Thanks,
Tim

Hmmm, you are right, no longer binaries for 4.8! They used to be there. 
There are binaries for 5.0 but I guess that's not officially supported 
by vtk/pv. :-(

I have successfully run the serial Fortran examples using the same build of ParaView.

Hi Lucas,

Was there any output? What happens when you build the C++ example with
USE_CATALYST set to OFF?

I'm not having any issues on my workstation with that example with the
latest version of ParaView and Catalyst examples so I'll need a bit of help
diagnosing the problem.

Thanks,
Andy

I should also add that the Fortran sample script hasn't been updated yet to
ParaView head but the CxxFullExample sample script has. That's a
possibility between the two.

Subject: [Paraview] d3 poor domain decomposition
Message-ID: <518C331B.5030509@lbl.gov>

I wanted to report a situation where D3 is generating really poor domain 
decomposition. In this case it's taking decent data locality and 
destroying it. This is a multiblock with 8 polydata surfaces. Screen 
shot shows result with 4 mpi ranks, 8 produces a similar result. D3 
usually does a great job, so maybe this has hit some of its weak spots. 
I'm surprised that there are so many disconnected regions on each rank 
and that it doesn't retain any of the initial data locality. Although 
here I was just experimenting trying to get a more even data 
distribution by using d3, I think similar use cases arise frequently. 
for example the need to re-balancing the data distribution after an 
iso-surface in parallel. Should this be considered a bug?

Hi Tim,

ParaView reassigns sys.stdout so that output can be routed to the ParaView
python console window.  Your script could set stdout back to the original
value:

import sys
sys.stdout = sys.__stdout__
sys.stderr = sys.__stderr__

For documentation, see:

http://docs.python.org/2/library/sys.html#sys.stdout

you can use the "Warp Scalar" filter to warp your 2D domain in the z

Subject: [Paraview] Correct ActiveMQ server version or config with
	ParaviewWeb SuperBuild
Message-ID: <CAFgey_8V2kJPzmfG4aJ8DZEGxjYdiW8B=+8Lan_QyjGE=kFK+g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi there,

I've succesfully compiled and deployed ParaViewWeb upto the point that I
can login as admin on localhost:8080/PWService

However, all visualization fail and the root cause seems to be with the
message broker. I've tried starting different versions of ActiveMQ (3.1,
4.1.2, 5.3.2, 5.5.1 and 5.7.0) but all fail. Should the broker be
configured and not just started from the vanilla binary installation
package?

The error message I get in the logs or on the command line is as follows:

./PWServer.sh
Error message: This producer can only send messages to:
kitware.paraweb.viewupdates

Any ideas how to proceed from here? Thanks.

Hi Antti,

if you have built ParaViewWeb from ParaView/master from git, you already
have the newest version of ParaViewWeb available to you inside ParaView
proper.

That new version of ParaViewWeb does not require any thirdparty component
such as activemq.
In fact, if you install https://github.com/senchalabs/jsduck and turn ON
the WEB_DOCUMENTATION inside CMake, ParaView will automatically generate a
full web site with all the new documentation for ParaViewWeb. Just search
for a 'www' directory inside your build or install tree.

In fact, if you download any nightly binary from our web site, they already
come with ParaViewWeb available (No need to compile it anymore...). Only
the windows binaries does not contains the Web documentation, but you can
get the web pages from any other system, and those will work just fine.

A real announcement for that new version with documentation update and so
on will happen at the release of ParaVIew 4.0.

Seb

In-Reply-To: <518C331B.5030509@lbl.gov>
Message-ID: <CDB26553.17999%kmorel@sandia.gov>

I am guessing that this has to do with the blocks in your multiblock dataset.  The D3 filter will partition each block independently.  This means that each process will have a small region in each partition, which will be spread throughout the dataset.

Although not a good solution, one way around the problem would be to first run the merge blocks filters to construct a monolithic unstructured grid, and then run D3.

Subject: [Paraview] Overlapped legend and axis in coprocessing when two
 views are exported
Message-ID: <65F8B323A072504ABFC5D3D8751910514B215988@MAIL-MBX2.ad.renci.org>

I observed when I build a pipeline that includes two slice views and export it for coprocessing that output both views, the coprocessing with such a pipeline will output two slice views with legend and axis in the output images overlapped. See attached two images for details. The slices are not overlapped but only the axis and color legend are overlapped. If I only output one view, this overlapping will not occur, so it only occurs when I export both views.

Thanks for any comments on this problem,

Hong

Message-ID: <65F8B323A072504ABFC5D3D8751910514B2159E6@MAIL-MBX2.ad.renci.org>

I found the contours of bubbles do not appear in the output image in coprocessing although the slices appear as expected in the output image. I see bubble contours when setting up the pipeline in paraview client, so I know bubbles are there, but bubble contours do not appear in the output image by coprocessing. I tried to add a writer to write out contour output to see whether contouring itself happens or not, but only "Parallel MultiBlockDataSet writer" is enabled in "writers" menu for coprocessing, so I got an error "Input for connection index 0 on input port index 0 for algorithm vtkXMLPMultiBlockDataWriter is of type vtkPolyData, but a vtkMultiBlockDataSet is required" from vtkPVCompositeDataPipleline, so I cannot use this only enabled writer to write out vtkPolydata output for the bubble contour. It could be that contouring happened in coprocessing, but somehow did not get captured in the rendering image output. Since I cannot add a writer to write out contouring output, I cannot be sure about it, but I did not get any error from contouring. Wondering whether anybody has run into this problem before.

Thanks,

Hong

Message-ID: <518D2D12.3060403@gmail.com>

I'm currently using the csv writer to create a CSV file for subsets of 
data, then reading those csv files in to generate the numpy arrays for 
additional analysis, report generation, etc.

Is it possible to bypass the csv step, and directly convert the point 
data to numpy arrays?

A separate, but related question has to do with the file naming for CSV 
files. If I save data to slice.csv, Paraview will write to slice0.csv, 
(and sometimes slice1.csv, slice2.csv, etc.). Usually the other files 
are empty, but since the name passed to the csv writer is different from 
the name of the csv file that I have to read in, I'm having to change 
the name in the script. Is there an option to force Paraview to only 
write to a single CSV file? Is there a limit to the number of rows of 
data per file?

Thanks,

Tony

Hi Ken,

Thanks for the help, you're right D3 is dividing each "dataset". looking 
at the vtm file for this dataset, which was produced by saving from an 
extract surface filter that was run on a grouped set of 8 vts datasets 
while running pv in client-server with 8 ranks. In the vtm file each 
"piece" has 8 vtu "datasets". So d3 is seeing what appears in the gui to 
be an 8 block multiblock dataset as 64 items to divide individually, so 
running with 4 ranks this produces 256 regions. When the surface data is 
generated in serial with only one "dataset" per "piece" in the vtm file 
it works wonderfully.

While exploring this I've noticed that sometimes after d3 some geometry 
is being dropped, not sure if that's occuring in d3 or some point after, 
filed a bug report about that. http://paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=14061

This is my own experience too.

Question: What would you like to see in the output


1)      Existing behaviour, each block is partitioned separately, previous multiblock structure is preserved

2)      All blocks partitioned as a single block, no multiblock structure in the output

3)      All blocks partitioned as a single block, multiblock structure from input regenerated based on a block Id assigned to each cell prior to partitioning.

The reason I ask is because I'm working on a new partitioning class and I have not yet handled multi-block datasets and I wonder what ought to be done in this case. 3) seems ideal, but is a bit harder and might use some intermediate memory that would be undesireable.

Hi John,

In hind sight I think d3 is doing something reasonable. you have quite a 
few use cases to support. when blocks are only a vehicle for 
parallelism, the block structure doesn't matter and could be ignored or 
done away with. when blocks describe physical structures, assemblies, 
parts of  a machines and so on,  you will have to retain the full 
heirarchy. perhaps a data partitioner could make a better decomposition 
if there was a way to let the user choose which level of structure he 
wants to retain and do the best it can within that constraint...

In my case ParaView had saved unexpected sub-block partitions, 1 dataset 
per rank within each block, in the vtm file based on how many ranks were 
running at the time i extracted the surface (8 ranks x 8 blocks = 64 sub 
block partitions in the vtm file). But when that file is loaded in PV it 
shows no evidence of this, both composite index and process id 
correspond to the original 8 blocks. However d3 partitioned each of 
those sub-block partitions. in my case 4 ranks 64 sub blocks = 256 
partitions in all! definitely not what I expected and I guess its a 
worst case scenario for d3. I don't care about sub block partitioning 
structure that PV used when I saved the data. But there's no way the 
writer, reader, or d3 could know that.

Subject: [Paraview] How to intersect two datasets with ParaView
Message-ID: <1368350664.17522.4.camel@WMS005>

Hello there! 

I wonder how to get the intersection two datasets in ParaView? 

What I have are:
 * A dataset covering the worlds coastlines
(http://www.earthmodels.org/data-and-tools/coastlines)
 * And the actual dataset, a 3d spherical section of the Earth (central
Europa to a 1000km depth) as a structured curvilinear grid in the NetCDF
file format
What I want to do is to cut out coastlines to the extends of the
spherical section. I just want to have coastlines at that region which
is covered by the spherical section (the rest of the Earth's coastlines
I want to leave out). 
Is there a way to achieve that with ParaView? 

Thanks for your help! 
Cheers, 
Stefan

Hi Burlen,

This sounds like a good use case for handling multi-block and multi-piece
differently. The intent of multi-piece was to be a vehicle for parallelism
(or other reasons for partitioning data) whereas multi-block was to
represent intentional hierarchies. We haven't taken this to its logical
conclusion so we are a bit in limbo when it comes to differentiating the
two. I would encourage folks to think about this and move this
functionality forward where it makes sense. It is definitely on my to do
list to make progress on this within the next year or two.

In the case of D3, it should be doable to have D3 treat multi-piece
datasets as one thing and repartition the whole thing freely across MPI
ranks.

Best,
-berk

I would directly insert my array into the source filter.  The following 
example is a ParaView macro:

     script = """
     pdo = self.GetPolyDataOutput()
     newPts = vtk.vtkPoints()
     for x in [(1,1,1),(0,0,1),(0,1,0),(1,0,0)]:
         newPts.InsertNextPoint(x)
     lines = vtk.vtkCellArray()
     for c in [[0,1,2,3,0],[0,2],[1,3]]:
         lines.InsertNextCell(len(c))
         for i in c:
             lines.InsertCellPoint(i)
     pdo.SetLines(lines)
     pdo.SetPoints(newPts)
     assert len(array) == pdo.GetNumberOfPoints()
     varray = vtk.vtkDoubleArray();
     varray.SetName(%r)
     for x in %r:
         varray.InsertNextValue(x)
     pdo.GetPointData().AddArray(varray)
     """
     name = "myarray"
     array = [1,2,3,4]
     src = ProgrammableSource(
          OutputDataSetType='vtkPolyData',
          Script=(script % (name, array)))
     Show(src)

Sorry, but it is - not what I want to see. Your method will not work quick with huge arrays.  I need to access to the arrays. Any ideas?

The only other idea I have is to load the information directly from the programmable source. 

I once wrote a programmable source that queried an external process to populate data arrays.

Hi Utkarsh,

there is a still problems with animation output with the latest git-version.

Hi Andy,

Thanks for looking into this. I am using ParaView version 3.98.1 and the attached is the co-processing script that I used. Let me know if you have any further questions or find something I did not do correctly.

Thanks again,

Hong

Hi

Thanks for the suggestion, Paul. However I'm not convinced that this is the
problem.

As stated glxgears (and ElmerGUI, etc) works. This is using the libGL.so
from libgl1-mesa-swx11, so mesa it self seems to be working.

Also, because of things out of my hands, I can only connect to the machine
using Windows Remote Desktop so I cannot choose the vncviewer as I please.

Any further help is appreciated, thanks

Torben

Subject: [Paraview] vtkTable Visualization
Message-ID: <000001ce4fe8$303af420$90b0dc60$@tu-cottbus.de>

Hello,

I try to visualize a vtkTable with SpreadSheetView, Parallel CoordinatesView
and PlotMatrixView and observe some strange behavior while making a
selection of a certain row. To demonstrate the problem I've create to
scenarios: 

### Scenario 1 with a ProgrammableSource and a Muliblock(vtkTable) output:

NumCols = 15
NumRows = 100
math = vtk.vtkMath()
pdo = self.GetOutput()
table = vtk.vtkTable()
for di in range(0, NumCols):
 d = vtk.vtkDoubleArray() 
 d.SetName("Data Column {0}".format(di))
 d.SetNumberOfValues(NumRows)
 for dv in range(0, NumRows):     
    d.SetValue(dv, math.Random() * NumRows)
 table.AddColumn(d)
pdo.SetBlock(0, table)

#################################################

### Scenario 2 with a ProgrammableSource and a vtkTable output:

NumCols = 15
NumRows = 100
math = vtk.vtkMath()
pdo = self.GetTableOutput()
for di in range(0, NumCols):
 d = vtk.vtkDoubleArray() 
 d.SetName("Data Column {0}".format(di))
 d.SetNumberOfValues(NumRows)
 for dv in range(0, NumRows):     
    d.SetValue(dv, math.Random() * NumRows)
 pdo.AddColumn(d)

They both produce tables with same structure. The first Source encapsulate
it within a multi block set. This is being visualized as shown on the
screenshot (see attached). 

When I start to select a row the SpreaSheetView in both cases the PlotView
and ParallelCoordinatesView highlights their corresponding data sets (as
expected). But after clicking in the active plot view (in the multi block
scenario 1) an Debug message occurs which says: "Uneven size for values."
and the changed selection is not being propagated to the other views. This
happens only in the Scenario 1 (multi block). In scenario 2 (direct vtkTable
output) I still can select a point in the active plot view after selecting a
row in the spread sheet. 

Another observation is, that the active plot view recognize a single item
selection (single right-mouse-click) only in scenario 1 but not scenario 2.
Here I have to draw small rectangle to select one data point.

Can anyone reproduces this behavior?


Best regards,
Stephan

Peiying,

I believe you are looking for the advanced panel in the properties tab.  We have been trying to decrease the default complexity of the properties tab.  On the properties tab, just below the ? mark to the right of the delete button is a gear icon.  Click that.

In earlier version, it was obvious how to rotate and/or translate objects, including stl geometries.  But, it is not clear to me how this can be done in paraview-3.98.  Can some one point to me a direction?

Thanks!

This was just off the top of my head - some back ground, we have ParaView
working through TurboVNC/VirtualGL nicely on a Centos 5.8 HPC GPU cluster.
We have another project building a cloud version - as we don't have GPU's
yet it is using Mesa (though I have not tried ParaView but know TurboVNC
works with Mesa).

 

If it is just ParaView and nothing else maybe it is the build? A quick
google shows there are some tricks:

 

http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/ParaView_And_Mesa_3D

 

Sorry I can't be more help.

 

Cheers,

 

Paul

Hi

 

Thanks for the suggestion, Paul. However I'm not convinced that this is the
problem.

 

As stated glxgears (and ElmerGUI, etc) works. This is using the libGL.so
from libgl1-mesa-swx11, so mesa it self seems to be working.

 

Also, because of things out of my hands, I can only connect to the machine
using Windows Remote Desktop so I cannot choose the vncviewer as I please.

 

Any further help is appreciated, thanks

 

Torben

Checkout TurboVNC/VirtualGL - pretty sure it can be built with mesa if no
GPU is available.

Hi All

 

I'm trying to make paraview run over vnc (and xrdp)

 

I'm using default build from debian wheezy with libgl1-mesa-swx11

 

I have GLX (glxgears) and VTK (simple Python VTK example) working but
paraview shows just the splash screen and the error;

 

X Error: BadDrawable (invalid Pixmap or Window parameter) 9

  Major opcode: 62 (X_CopyArea)

  Resource id:  0x0

 

and nothing else happens.

 

If I run it as

$ ssh -X localhost paraview

still inside the VNC session it seems to work fine

 

What do I need to make it work directly?

 

Thanks

Regards

Torben

Thanks for the suggestion. I used instruments.app on paraview while it was
hanging. Using the spin monitor, there were many different processes which
were hanging. Most of the time was spent on these operations:
libdispatch.dylib: _dispatch_mgr_wakeup
libsystem.dylib:  start_wqthread

Less time was spent during these calls,
libvtkPVServerManagerCore-pv3.98.1.dylib: vtkSMProxy::GetProperty(char
const*, int)
libsystem_c.dylib: szone_free_definite_size (on a number of objects in
QTCore and libvtkpqCore)

Time spend in other parts of the code are under 5% each. If it's helpful I
can provide a dump of all the calls captured by Instruments.

If anybody has any new suggestions, I'd appreciate it.

James

This is not supported nor recommended. The two entitites work in
separate contexts. The code to fill up that array that you want to
pass may itself be moved to within the Programmable Source's Script
and that maybe a better approach.

Hi Hong,

I didn't see anything wrong with your script. Something else you could try
is creating two separate scripts; one for each render view and see if the
problem persists.

Hi Andy,

I already tried that and this problem does not happen if there is only one render view in the script. From my testing, it seems the problem only happens when the script includes two render views. You mentioned earlier that you could not reproduce this problem in the ParaView head version. I am wondering whether you can reproduce this problem in the version 3.98.1. Also, I have problem in getting isocontours included in the output image in coprocessing (for details, see a separate email I sent out). Are you aware of any problem related to including isocontours in the output image in coprocessing in version 3.98.1?

Many thanks for looking into this!

Hong

Subject: [Paraview] Modify an existing filter
Message-ID: <CALMCgcLbw1BUekufPbJY5P3DoB7JfgjCt=iBoWG58FbxS8Ya2Q@mail.gmail.com>

I'm new to ParaView and I'm trying to use it to visualize 2D discrete
element data.

I'm running into situations where I want more of the glyph properties to be
dependent on inputs (a line glyph whose length, *and* width are scaled by
different inputs, e.g.). So far I haven't been able to find filters to
accomplish this. 'Tube' is the closest thing I've found, but it only
renders in 3D and looks out of place with my 2D data.

Is it possible to modify a filter with a programmable filter? Would I need
a plugin to do this kind of thing?

Attached is an example of the kind of diagram I'm trying to make. I made
this one using matplotlib.

Thanks for your help,

Lorne

Message-ID: <CA+BuKJJPRNLvR13M=OBMU_2=NnkVPqSTUC_DAGpiR3p_nrK3CA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I just started using Python scripting for paraview. I have a 3d plot from
which I want to take a line plot and then compute the fourier transform of
the data in the line plot.

1. What is the best way to get the coordinates and the values of the
variable in the line plot.
2. Is it possible to do this completely with GUI(if yes, I can just trace
the calls to get a python script from what I unnderstand so far)?
3. Is there a better/direct way to do the fourier transform along a line
using vtk classes?

I hope the question is not too vague.

Thanks,
Sheshu

Hi,

I decided to attach a pv state file to reproduce this issue. The left  
side visualizes the (multiblock) encapsulated vtkTable output of a  
ProgrammableSource with a SpreadSheet-, MatrixPlot- and  
ParallelCoordinatesView. The same view types were used for the direct  
vtkTable output of a ProgrammableSouce (right).

Steps to reproduce the problem with PV git master version:

1. Load attached State file

For the left views:
2. First select an item in the left active plot view (MatrixPlotView)  
with a right mouse click (no drag) => Should work 3. Select a line in  
the SpreadSheetView => Should work; the selection is propagated over  
all views (on the same side) 4. Now repeat step 2. => Message: "Uneven  
size of values." occurs and the selection is not being propagated to  
the other views 5. Select a range in the ParallelCoordinates View =>  
Same message as in step 4. is shown

For the right views:
2. First select an item in the right active plot view (MatrixPlotView)  
with a right mouse click (no drag) => Does not work; I have to click  
an drag 3. Select a line in the SpreadSheetView => Should work; the  
selection is propagated over all views (on the same side) 4. Now  
repeat step 2. => Should word 5. Select a range in the  
ParallelCoordinates View => Should work

Hope that someone could reproduce this.

Cheers,
Stephan

I would like to use the Verdict element metrics in ParaView, but I am not
sure how to use them through the ParaView interface. Specifically, I want
to compute the edge lengths if an unstructured grid. This seems to be
possible using the verdict function 'V_edge_metric' which is in the VTK
utilities library.

Any help, or pointers to the correct documentation would be greatly
appreciated.

You can do just about anything you can do with a c++ filter (make internal
filters, directly access input and output data sets) inside a programmable
filter so a plugin shouldn't be a requirement to do what you want to do. In
either case you will need to be familiar with the VTK API, python usually
just makes the development task a bit quicker.

I would recommend you start by reimplementing what the tube filter does in
its requestdata method in python and then modify to suit your purposes.

The arrowGlyph plugin has some more options for controlling arrows, you might get some ideas from it on how to change different params using different scalar on the input (you say different inputs, but I suspect you mean different field vars)

Subject: [Paraview] Modify an existing filter

I'm new to ParaView and I'm trying to use it to visualize 2D discrete element data.

I'm running into situations where I want more of the glyph properties to be dependent on inputs (a line glyph whose length, and width are scaled by different inputs, e.g.). So far I haven't been able to find filters to accomplish this. 'Tube' is the closest thing I've found, but it only renders in 3D and looks out of place with my 2D data.

Is it possible to modify a filter with a programmable filter? Would I need a plugin to do this kind of thing?

Attached is an example of the kind of diagram I'm trying to make. I made this one using matplotlib.

Thanks for your help,

Lorne

Thanks for the information. I'm starting to work on understanding the VTK
API and going through some examples of programmable filters.

I'll take a look at the tube filter and post an update when/if I get things
figured out.

Thanks again,

Lorne

Thanks, John. I will look into the arrowGlyph plugin.

And, yes, you interpreted my question correctly.

Thank you,

Hello,
I am new to paraview. 
I have a vtk file with the solution of a 2D flow in a channel. 
I can plot a cross section of the velocity at a given position
in the streamflow direction using the filter "Plot Over Line".
I would like to have on the same graphic cross sections of 
the velocity at different locations. 
How can I do that ?
Thank in advance !

I believe you could just create multiple plot over line filters on the original data, placing the line for each  filter in different places.  Then, select the 2d plot view for the original plot over line, and turn on visibility for all of the plot over line filters to this one view   finally, just delete the 2d views that you don't need.

Rick,

I've pushed a fix to git-master to allow disabling QtWebKit. Turn on
cmake option PQWIDGETS_DISABLE_QTWEBKIT and ParaView will not longer
look for QtWebKit when configuring/building.

Utkarsh - thanks for the update.   Is there (or will there be) a corresponding flag in the Superbuild to enable/disable webkit?   Also, I presume that this is for version 4 and not applied to 3.98.1?

Message-ID: <CABomCWFxD6-moNOfX0Su2yp6teT6QNgvVQVKTTd1TH9j_d08pw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

  I have a MPI programme that split the 3D space into blocks. Therefore,
each block is output as a .vti file.
 I can visualize each block in Paraview, but cannot visualize them together.
I guess i need a .pvti file, but not sure how the file looks like. Anyone
can send me a simple example showing how to visualize such a goup of files
together?

Thank you.

I am writing a pvpython script which takes a pvd, applies an integrate  
variables filter, then uses a programmable filter to scale out the  
length, area, or volume (depending on whether the data is 1,2, or 3d)  
from each of the point data, then finally applies a plot selection  
over time filter to the result. It works fine most of the time, but  
occasionally the programmable filter gives the following error:

Traceback (most recent call last):
   File "<string>", line 26, in <module>
   File "<string>", line 23, in RequestData
   File  
"/Applications/ParaView.app/Contents/Python/paraview/vtk/dataset_adapter.py",  
line 196, in append
     arr = numpyTovtkDataArray(narray, name)
   File  
"/Applications/ParaView.app/Contents/Python/paraview/vtk/dataset_adapter.py",  
line 53, in numpyTovtkDataArray
     vtkarray = numpy_support.numpy_to_vtk(array)
   File  
"/Applications/ParaView.app/Contents/Python/paraview/numpy_support.py", line  
160, in numpy_to_vtk
     result_array.SetVoidArray(z_flat, len(z_flat), 1)
TypeError: argument 1: value is _c_A
W5 at k5?, required type is void_p

The error is occurring in the last line of the script which is below.  
I'm not sure where to start looking for problems since the data I am  
using seems fine. Any suggestions? Thanks!

All the best
Colin

Ben,
I don't know what a pvti file looks like, but I bet it is close to a pvtp file.  Here is an example of a pvtp file:

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<VTKFile type="PPolyData" version="0.1" byte_order="LittleEndian" compressor="vtkZLibDataCompressor">
  <PPolyData GhostLevel="0">
    <PCellData Scalars="temperature">
      <PDataArray type="Float32" Name="cell_scalars" format="ascii"/>
      <PDataArray type="Float32" Name="cell_normals" format="ascii"/>
    </PCellData>
    <PPoints>
       <PDataArray type="Float32" NumberOfComponents="3" format="ascii"/>
    </PPoints>
    <Piece Source="samplePolyDataTris.vtp"/>

Hi everyone,

  I have a MPI programme that split the 3D space into blocks. Therefore, each block is output as a .vti file.
 I can visualize each block in Paraview, but cannot visualize them together.
I guess i need a .pvti file, but not sure how the file looks like. Anyone can send me a simple example showing how to visualize such a goup of files together?

Thank you.

Load a large image using pvservers>1, then save it from the main file menu using the vti format selection from the drop down combo. Then paraview will write >1 vti files and one pvti file to bind them. You can experiment with this way and see what you need.

Message-ID: <CAM8bWRzRm5kA5x+Twy-O87wHhmcoLum4RiD4LDK57pibP56vnA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi.

I'm using Paraview 3.14, or even, 3.98 to visualize the deformation field
and respective glyphs of an .vtk or .mha images.
After open them, I 'Apply' to visualize the MetaImage, which has float as
Data Type and [-21.5289, 21.3233], [-22.1109, 21.6821], [0, 0] as Data
Ranges. Then, I use the Calculator with MetaImage_X*iHat+MetaImage_Y*jHat,
resulting an image with double as data type and [-21.5289, 21.3233],
[-22.1109, 21.6821], [0, 0] as data ranges. Finally, I apply the Glyph
filter with the following properties:

Vectors = results
Glyph Type = 2D Glyph

     Glyph Type = Arrow

And the other properties used are the default ones.

As final result, I can see an image (attached in the email) with the glyphs
approximatelly along the original X axis, but the Y axis was resized, and
the glyphs shown are restricted, and not approximatelly along the original
Y axis. Why is that occuring?

Thanks for your help!

Hi, Raquel,

It is tough to know exactly what is going on without knowing all of the details of the data and the filter settings used, but there are two potential things that initially come to mind. 

One is the Mask Points checkbox for the glyph filter.  If this is on and your data set is large it could be that you are only showing a subset of the glyphs, which all happen to be close to the minimum Y value.

The other is the Scale Mode for the glyphs.  Based on the size of the glyphs and the colors in the MetaImage Magnitude color scale I would have to guess that you are scaling the glyphs by some other value and not the MetaImage Magnitude (otherwise the blue arrows would be the smallest and the red would be the largest, which is not the case in your image).  Try setting the Scale Mode to off.

Hope that's helpful,
joe

Subject: [Paraview] Help for DataObjectGenerator
Message-ID: <CAB8-E4C8Ci+uLMm1xcxR+CXr2MF-1hQ6ngeuFOHyK35XYM5jTg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Paraview users,

I would like to create, from a script file, some data (lines) with
python/vtk instructions and display the result for a Paraview client.

I know I can do it with Programmable Source.
The wiki page here gives some examples
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Simple_ParaView_3_Python_Filters

However, this presents several drawback for me.
- The code might be long, and is not easily maintenable as it is stored as
a single string, when doing some batch operations
- I need to give some input arguments to this code
- I have some python functions

Therefore, I have tried to do it with DataObjectGenerator, but I can not
use it properly.
I use the comand servermanager.Fetch to retrieve data, I manage to modify
it.
Next step would be to ask Paraview to propagate modifications, and display
the new data.
But I dont know how to do it.
Any advice?

I know some people had the same problem, but I can not figure out the
solution
http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.science.paraview.user/10879

Below is my Python code, that does not work: the final result is not
displayed on screen.

try: paraview.simple
except: from paraview.simple import *
paraview.simple._DisableFirstRenderCameraReset()
from paraview import vtk

p= DataObjectGenerator(Program='PD1')
p.UpdatePipeline()
output = servermanager.Fetch(p)
output.Initialize()
newPts = vtk.vtkPoints()
numPts=5
newPts.InsertPoint(0, 0.0,0.0,0.0)
newPts.InsertPoint(1, 0.0,0.0,5.0)
newPts.InsertPoint(2, 5.0,0.0,5.0)
newPts.InsertPoint(3, 5.0,5.0,5.0)
newPts.InsertPoint(4, 5.0,9.0,7.0)
output.SetPoints(newPts)
aPolyLine = vtk.vtkPolyLine()
aPolyLine.GetPointIds().SetNumberOfIds(numPts)
[aPolyLine.GetPointIds().SetId(i, i) for i in range(0,numPts)]
output.Allocate(1, 1)
output.InsertNextCell(aPolyLine.GetCellType(), aPolyLine.GetPointIds())
print(output)
p.UpdatePipeline()
Render()
Show()
dp=GetDisplayProperties(p)
dp.DiffuseColor=[0.0,0.0,0.0]

Hi, all.

I hope to render vtkGraph in ParaView, which is available in VTK. The related classes are vtkGraphLayoutView, vtkRenderedGraphRepresentation. There is also a source class: vtkRandomGraphSource.

My plan is to realize a customized view for vtkGraph. As an experiment, there are at least 3 things to to: 
1. a source for vtkGraph, which is the easiest part. Just load a xml file wrapping vtkRandomGraphSource.
2. a view. May be a subclass of vtkPVRenderView, with its RenderView replaced by vtkGraphLayoutView. I have tried that, and the view shows in MainWindow, but I don't know if it really works.
3. a representation. vtkGraphLayoutView uses vtkRenderedGraphRepresentation by default. But I don't know how to use this representation class in ParaView, only find that every representation class in  Paraview is derived from vtkPVDataRepresentation.

I am trying to write a custumized grapg view according to my plan. Before everything is done, I have to figure out how view and representaion work in Paraview. 

My questions are:
1. Does my plan works? Is there any aspect I have ignored? 
2. How to use a vtk representation class in Paraview?
3. What is the best way to visualize graph in Paraview?

Any advices will be appreciated!

Yes, I just pushed a flag to Superbuild (qt_DISABLE_WEBKIT -- an
advanced cmake option) to disable WebKit in Qt and ParaView built by
the Superbuild. And yes, this is indeed for 4.0 and not for 3.98.*.

Hi,

We are currently working in bringing that VTK renderer + representation
into ParaView. Although, that work won't be available inside ParaView soon
as more effort need to be done toward a proper integration.
Although, if you are willing to go further on that matter, I can share that
piece of code that allow rendering within the python context of ParaView.

Seb

Hi, Seb

It's very kind of you to share the code, which will make me understand Paraview much better.

There is little information about cusomizing Paraview, so a workable example will be very useful.

Thanks again.

Dear Paraview users;

I use ParaView on windows 7 pro 64bit and mac os x at the same computer
using BootCamp.

I can use "Mobile Remote Control" between ParaView on mac os x and
Kiwiviewer on iPhone.
But I can not use it between windows and iphone.
"Connection failed" is displayed.

Let me know how to use Mobile Remote Control in windows and iphone.

Subject: [Paraview] Programmatic access to Probe Location point
Message-ID: <CDBFF921.16D31%reuterma@ornl.gov>

Hi,

I'm trying to programmatically (C++) access the point coordinates displayed by the property panel widget after the p key is pressed. I have a pqPipelineSource pointer from when I created the Probe Location filter, but I can't seem to find any properties (tried Point, Center, WorldPosition) on the proxy that work. I also tried accessing those properties via the source proxy, but no luck either. If the proxy has the information, what is the correct property name? If not, where do I need to be looking?

Thanks,

Hi,

It's a sub-proxy that is used to define the probe location. The name of
that is FixedRadiusPointSource. You can find that in filters.xml (partly
shown below). The proxy definition of FixedRadiusPointSource is in
utilities.xml (also partly shown below).

Hope this points you in the proper direction.

Thanks Sebastien,

the nightly build works nicely. We're using Jetty as a frontend. Where
would it be easiest to set Jetty's properties? When a larger model is
transferred to client in geometry form, the default max message size is met
pretty soon.

Message-ID: <004c01ce5610$29f683d0$7de38b70$@tu-cottbus.de>

Hello,

I use the SpreadSheetView to visualize a vtkTable. Now I want to fetch the
data of the row which is currently selected.
Right now I can connect to a selection event but have no idea to obtain the
slected data row.

pqSpreadSheetView *ssv = qobject_cast<pqSpreadSheetView*>(view);
QWidget *widget = ssv->getWidget();
QObject::connect(
     ssv->getViewModel(), SIGNAL(selectionChanged(const QItemSelection&)), 
      this, SLOT(spreadSheetSelectionChanged(const QItemSelection&)));

When my slot is called, QItemSelection is empty.

Cheers,
Stephan

The current version of the session manager based on Jetty is just a
starting point and depending on the deployment that you expect, you may
build your own.
In fact, there is still some work to be done if we want to make it bullet
proof. Although, using apache as a proxy and jetty as job launcher seems to
be pretty reliable.

But if you like the light weight and ease of deployment of the current
JettySessionManager, you may find a system based on Node.js as easy.
In fact, to provide a larger set of front-end technologies, we were
thinking to use Node.js for that as it seems to have built-in websocket and
http proxy/forwarding capabilities.

If you want to give a try, you can read
https://blog.nodejitsu.com/http-proxy-intro, and if you have something that
you are willing to share we can extend our "SessionManager" code base.

Thanks,

Seb

Sebastien

There used to be an infoviz plugin for paraview (I think). Is this what?s left of it or a different integration you?ve done separately?

It's very kind of you to share the code, which will make me understand Paraview much better.

There is little information about cusomizing Paraview, so a workable example will be very useful.

Thanks again.

Hi,

We are currently working in bringing that VTK renderer + representation into ParaView. Although, that work won't be available inside ParaView soon as more effort need to be done toward a proper integration.
Although, if you are willing to go further on that matter, I can share that piece of code that allow rendering within the python context of ParaView.

Seb

Hi, all.

I hope to render vtkGraph in ParaView, which is available in VTK. The related classes are vtkGraphLayoutView, vtkRenderedGraphRepresentation. There is also a source class: vtkRandomGraphSource.

My plan is to realize a customized view for vtkGraph. As an experiment, there are at least 3 things to to:
1. a source for vtkGraph, which is the easiest part. Just load a xml file wrapping vtkRandomGraphSource.
2. a view. May be a subclass of vtkPVRenderView, with its RenderView replaced by vtkGraphLayoutView. I have tried that, and the view shows in MainWindow, but I don't know if it really works.
3. a representation. vtkGraphLayoutView uses vtkRenderedGraphRepresentation by default. But I don't know how to use this representation class in ParaView, only find that every representation class in  Paraview is derived from vtkPVDataRepresentation.

I am trying to write a custumized grapg view according to my plan. Before everything is done, I have to figure out how view and representaion work in Paraview.

My questions are:
1. Does my plan works? Is there any aspect I have ignored?
2. How to use a vtk representation class in Paraview?
3. What is the best way to visualize graph in Paraview?

Any advices will be appreciated!

This work it totally unrelated. And it has to do with ParaViewWeb vtkGraph
based application. ;-)

ParaView is not using VTK-master yet. It will be switched to use
VTK-master only after the 4.0 release. We will be updating the testing
then.

I have always done a 'git pull' on VTKData, VTKLargeData, and
ParaViewData before I run my dashboard scripts.

The last commits in VTKData and VTKLargeData emptied out these directories.

Should I check out the versions just before the external data change and
stop updating them?

Anton,

The bug was when using system OGGTHEORA support. I've a fix that
should go into master after the next gatekeeper review.

Thanks for catching this.

Subject: [Paraview] Scalar components and Python Calculator
Message-ID: <C7ACF6F2C9304A4C81EAC2E2C96B5E165F1F1C87@EXMB01.drc.com>

Hello,

I am trying to use the Python Calculator on 2 different Scalar components in the same data file.

I have written the real and imaginary parts of a Fortran complex data type to a single ".raw" binary file. ParaView correctly opens this file when I tell it that there are 2 scalar components.

I can use the Calculator to perform calculations on the "X" and "Y" components (the real gets imported by default as ImageData_X and the imaginary as ImageData_Y). An expression in the Calculator filter such as:

sqrt(ImageData_X^2 + ImageData_Y^2)

works fine. The Python Calculator, however, generates an error that ImageData_X and ImageData_Y are not defined.

Both filters are set to Point Data.

Any suggestions?

Thanks
Lucas

I have a map on which I've placed numerous glyphs (circles at earthquake locations).  I'd like to change the colors of the circles individually, and maybe the continent outlines as well. I also want to add some more data, maybe triangles, with a different color. I haven't figured out how to change the glyph color without changing the color of everything else.

Subject: [Paraview] How to use vtk sequence of files to animate them?
Message-ID: <1369261004.37853.YahooMailNeo@web161802.mail.bf1.yahoo.com>

Hello,

Thus far this is what I've accomplished with Paraview but I cannot seem to get my animation to run properly as I will explain at the end.

1. I took a sequence of 30 vtk format files made by Athena (MHD numerical software) and imported all of them into paraview.
2. I added every single one of them to the animation view.
3. I changed each vtk grid to only run for 1 second and each vtk is a frame with 30 seconds and 30 frames total.
??? Basically frame 1 is before frame 2 and so on and none of them overlap in time.
4. I noticed that toggling a? "eye" in the pipeline browser turns off specific vtk grids in the 3d viewer and for some reason this is where things don't work.

If I select all of the "eyes" and turn them on only the last one turned on causes the selected 3d vtk grid to appear. I can only render that image when I
try to animate all the 30 frames using file->save animation->avi. I expect that at each frame every second a different grid would show and get animated.

Please feel free to ask more questions regarding my setup. I would post screenshots but the mailing list is archaic as this is 2013 and better alternatives exist now.

Andrew

Hi Utkarsh,

thanks for fixing that! But there are some problems with  missing path:

-----------
ParaViewCore/ServerManager/Default/vtkSMAnimationSceneImageWriter.cxx:49:32:
fatal error: vtkFFMPEGWriter.h: No such file or directory
-----------

Also, it seems, VTK/IO/FFMPEG/vtkFFMPEGWriter.cxx needs som fixing. For example,
avcodec_open() is not persist any more. There is avcodec_is_open instead.

Thank you,

Anton

minor, the font size for contours is extremely small, would it be 
possible to increase the default value closer to the source text font size.

Can you explain me how to get rid of this error? Thanks in advance!

Message-ID: <005c01ce57b3$9476a8d0$bd63fa70$@tu-cottbus.de>

Ok, rather than fetching the vtkTable's data directly I read out the "Row
Id" of the selected row in my SpreadSheetView. This is done by connecting to
the "pqView::selected (pqOutputPort* opp)" signal to my slot "pqMyPanel::
selectionChanged(pqOutputPort* opp)". The slot read the specific "IDs":

void pqMUDIIPanel::selectionChanged(pqOutputPort* opp)
{
  if (opp)
    {
    vtkSMSourceProxy *activeSelection = opp->getSelectionInput();  
   if(activeSelection)
      {
      vtkSMVectorProperty* vp = 
          vtkSMVectorProperty::SafeDownCast(
activeSelection->GetProperty("IDs"));    
     QList<QVariant> ids = pqSMAdaptor::getMultipleElementProperty(vp);
      if(!strcmp(activeSelection->GetXMLName(),
"CompositeDataIDSelectionSource"))
        {
        this->SelectedRowId = ids.at(2).toInt();         
        }
      }
   }
}

The "Row Id" can be used to work within the table on pure VTK-level via
proxy properties. Hope this could help someone with a similar question.

Cheers,
Stephan

Betreff: Fetching selection from SpreadSheet

Hello,

I use the SpreadSheetView to visualize a vtkTable. Now I want to fetch the
data of the row which is currently selected.
Right now I can connect to a selection event but have no idea to obtain the
slected data row.

pqSpreadSheetView *ssv = qobject_cast<pqSpreadSheetView*>(view);
QWidget *widget = ssv->getWidget();
QObject::connect(
     ssv->getViewModel(), SIGNAL(selectionChanged(const QItemSelection&)), 
      this, SLOT(spreadSheetSelectionChanged(const QItemSelection&)));

When my slot is called, QItemSelection is empty.

Cheers,
Stephan

Message-ID: <005e01ce57b7$56386050$02a920f0$@tu-cottbus.de>

Hello again.

Hm, I think I locate the problem. Debuging pqPlotMatrixView's base class pqContextView::setSelection(vtkSelection* sel) have a problem with existing selections on a multi block encapsulate vtkTable. 

I was able to make this observation within pqContextView::setSelection(vtkSelection* sel):
When I select a row in a SpreadSheetView of the multi block encapsulated vtkTable the active selection is a "CompositeDataIDSelectionSource". This source holds a property named "IDs" which returns 3 elements per command. However, this method fills only 2 elements per command to its IDs-property. I guess selection to this view should allways return "IDSelectionSource". So maybe the selection-source types were mixed up. 

Best regards,
Stephan

Betreff: Re: vtkTable Visualization

Hi,

I decided to attach a pv state file to reproduce this issue. The left side visualizes the (multiblock) encapsulated vtkTable output of a ProgrammableSource with a SpreadSheet-, MatrixPlot- and ParallelCoordinatesView. The same view types were used for the direct vtkTable output of a ProgrammableSouce (right).

Steps to reproduce the problem with PV git master version:

1. Load attached State file

For the left views:
2. First select an item in the left active plot view (MatrixPlotView) with a right mouse click (no drag) => Should work 
3. Select a line in the SpreadSheetView => Should work; the selection is propagated over all views (on the same side) 
4. Now repeat step 2. => Message: "Uneven size of values." occurs and the selection is not being propagated to the other views 
5. Select a range in the ParallelCoordinates View => Same message as in step 4. is shown

For the right views:
2. First select an item in the right active plot view (MatrixPlotView) with a right mouse click (no drag) => Does not work; I have to click an drag 
3. Select a line in the SpreadSheetView => Should work; the selection is propagated over all views (on the same side) 
4. Now repeat step 2. => Should word 
5. Select a range in the ParallelCoordinates View => Should work

Hope that someone could reproduce this.

Cheers,
Stephan

Oops, sorry, I should I read the email properly. Any reason why you're
closing the stdout stream? ParaView captures the streams and replaces
them with custom ones.

Argh! Looks like FFMPEG changed their API one more time! Alas, don't
think I have the resources to get this fixed right now. What version
of ffmpeg is this, in any case?

It seems, 9.3. If the first issue will be solved, I will try to help
with this one.

No special reason, just a habit from a c++-world. Thanks for clarify.

Message-ID: <CAGBgCJGwgai7zYAC_EN_g5Vi05im12XsH2hcY-BOZynYYmZ31w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi -

I want to link points on a scatter scatter plot with a  mesh plot.  I have
run an eigenvalue calculation and I have  the following data

X-axis (Eigenvalue Number)  Y-Axis(Eigenvalue)

I want to make a scatter plot such that, when one clicks on an eigenvalue
in the scatter plot the mode shape is plotted on an adjacent plot. Is this
possible? If so, can someone point me to an example.


Sorry, if this is a FAQ.  The list archives are not searchable so, I could
not search for this topic.

I am not sure I follow, which font size are you referring to? On the
contours panel? Can you attach a screenshot to make things clearer,
please? Thanks.

Anton,

You'll need to ensure the writer continues to work with older
versions, however. You may need to enclose those in #if.#endif blocks

Subject: [Paraview] Contour filter isosurface value and coloring in Catalyst
Message-ID: <C7ACF6F2C9304A4C81EAC2E2C96B5E165F1F1D15@EXMB01.drc.com>

Hello,

Is it possible to set the Isosurface value of the Contour filter to a variable? I want the contour to always be say 10% above the global minimum of a variable, lets call it X.

My thought would be to use the PythonCalculator (... Expression='global_min(X)', ArrayName='Y', ...) and then set the Contour1=Contour(... Isosurfaces[1.10*Y] ... ), but the Catalyst script doesn't like this.

Also, how can I color the contour according to a variable? The Catalyst script does allow the Contour.ColorAttributeType or Contour.ColorArrayName as Attributes.

Right now, I have a script which generates a contour, but I have to fix the scalar value and then color it once I open the .pvtp file. Ideally, this would be done inside the script.

Thanks
Lucas

One way to color each of the glyphs differently is by coloring with a
scalar array. Any point-data arrays present before the glyph filter
was applied are copied over to the individual glyphs by the glyph
filter. You can then color the glyphs using any of the point data
arrays passed through.

You are correct, this would color the glyphs differently, but the user stated he/she wanted to change the colors individually, such as different color depending on which type of fault (or no fault) caused the earthquake.  What my user is asking for is to change the colors after the data is read in, what you are suggesting is coloring by data that is read in.

Do I understand correctly, and is there a way to change one glyph at a time, manually?

Thanks,

Alan

No, there's no such way. If you can somehow come up with a data-array
that can encode some information endemic to the data itself, then that
can be used to color the glyphs e.g. if the type of fault is provided
as a point-array in the input dataset. You can control what color is
shown corresponding to which value e.g. 0 is read, 1 is blue etc. We
don't have way of manually specifying colors or scalar values for the
glyps or points in the dataset.

In Catalyst, it might be possible to extract the final result from the 
PythonCalculator as a simple variable.  I would think it would allow 
that.  I'm wondering if maybe Y is bound as some sort of VTK object 
rather than a simple Python variable.  I know when you're doing 
traditional Python scripting with ParaView, on a client, the results 
from a filter are actually encapsulated in a proxy, and you have to 
explicitly request the results be sent from the server to the client. 
This is to keep you from inadvertently initiating the transfer of some 
huge array from the server to the client.  In this case, the "array" is 
a single value from the Python Calculator.  If you can figure that part 
out, it would be the easiest way to do it.

If not, another way would be to use a Programmable Filter inside your 
Catalyst script.  The Programmable Filter would implement a 
PythonCalculator to get the min, then a Contour filter with the result 
from the PythonCalculator as the threshold input.

I *think* that the _X, _Y, _Z notation is something that the Calculator 
does as a convenience.  I think in the Python calculator, you might have 
to access the components as an array index or use GetComponent() or 
something like that.  I don't see any documentation on the Python 
Calculator that help with that sort of thing, so you might have to 
experiment with it.

Subject: [Paraview] Attempting to run Catalyst CFullExample
Message-ID: <519FFE2A.3090602@indiana.edu>

Hello,

I'm in the process of attempting to learn how to use the Catalyst
feature of ParaView, and I have a problem.

I found the sample code on github:
	- https://github.com/acbauer/CatalystExampleCode

and I began by compiling the "CFullExample" application.

There is some weirdness when trying to compile the application
as a non-Catalyst simulation, but since I'm trying to learn
Catalyst, that's just an aside to the code maintainers.

So I have the application (FEDriver) compiled, and there is
a sample python script.  I ran ParaView (same version as I
used when compiling FEDriver -- a git clone from April),
and I start the Catalyst connection:
	-> Tools -> Connect to Catalyst

(which I had to find by poking around, the SC'12 Catalyst
tutorial doesn't seem to mention this -- or not that I noticed.
An aside to the code documenters.)

So I followed the instructions in the python script, and
with ParaView accepting Catalyst connections on port 22222,
this is what happens:
	% ./FEDriver SampleScripts/feslicescript.py
	Segmentation fault (core dumped)

Actually, that happens regardless of whether ParaView is running
or not, but it only happens when I give the python script as an
argument -- w/o the script, it runs for a moment and then returns
to the prompt.

So what am I missing?

	Thanks,
	Bill

The data arrays in Python calculator are numpy arrays so simply do
something like follows (barring any typos):

    sqrt( pow(ImageData[:,0], 2), pow(ImageData[:,1], 2) )

Hi Bill,

The Catalyst C and C++ examples all require the python script as an argument at run time. The Fortran example requires that the script be in the same directory. So when you aren't giving the script as an argument, the code is running but doesn't have any information about what to co-process, and it exits doing nothing.

As for the seg fault, my guess is that the ParaView versions of the python script and the one against which you are compiling are different. I know they are different on mine and while I don't get a seg fault, I get some errors about the VTK class structures.

I would recommend also checking out the latest versions of the examples. Andy has done a lot of work on them recently, so if they are even a few weeks old, they might not work as expected. Also, you could just export a new script with the PV version built on your system.

I hope this points you in the right direction.

Lucas Pettey

Message-ID: <CAFB7znHrgjejo4S_WZn1YMSPKE_2Gi=J4V+JWDKChSuWazVoJg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Paraview users,

I am trying to plot contours/isosurface for atomistic dump data from lammps.
The dump file contains x y z coordinate values along with a equivalent
stress acting on each atom in simple lammps dump file format (three coloums
for coord and one for stress). How can i plot the contours or iso-surfaces
of stress?

Thanking you
Naveen

I did provide the script as an argument (following the instructions
at the top of the python script).

I'm not quite sure what you mean by "ParaView versions of the python
script".  I do know that when I compiled the simulation with the
Catalyst code, I am pointing to the same version of ParaView that
I'm running.  I don't know how that correlates to python versions.

Well, thought I was downloading his latest examples by grabbing
them directly from his github page.  Is there somewhere else to
look for them?  Most of the files are dated May 13, 2013.

> I hope this points you in the right direction.

Not yet, but if you could explain what you mean by the ParaView
python version, that might shed some light.  I know I'm using the
same version of ParaView.

Hi Utkarsh,

FFMPEG works OK, but there are some difficulties with ogv-format:

====
ERROR: In /tmp/buildd/paraview-4.0.0~rc1/ParaViewCore/ServerManager/Default/vtkSMAnimationSceneImageWriter.cxx,
line 374
pqAnimationSceneImageWriter (0x76db3c0): Unknown extension .ogv
====

Does it mean, that VTK_HAS_OGGTHEORA_SUPPORT is not set to true?

Thanks.

Anton

Sorry for spamming. Attached patch should fix the both libav 54 (there
was a typo
in a previous commit) and OGG-theora extension issues.

Hello,

I am exporting an image using pvbatch which has a cube boundary. When I
visualize it using the GUI, all the edges of the box are showing clearly.
But when I export the image with pvbatch some of the edges are hidden (as
shown in the attached figure).

Any ideas why is this happening?

Hi Bill,

>I did provide the script as an argument (following the instructions
>at the top of the python script).

I just wanted to explain why the program runs for a moment and then returns the prompt if you did not provide the script as an argument like you described in your first email. Providing the script as an argument is the correct way to execute the program. Since you didn't get any errors running the program without the script, the C portion of the program is OK.

>I'm not quite sure what you mean by "ParaView versions of the python
>script".

What I mean is that the version of ParaView which generated the script must be the same as the version of ParaView that you are running and using in your compiler. I think Andy was using the latest git version of ParaView in generating his scripts. So, if his examples are dated May 13, a version of ParaView around that date would be better to use. Yours is a clone in April and a lot of work was being done around then for Catalyst. I have been working on Fortran versions and I know I had to download and rebuild ParaView quite frequently.

I do know the latest git clone does not work with those scripts because the repository has been updated to 4.0, as that is what I have and I tried it.

I would first try to export a script from your version of ParaView. Make sure the CoProcessing plugin is loaded and then you should be able to export the state. You will need to modify the code to write the data to an output file and then open that in ParaView and create a pipeline that you want the CoProcessor to generate. You can then export the state through the plugin. This will generate a python script that you can use in place of the sample provided.

If that doesn't work, then you may might to rebuild to the latest ParaView and try exporting a script from that version. It is critical that the ParaView version used to generate the script is the same as the ParaView version used to compile the program. 

Andy will probably have some good suggestions as he is the primary Catalyst developer. He may even update those examples to ParaView 4.0 soon. 

Also, these are all parallel examples so make sure you are using the correct mpiexec syntax. I know that was something I didn't realize the first time I tried these examples.

Hope this clarifies some thing,

Lucas

I did provide the script as an argument (following the instructions
at the top of the python script).

I'm not quite sure what you mean by "ParaView versions of the python
script".  I do know that when I compiled the simulation with the
Catalyst code, I am pointing to the same version of ParaView that
I'm running.  I don't know how that correlates to python versions.

Well, thought I was downloading his latest examples by grabbing
them directly from his github page.  Is there somewhere else to
look for them?  Most of the files are dated May 13, 2013.

> I hope this points you in the right direction.

Not yet, but if you could explain what you mean by the ParaView
python version, that might shed some light.  I know I'm using the
same version of ParaView.

Message-ID: <CA+0nUO9Y+gJEFdskA6UaefLqqeifOY9TrfOFjOD387D5prZqRg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am a new user of Paraview and I want to ask a simple question about the
selection. I have import my model and I want to select graphically some
cells that are not close to each other. I am using the "Select Cells
Through"  button and I select the first cell then when I select the the
second cell, the first cell deselected automatically. Is there any way to
add or subtract cells to an existing selection using the graphic  interface?

Thank you in advance

Hi Marios,

I'm not sure how to add more cells in the one "*Select Cells Through*"
option - One solution could be to select your first cell with *Select Cells
Through*, then apply the "*Extract Selection*" filter. Re-select the
original data set in the pipeline browser by clicking the eye, then repeat
this for each other cell you want. At the end you can select each extracted
selection in the pipeline browser (using shift+click) and then apply
the *"Append
Datasets"* filter. It seems you can then apply filters to this set that
apply to all your extracted data.

Kind Regards,
Tim

Anton,

I am not sure I follow your changes to
vtkSMAnimationSceneImageWriter.cxx. VTK_HAS_OGGTHEORA_SUPPORT is
defined in vtkIOMovieConfigure.h is vtkIOMovie module was built with
OGGTheora support. The changes may have gone in after RC1, so maybe
you have older source files?

Although you did ask for Select Cells Through (which creates a frustrum for the selection), you can also do Select Cells On (Selects visible cells, on the surface).  Then, using <CTRL>-<CLICK>, you will append the new selections to the old ones.  This does not work for Select Cells Through.

I want to thank you both of you for your answers. It will be nice if in the
next versions of paraview the ctrl feature works for the Select Cells
Through choice.

I also noticed that many of the new lut's that were present (3.14?) were 
removed. I want to complain about it since a number of useful luts were 
removed (it was not just the duplicates). conspicuously missing are 
light to dark luts. For eg luts used to make the following images are 
missing, 
<http://www.hpcvis.com/vis/images/kh-2d-new/paper-figs/bin-287-supl.png>these 
illustrate that the removed luts are useful ones. Those aren't the only 
useful luts that were removed. Any chance the non-duplicated luts could 
be reinstated? Is it because the LUT widget doesn't handle dense series 
of colors gracefully? If so perhaps it would be worth while to fix the 
color scale editor so it can handle dense luts?

Burlen,
I see the very nice simulations that you have done below, but I don't see any names of LUT's that were deleted. Could you tell me a few of the LUT's that were deleted?

Thanks,

Hi Alan,

I was hoping that the person who deleted them would have the specifics 
;-). I'm pasting a screen shot of the original list. from that list:

some of the ones that I liked:
Eos_*, Hue_Sat_*, waves,

light to dark luts:
many/most/all have been removed, those are very useful, and non-trivial 
to recover in some cases. For example take BuGn in pv git master, how 
would you flip that?

others that look appealing to me:
Blue-Red, Rainbow-Black, Rainbow-White, Purple-Red-Stripes, Std_Gamma-II

aside from duplicates, is there a downside to keeping all of them? It's 
really hard to say which ones are going to work well until you're 
actually interacting with the data...

Message-ID: <CAL_eiiS55E=G8ospqqY-iEKE-=pS1p1+e5arFxtxEA1WRV_TQA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I have created a macro using the "start/stop trace" feature of PV GUI. I am
trying to create a movie with two animations side by side, each with a
different camera movement. This macro gives me what I want when I run it
with PV GUI but when I run it using pvbatch on command line, it only gives
me as ouput the png files for one view.

What can I do? I have attached the macro with this email.

Thanks

Subject: [Paraview] Creating macro for Interpolate-camera-locations camera
	movement
Message-ID: <CAL_eiiSVh55yOd12ay6jg7zGYZGWgFzkdUua5obRfA9Xbe48Cw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am trying to create a macro using PV GUI for creating a movie using the
Interpolate-camera-locations feature of the "camera" option in "Animation
View". But even when I am doing the simplest action i.e. just specifying
two times (T1=12 and T2=60) and two positions, between which I want PV to
interpolate the solution, the macro being generated by "start/end trace"
feature of the GUI has no indication of the times specified.

The macro generated is attached with this email.

I am not understanding how can I edit this macro if I want to play around
with the camera angles a bit. Any suggesting readings or inputs?

Thank you

Hi!

I've noticed that version for 64bit linux built with libc 2.15 has annoying 
delays when zooming data. There is no such delay in version built with libc 
2.3.6. I'm using debian testing amd64 with libc (eglibc) 2.17. Am I alone with 
this problem?

Subject: [Paraview] Superbuild installation directory
Message-ID: <345817C8A61EA841AAE0120EC1514D9547E3EDA7@umechphd.easf.csd.disa.mil>

I want to set the installation directory using the Superbuild script, but it seems to be ignoring the value

My cmake command looks like:

cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/people/angel/pv-test/3.98.1_osmesa \
-Ddownload_location=`pwd`/../Downloads \
-DENABLE_boost=ON \
-DENABLE_cgns=ON \
-DENABLE_ffmpeg=ON \
-DENABLE_hdf5=ON \
-DENABLE_matplotlib=ON \
-DENABLE_osmesa=ON \
-DENABLE_mesa=OFF \
-DENABLE_mpi=ON \
-DENABLE_numpy=ON \
-DENABLE_paraview=ON \
-DENABLE_python=ON \
-DENABLE_qt=OFF \
-DENABLE_silo=ON \
-DENABLE_szip=ON \
-DGIT_EXECUTABLE=/usr/cta/CSE.20130220/Release/git-1.6.5.2/bin/git \
-DUSE_SYSTEM_mpi=ON ../Source


When I run "make install" it get a clean build, but the installation directory is in Build/install  rather than /usr/people/angel/pv-test/3.98.1_osmesa.    If I drop into the Build/paraview directory and rerun cmake to change the installation directory and then rerun "make install", I get the proper installation.       Am I setting the wrong variable when I run the cmake command?    This is the correct variable as described in the wiki page at http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Superbuild

I'm seeing this with 3.98.1 and 4.0.0rc2

Rick,

There is always going to be a BUILD/install. This is where all the
internal packages ParaViewSuperbuild builds are temporarily installed.
Something is resetting the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX. I cannot find any
code in ParaViewSuperbuild itself that does that. Try this instead:
-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=... (note the :PATH). Does that help?

What cmake version are you using?

Adding :PATH seems to be the right fix.  Thanks

Is there something hard-coded for 4.0 in the Superbuild sources.  I'm building 3.98.1 and but I'm seeing this error:


CMake Error at cmake_install.cmake:48 (FILE):
  file INSTALL cannot find
  "/usr/people/angel/PV/Build/install/lib/paraview-4.0".

Yes, the Superbuild's git-master is now building 4.0.0 from
git-master. Use the revision: c25879eed78b3ff7e4a457da8cdd14a5752792f8
for 3.98.1. I will push a tag labelled v3.98.1 for the same (I'm
having permission issues, but will get that addressed soon).

Gena,

This maybe a bug in the way we're building the binaries on that
machine. It ends up packaging the Mesa libraries and hence the issue.
I am wondering if it's even worth providing these binaries (with the
glibnc-2.15). If there's no strong need, I think I'll purge them for
now and just leave the libc-2.3.6 binaries as with the previous
releases.

Okay.

Make sense.

Okay, yesterday I downloaded and compiled a git clone (which calls itself
4.0.0 RC-2.

That would be good if there were a step-by-step tutorial that goes with the
examples, but I know that time (especially with the 4.0 release 
preparations)
is tight.  But w/o step-by-step, or at least a picture of what the pipeline
is supposed to look like, I'm not ready to be able to figure out how
to build the pipeline to match the example code.

So I'm hoping that the 4.0.0 RC-2 version will work with his examples.

It looks like the examples on his github page haven't changed since I last
got them, so that's a good sign that things have stabilized:
	- https://github.com/acbauer/CatalystExampleCode

Hmmm, okay, so I'm not actually running in parallel, so that could also
be my problem.  But I can report that with the current version of ParaView,
things now break in a different way -- no segfault, but I get some
python errors:
	% ./FEDriver SampleScripts/feslicescript.py >& output

And now that you mention that this should be done in parallel:
	% mpirun -np 2 ./FEDriver SampleScripts/feslicescript.py >& output

But that gives the same output!

	% head output

Hi Bill,

Good news! You now get the same error that I do when you try to run the examples scripts. This means that everything is installed correctly. Notice that the trace back error is related to 'vtkCPPythonHelper' in the sample script. This would indicate that the script you are using is incompatible with ParaView 4.0.

With ParaView 4.0, you should get the same results (or in this case error) in serial and parallel. It seems that Catalyst based on ParaView 4.0 is better at determining whether or not to use parallel functions. There is probably a more detailed explanation, but from my observations it is "smarter".

To get this example working with 4.0, we need a sample pipeline from which we can export the state. If you look in FEDataStructures.c, you will see what the code is doing.
The code creates a 3D CoRectilinear grid in the "grid" struc. A second struc called "Attributes" assigns Velocities as point data and Pressure as cell data. As written, the velocity varies in time and the y direction only, while pressure is constant at zero.

A good exercise is to write the data to a file using your favorite method to get it into ParaView. For small data like this, I like to run it on a single processor and use the RAW (binary) data format. I would recommend just working with the velocity since it is point based and is the only variable doing anything interesting. Once you have done that, create whatever filter you like in the pipeline. The example script contains a Slice filter. If you want to be able to manipulate the data after co-processing, make sure you attach a writer to the end of the pipeline. If you don't have a writer, you can ask ParaView to output images or set up live visualization. This is done through the Co-Processing -> Export State option.

If you don't want to go through all of this, you have 2 options. The first is to wait until Andy updates the examples to work with ParaView 4.0. The second would be to checkout the version from 5-14: http://paraview.org/gitweb?p=ParaView.git;a=commit;h=6720c3dc175bea3e0098c27695111137d174d989. I THINK this version aligned Catalyst with the VTK changes and was a working version. I did a lot of rebuilding around this time, so I can't be sure. I have been working with Catalyst and Fortran and use my own scripts exclusively.

This is a learning process, so if you are learning, you are marching towards the finish line. The code was in flux for a while, but seems to be stable now. I hope this helps you continue to move forward.

Lucas

Okay.

Make sense.

Okay, yesterday I downloaded and compiled a git clone (which calls itself
4.0.0 RC-2.

That would be good if there were a step-by-step tutorial that goes with the
examples, but I know that time (especially with the 4.0 release
preparations)
is tight.  But w/o step-by-step, or at least a picture of what the pipeline
is supposed to look like, I'm not ready to be able to figure out how
to build the pipeline to match the example code.

So I'm hoping that the 4.0.0 RC-2 version will work with his examples.

It looks like the examples on his github page haven't changed since I last
got them, so that's a good sign that things have stabilized:
        - https://github.com/acbauer/CatalystExampleCode

Hmmm, okay, so I'm not actually running in parallel, so that could also
be my problem.  But I can report that with the current version of ParaView,
things now break in a different way -- no segfault, but I get some
python errors:
        % ./FEDriver SampleScripts/feslicescript.py >& output

And now that you mention that this should be done in parallel:
        % mpirun -np 2 ./FEDriver SampleScripts/feslicescript.py >& output

But that gives the same output!

        % head output
        Traceback (most recent call last):
          File "<string>", line 2, in <module>
          File "SampleScripts/feslicescript.py", line 12, in <module>
            exec
vtkPVPythonCatalystPython.vtkCPPythonHelper.GetPythonHelperScript()
        AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'vtkCPPythonHelper'
        Traceback (most recent call last):
          File "<string>", line 2, in <module>
        NameError: name 'feslicescript' is not defined
        Traceback (most recent call last):
          File "<string>", line 2, in <module>
        NameError: name 'feslicescript' is not defined

And here's the beginning of that Python script:
        % head -15 SampleScripts/feslicescript.py
        # sample Python script for CxxFullExample. Run with:
        # <FEDriver path>/FEDriver <path to this script>/feslicescript.py

Hi Bill & Lucas,

I was on vacation the last several days and am now finally catching up.

Thanks for the info on the examples not working with the 4.0 release
candidates. I haven't tested them in a while so it's possible that
something is out of sync. As Lucas mentioned, Catalyst had quite a bit of
changes recently but it should have calmed down by now. I'll try and get
the examples updated as well in the next couple of days. Once ParaView 4.0
comes out I'll tag the examples as well and hopefully in the not too
distant future put up a dashboard with the examples running against
ParaView master to help keep things in sync.

I think Lucas answered your questions well but let us know if there's still
something that isn't quite clear.

Regards,
Andy

Subject: [Paraview] animation problem with different view points
Message-ID: <CAHrmR1U_nBNeinE1FSEVBGB_gfb6pW=ahNeme3k_q1xEfqYaGw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all:

      I have an animation problem to be solved.  It is like this:

I have a vtk mesh sequence to show an deformable mesh in ten vtk file.
It shows the deformation in one motion cycle.
I can load the ten file and display the deformation and make an
animation of the motion
 at a fixed view point.

However I want to know how to make an animation of the motion seeing
from different view points
(eg. 3 view points).  Here is what I am trying to record:

in viewpoint1,
the 10 mesh files show the deformation in one cycle
in viewpoint2,
the 10 mesh files show the deformation in one cycle
in viewpoint3,
the 10 mesh files show the deformation in on cycle.

I have tried with the current time control method in the animation view.
however, I have not find a solution for this.  The camera will
automatically interpolation
in each motion cycle, instead of fixing at a view point.

Thank you very much for any idea on this problem.

regards,
Alex

Great.

Yes, I think once I see a working example and the steps needed to get
there I should be off to the races.  I haven't decided yet whether I'll
go back and compile the 05/14/13 version of ParaView, or perhaps wait
until you've had a chance to update the examples for the upcoming
release.

I've got a book chapter due, so I may just wait until I get that done
and see where things are.

	Thanks again for your help,

Look at the attached sample script. You basically need to set the
ViewSize and ViewPosition properties for all the views correctly to
lay the views out as desired.

There are ways to do this, but it can be trick. Easiest would be to
save out 3 separate animations as *.png and then combine them into a
single movie using ffmpeg or other image-to-movie tools.

Hi,

Is it intended that the Camera Undo button has been removed from the
view toolbar? I know the Edit - Camera Undo menu is still there but
the button was convenient.

Thanks for the tips. I started working on http-proxy, but there seems to be
an issue with websocket proxying. On the Chrome javascript console we get
error code 400 on paraview.start()

WebSocket connection to 'ws://localhost:8080/ws' failed: Unexpected
response code: 400

even though everything runs fine on the proxy server. Seems similar to this
stackoverflow question

Hello,

I figured out my problem. I declared the "ViewSize" and the "ViewPosition" at the wrong place. I had to declare them right after "createRenderView()" and it is working fine now.

Thank you again

That is intentional. When the moving of selection buttons to the
view-toolbar, there are now too many buttons. It isn't clear how often
these camera undo-buttons were used. If there's a strong sentiment one
way or the other, we can revisit this.

So not so many users were using the button - thanks for the clarification.

Message-ID: <C86024F0-7F10-43E1-A2D5-D893BC94A8B4@aia.rwth-aachen.de>

Hi,

I installed ParaView 4.0.0-RC2 on my Macbook by compiling it from source. When I start ParaView from command line, it always disappears behind the active window. Does anyone know how to fix this, so that when ParaView is started, it will be the application at the very front of my screen? Please note that is not started "hidden" (i.e. only in the dock), but the window actually uses the full screen  - it's just not visible and you have to use Cmd-Tab to get to it.

Regards,

Michael

FYI: I just updated the Catalyst examples (commit SHA
f041507af5f6f010c9f8a2de8b3014ae19a2394b) to work with ParaView as of
today's gatekeeper review (commit SHA
a3508bd9e0164c85968d6cde64e2275cd57aab3c).

If you get issues, let me know.

Hello Utkarsh,

I managed to get two frames but I am still seeing some issues. I have the
Python macro and the movie output at this link:
http://arrow.utias.utoronto.ca/~jhapk/

1) I am not able to show the Annotation Time only in one frame.
2) In the left frame the Annotation Time is not being shown properly. It is
always showing two values at the same location.
3) The orientation axis of one frame is being shown in both frames. Why?
How can I fix this?
4) In some movie frames (for example movie.0002.png) the left side has some
lines of the boxes missing. Why is this happening? This does not happen
when I export the movie using GUI. My geometry is a simple cube.

Any suggestions about the possible solutions of these problems?
Thank you

Hi Michael,

That's a standard behavior of MacOSX.  If you start the application with
"open bin/paraview.app" then the window will appear on top.

Hi all,

I have found the cause of this and have a fix, but it may not make it into the 4.0 release.

I'm using that revision now, but I get an error that zlib-1.2.7 doesn't 
exist.  I guess zlib pulls their previous versions from the default 
download location.  Should the v3.98.1 tag be updated to to 1.2.8 or 
should we use a different mirror?

Subject: [Paraview] auto accept on IntVectorProperty
Message-ID: <b4e16c341ff8f969724d5c7b5cc5b3d0.squirrel@webmail.pitt.edu>

Hi,

I have a plugin filter that uses an IntVectorProperty.
(XML below, adapted from a paraview help posting).
I would like auto accept to work on this so the user
can just slide the slider and see changes but when
I put auto accept on the pipeline is not updated.
Is there a way for IntVectorProperty widgets to auto accept ?

thanks
Kate

		information_only="1"
		number_of_elements="2"
		default_values="1 100">
	 <SimpleIntInformationHelper />
	</IntVectorProperty>


	<IntVectorProperty

I've added a new tag "v3.98.1-1" that fixes the URLs to point to the
ones on paraview.org.

Hi Pat,

If I do that, I get an error "The application cannot be opened because its executable is missing.". When I have a look at the Info.plist file, it contains the lines

<key>CFBundleExecutable</key>
<string>paraview</string>

and <builddir>/bin/paraview.app/Contents/MacOS has a "paraview" executable. Any idea what the reason could be?

Michael

P.S.: As I already noted on "Paraview-developers] Problems with protobuf when loading self-compiled plugin on OS X", I cannot use "make install" to create a working app bundle in the /Applications directory. If I use "make install", I *am* able to start ParaView using the "open" command, but then I buy this convenience with losing the ability to use my own plugins. I don't know if this makes a difference or not - as far as I understand from the ParaView build wiki, I should be able to use ParaView without using "make install"

Does anyone know how to fix this, so that when ParaView is started, it will be the application at the very front of my screen? Please note that is not started "hidden" (i.e. only in the dock), but the window actually uses the full screen  - it's just not visible and you have to use Cmd-Tab to get to it.

UNRESTRICTED | ILLIMIT?

 

Hello All,

 

I am trying to understand why when I use show with surface with edges I am getting bizarre results.  I have used a program called cubit to create an exodus file of my mesh on my local machine with quad8 (quadratic) elements.  To explain the behaviour, I have created a simple case called junk. When I open this exodus file (without results) into Paraview  on my local machine I obtain the mesh shown in the attached image JunkParaviewLocal.jpg.  

 

Now, I run my simulations remotely to another computer used by someone else because it is faster than the computer I currently use locally.  This is done through linux and ssh. If I secure copy the same exodus file to the remote machine and open it in Paraview on the remote machine I obtain the mesh shown in ParaviewJunkRemote.jpg, which is obviously the incorrect representation of the mesh.  I've run the simulation assuming the triangulation was just a graphics issue but the results were based upon the triangular mesh which is incorrect.

 

Why does paraview triangulize the mesh when running remotely?  I ask this because if I run the simulation using the mesh from this exodus file, I obtain results based on the triangular mesh rather than the quadrilateral mesh I designed, and this leads to incorrect results.

 

I thought it may be an issue with the copying of the file so I went to the remote machine with the exodus file on a usb key and copied the file to the hard drive.  I tried opening the file locally on the remote machine and when I click surface with edges, Paraview immediately exits with a seg fault. 

 

Why would paraview exit with a seg fault when clicking surface with edges, when the exodus file opens fine on my local machine?  In addition other exodus files open perfectly fine in Paraview on the remote machine indicating to me there is nothing wrong with the installation of Paraview either.

 

Again this seems like unusual behaviour and I need to be able to run my simulations on the remote computer on the correct mesh.  I do not experience this behaviour using first order quad4 elements.

 

If anyone has any ideas on why this behaviour is observed and how to correct it would be greatly appreciated.

 

Thank you,

 

Kyle Gamble

My machines that build ParaView for the dashboard seem to be taking an
extremely long time in CMake generate step.

This started this week but I can't find evidence of the builds on the
dashboard before then.

Does anybody know what's going on?

The CMake configure/generation time has indeed grown long since the
modularization changes. We did some preliminary investigation and
couldn't find any smoking guns, unfortunately.

4 hours for this Mesa DRI build :

http://open.cdash.org/buildSummary.php?buildid=2922351

3 hours for this OSMesa build :

http://open.cdash.org/buildSummary.php?buildid=2922048

While looking at a few other builds I saw only times of a few minutes.

I'll experiment with this...

And ... paraview is almost useless in visual studio (2012) because projects rebuild constantly when they don't need to. 

Some dependency seems to have been introduced which causes problems.
Just FYI. I can't find a solution (I've really tried), but am working around it as best I can.

The CMake configure/generation time has indeed grown long since the modularization changes. We did some preliminary investigation and couldn't find any smoking guns, unfortunately.

I think what I'm seeing is specific to nightly cmake and ParaView.

If I configure ParaView with system CMake version 2.8.9 cmake takes just
1m24.100s. However nightly cmake takes forever.

Configuring VTK with system cmake takes just 0m46.588s versus 2m52.422s
for nightly cmake.

Oh, that's something totally weird and unexpected. Maybe the disk is
dying or something? I was talking of a delay of a few minutes not
hours.

I don't know what you're referring to and using which version of
ParaView. Is this koher ParaView or modified ParaView? How can I
reproduce this?

I'll track it down. Looks like there's a bug in the annotation text
rendering logic somewhere.

Hmm, no I don't know what would cause that.  By any chance, have you set
the DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable?  If so, try unsetting that.  I
assume the lines you pasted from the Info.plist is just a snippet, and the
file contains more than that, right?

I think the thread has moved past this but to address the suggestion of
disk failure:

the issue began simultaneously on two systems

both systems have mirrored disks which /proc/mdstat says are good

smartd has reported no errors.

That sounds like the kind of behaviour that occurs when a command line application tries to show a GUI.  You see similar with many VTK unit tests.  On OS X, the only supported way to show a GUI (NSWindow, NSView, etc.) is to do so from a .app bundled application.  Is your ParaView build as a .app or just a plain executable?

Cheers,

Hi Kate,

Have you tried using ParaView's auto-apply feature? It can be enabled
in the Edit->Settings dialog.

Thanks,
Kyle

Subject: [Paraview] crash when picking with 'p' for stream tracer : Tag
 mismatch: got 1, expecting 22222
Message-ID: <51A90DF7.60901@lbl.gov>

Hi All,

With git master (first noticed a few days ago, rebased this am) I'm 
hitting crash when attempting to use the stream tracer interactive 
picking a seed.

1) load the data,
2) change to surface rep,
3) add stream tracer filter
4) hit the 'p' key to select a seed -> crash.

I've only been able to reproduce with a real dataset (1024^3 image 
mesh). the small data I've tried from ParaViewData doesn't lead to the 
crash,  However, there's plenty of ram (first encountered using 32 ranks 
4 ranks per node 48g per node on longhorn reduced to 4 ranks 24g  on my 
workstation for debugging). I can share this dataset if it helps to 
debug, or you may have to use a large dataset to trigger.

filed a bug report: http://paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=14107

here's cerr output and a stack

Subject: [Paraview] Help with batch processing and loops
Message-ID: <CALdMxnxmzx0UHewgxeOJoy6Bo7sw76qEzTdvsi2wK161S=PxRw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am switching to using Paraview from Tecplot and I need to do the
following thing: I have a series of XDMF files that I need to read into
Paraview one by one, apply some filters and export an image. In Tecplot I
would write a macro, inside the macro there was a loop that changed the
name of the file, then read the filename and in a style that applied all
the filters and finally exported an image. I would run the macro in batch
mode.

How can I do sth similar in Paraview? I have no experience with python.

Kind regards,

Nikos
