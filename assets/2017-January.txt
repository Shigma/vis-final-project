Subject: [Paraview] difference in the output of co-processing
Message-ID: <28223582-6312-69d8-340f-2d9bcddddb9e@be.itu.edu.tr>

Hi,

I am trying to use Paraview co-processing component to create
visualization from custom model. The problem is that the color bars are
misplaced and also smaller and thinner in the co-processing output (saved
png file) if i compare it with direct visualization from Paraview. I am
attaching sample png files for both case and also Python file that is used
for the co-processing. I just wonder that is it possible to fix it easily?
It might be a bug but i am not sure.

Thanks,
Regards,

--ufuk

Hi Seb,

1. "C:/ParaView-5.2.0-Qt4-OpenGL2-MPI-Windows-64bit/data" works fine. Now
we can see the list of files in the data folder.

However, there seems to be some problem with the ParaviewWeb Application
(or may be with the graphics driver?). Because we cannot render the sample
mesh files (eg: can.ex2) in the visualizer. When we tried to view the files
in the desktop application they are displayed without any problems. A
screenshot of the graphics driver is attached for your reference.

2. Ok.


Cheers & Best Wishes,
Debopam

Subject: [Paraview] How to start the Catalyst example: CxxFullExample

Hi,

The Catalyst examples have been moved to the ParaView source repo. I'd
recommend using the newest version of ParaView as well as Catalyst since
there have been a lot of improvements since PV 4.4.

For the  CxxFullExample, if you've built it with Catalyst enabled you can
run it as you've done as well as pass in Catalyst Python scripts to use
through command line arguments.

Subject: [Paraview] difference in the output of co-processing

Hi Ufuk,

I'm not sure what is causing the difference. I'm guessing not all of the
information for the view is saved in the state. Any chance that you're
using different versions of ParaView for the GUI and Catalyst generated
images? I see that the Python script is specifying that it was generated in
a PV 5.2 release candidate.

If it's the same version of PV then you can test the state mechanism in PV
by saving the state as both a Python script as well as a pvsm file. After
that, try generating the image by loading the pvsm state file and running
the Python state file in the GUI.

Another possibility is that there are some config settings in the GUI that
aren't used in Catalyst. If you don't mind helping narrow down the cause of
the issue we can put in a bug report for this.

Thanks,
Andy

Hi Debopam,

Do you see the orientation axis? Does it move when you rotate the scene?
What happen when you click on "+" and choose the Wavelet? Do you see
something?

I'm wondering if you still run into an invalid path issue due to / or \.

Seb

Oops, I got some logic mixed up when doing that bit. Here's a PR for the
common superbuild to fix this:

Subject: [Paraview] Custom Glyph
Message-ID: <CACXVUXF1ugoxSSvcv+R-1--gotaDVMz+mKXwgvdx14vF-QsW7Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Any links or advice on how to create a custom glyph?

I'd like a sphere divided into 8 equal sized/shaped patches and colored
alternate black and white, to represent the centroid of a point mass. I
have lots of these, so a glyph would be best.

Thanks, Bob

Glyph with Custom source filter can do it. Note that it works in CPU/RAM
instead of in a GPU shader so memory can be an issue for all the replicated
geometry.

To use it, manufacture a mesh that appears the way you want it and save it
in a common mesh format. Load that into the pipeline and hide it, select
the object you want to apply glyphs to and apply the Glyph with Custom
Source filter. Choose the shape you read in as the "Glyph Type" input.

Hi Andy,

Thanks for your reply! Now I can run the CxxFullExample, but I've encountered some more problems about it.

1.The CxxFullExample has a 70x60x44 unstructured grid, and it runs relatively quickly. A truncated sample output of Timer Log is as follows:


RenderView::Update,  0.161069 seconds
PVTrivialProducer::GatherInformation,  0.051133 seconds
vtkSMDataDeliveryManager: Deliver Geome,  0.336371 seconds
    FullRes Data Migration,  0.336246 seconds
Still Render,  0.034509 seconds
RenderView::Update,  0.149692 seconds
PVTrivialProducer::GatherInformation,  0.051577 seconds
vtkSMDataDeliveryManager: Deliver Geome,  0.322268 seconds
    FullRes Data Migration,  0.322144 seconds
Still Render,  0.033618 seconds
RenderView::Update,  0.156578 seconds
PVTrivialProducer::GatherInformation,  0.051578 seconds
vtkSMDataDeliveryManager: Deliver Geome,  0.342933 seconds
    FullRes Data Migration,  0.342809 seconds
Still Render,  0.033976 seconds

However, after I modified the grid to a 700x60x44 one and nothing else were modified, it became fairly slow when running. Also, a truncated sample output of Timer Log:

RenderView::Update,  1.48987 seconds
PVTrivialProducer::GatherInformation,  0.493497 seconds
vtkSMRepresentationProxy::GetRepresente,  2.44198 seconds
vtkSMDataDeliveryManager: Deliver Geome,  0.480933 seconds
    FullRes Data Migration,  0.480786 seconds
Still Render,  0.116726 seconds
    OpenGL Dev Render,  0.020361 seconds
RenderView::Update,  1.51507 seconds
PVTrivialProducer::GatherInformation,  0.493821 seconds
vtkSMRepresentationProxy::GetRepresente,  2.47383 seconds
vtkSMDataDeliveryManager: Deliver Geome,  0.481844 seconds
    FullRes Data Migration,  0.481686 seconds
Still Render,  0.116896 seconds
    OpenGL Dev Render,  0.020697 seconds
RenderView::Update,  1.50415 seconds
PVTrivialProducer::GatherInformation,  0.491896 seconds
vtkSMRepresentationProxy::GetRepresente,  2.44277 seconds
vtkSMDataDeliveryManager: Deliver Geome,  0.474105 seconds
    FullRes Data Migration,  0.473959 seconds
Still Render,  0.114223 seconds
    OpenGL Dev Render,  0.020254 seconds

Comparing the two outputs, I find that the time spent in some processes became about 10  times longer, as the dataset became 10 times larger, but some other processes didn't  take 10 times longer time. The biggest difference is  vtkSMRepresentationProxy::GetRepresente, which takes more than 2.4s per frame in the bigger dataset example while in the smaller dataset example it takes less than 0.01s per frame. I don't know what the program does in the vtkSMRepresentationProxy::GetRepresente method. Actually I only know about Still Render. Could you please give me a brief introduction to these items? And, as Catalyst is designed for in situ visualization of very large dataset, is there any method to make the example run faster?

2.When I create Catelyst Python scripts in the ParaView GUI, I have to enable all of the Live Visualization, Output to Cinema and Output rendering components i.e. views options to get live visualization of the simulation in the PV GUI, but under this setting, it generates lots of pictures, which I don't need. If I don't enable either of Output to Cinema or Output rendering components i.e. views, I could not get the live visualization, and of course no picture is generated. But what's the function of the Live Visualization option?

All of the above are situations in the PV 4.4.0 in the client-server mode. As for PV 5.2, I have some problems in using it in the client-server mode. Hope you can help me. Thank you again!

Hi,


The Catalyst examples have been moved to the ParaView source repo. I'd recommend using the newest version of ParaView as well as Catalyst since there have been a lot of improvements since PV 4.4.


For the  CxxFullExample, if you've built it with Catalyst enabled you can run it as you've done as well as pass in Catalyst Python scripts to use through command line arguments.

Hello everyone,

I'm learning the ParaView Catalyst by starting at the CxxFullExample, which is one of the Catalyst examples from https://github.com/Kitware/ParaViewCatalystExampleCode-MOVED-. I have compiled and built it and got the CxxFullExample executable. It is said that it's a full example of a simulation code interfacing with Catalyst, but I don't know how to execute it. I typed "./CxxFullExample" in the command line under the build directory of the example and nothing happened. I read the Chapter 2 of the Catalyst User's Guide and found what's  mainly discussed is about creating ParaView Catalyst scripts in ParaView. It is said that to create ParaView Catalyst scripts in ParaView, I must have a representative dataset, and the Appendix 7.1.2 of the guide has a script that can be used to create the dataset. I managed to get lots of files named "filename_x_x.vtu" and "filename_x.pvtu"(x is a number) by typing "./CxxFullExample ./pvpython python.py"(python.py i s the script from the appendix 7.1.2 of the user's guide) in the command line under the bin directory of ParaView 4.4.0. Then I followed the section 2.2 of the user's guide with one of the file I generated above, only to get another script. Actually, what I want is a condition shown at www.kitware.com/blog/home/post/722, but after read the section 2.3 of the user's guide, I'm still unable to implement it. How should I organize the Catalyst enabled simulation and ParaView? Can it work in the client-server mode? Can I get it to work without much knowledge of Python? Maybe I'm on the wrong way of learning Catalyst, if so, you can ignore my questions and just tell me the right way. Thanks a lot!

Hi Andy,

No, i am using same PV installation in both case under same server.

As you suggested, i saved the state in Python format and run under GUI 
(Tools > Python Shell > Run Script). It basically opens a new RenderView 
and places the color bars like in co-processing output (misplaced, 
thinner and smaller) and does not show anything about the rest of the 
visualization. It just have color bars but i could see the correct 
pipeline in the pipeline browser. It is little bit weird. If i am doing 
something wrong, please let me know.

Also, i did not modify the default config settings of the GUI and if you 
want me to check any specific option, please let me know.

Thank for your help,
Regards,

--ufuk

Thanks David,

I did try that first and was unable to select the "Glyph Type" and gave up.
Luckily your post encouraged me to RTM where it states that vtkPolyData
should be used for the glyph. A quick extract surface filter fixed that, so
thanks very much for your help.

Subject: [Paraview] Still Render in PV5.2.0 takes longer time than in PV4.4.0
Message-ID: <3ce5a9.6f5d.15964043482.Coremail.yzhzhang@ipe.ac.cn>



Hi,

I'm using PV 5.2.0 and PV 4.4.0 in the standalone mode rendering a dataset, which contains 10M random points and is just for test. I found after I turned off  the display list as the PV User's Guide told me, the Still Render process in PV5.2.0 takes longer time than in PV4.4.0.

First, there is a NVIDIA GeForce GT 730 GPU in my computer, so I don't use mesa. When rendering with the display list on as default, PV 5.2.0 is faster than 4.4.0, which is reasonable. A truncated sample output of Timer Log of PV 5.2.0 is as follows:

RenderView::Update,  2.28551 seconds
    vtkPVView::Update,  2.28539 seconds
        Execute vtkFileSeriesReader id: 5063,  1.98558 seconds
        Execute vtkGeometryRepresentationWithFa,  0.298828 seconds
LegacyVTKFileReader::GatherInformation,  0.300355 seconds
Still Render,  0.43975 seconds
    OpenGL Dev Render,  0.334455 seconds

And the counterpart in PV 4.4.0 is:

RenderView::Update,  2.34043 seconds
    vtkPVView::Update,  2.34034 seconds
        Execute vtkFileSeriesReader id: 4734,  1.90546 seconds
        Execute vtkGeometryRepresentationWithFa,  0.43377 seconds
LegacyVTKFileReader::GatherInformation,  0.440593 seconds
Still Render,  0.963793 seconds
    OpenGL Dev Render,  0.806468 seconds

While other processes take similar time, the Still Render process in PV 5.2.0 takes less than half of that in PV 4.4.0.
The PV User's Guide recommends that when dealing with very large data, turning off display list may help. I tried it and found in this situation the Still Render process in PV 5.2.0 takes longer time than in PV 4.4.0.

A truncated sample output of Timer Log of PV 5.2.0 when turning off display list is as follows:

RenderView::Update,  2.23385 seconds
    vtkPVView::Update,  2.23374 seconds
        Execute vtkFileSeriesReader id: 4914,  1.93566 seconds
        Execute vtkGeometryRepresentationWithFa,  0.297103 seconds
LegacyVTKFileReader::GatherInformation,  0.301925 seconds
Still Render,  0.440343 seconds
    OpenGL Dev Render,  0.335149 seconds

And the counterpart in PV 4.4.0 is:

RenderView::Update,  2.4048 seconds
    vtkPVView::Update,  2.4047 seconds
        Execute vtkFileSeriesReader id: 4733,  1.97007 seconds
        Execute vtkGeometryRepresentationWithFa,  0.433521 seconds
LegacyVTKFileReader::GatherInformation,  0.440413 seconds
Still Render,  0.211394 seconds
    OpenGL Dev Render,  0.205734 seconds

While in PV 5.2.0 turning that option off had little effect on the running time, it significantly reduced the Still Render time in PV 4.4.0 and made the time less than half of that in PV 5.2.0.

Could anyone tell me why this happening? Thanks a lot!

-Zhang

Hi Seb,

1. We are able to see the orientation axis and also able to rotate them.
For example, when we click on can.ex2, we see a blank black screen. Then
after we hide the left panel, we are able to see the orientation axis and
also rotate them.

2. When we select the Wavelet we were able to view it properly, and was
also able to rotate the scene.

3. We tried with both / and \\ but there is no change. The command we are
using to launch paraview is as below:

a: .\bin\pvpython.exe
"C:\\ParaView-5.2.0-Qt4-OpenGL2-MPI-Windows-64bit\\share\\paraview-5.2\\web\\visualizer\\server\\pvw-visualizer.py"
--content
"C:\\ParaView-5.2.0-Qt4-OpenGL2-MPI-Windows-64bit\\share\\paraview-5.2\\web\\visualizer\\www"
--data "C:\\ParaView-5.2.0-Qt4-OpenGL2-MPI-Windows-64bit\\data" --port 8080

b: .\bin\pvpython.exe
"C:/ParaView-5.2.0-Qt4-OpenGL2-MPI-Windows-64bit/share/paraview-5.2/web/visualizer/server/pvw-visualizer.py"
--content
"C:/ParaView-5.2.0-Qt4-OpenGL2-MPI-Windows-64bit/share/paraview-5.2/web/visualizer/www"
--data "C:/ParaView-5.2.0-Qt4-OpenGL2-MPI-Windows-64bit/data" --port 8080

Is this with OpenGL1 or 2 back end? If you are using Kitware's binaries 4.4
will be OpenGL1 and 5.2 will be OpenGL2. If you built from source or got it
from a distro then it might be otherwise.

A way to tell which type of build you're using is to loo at the title
bar. For OpenGL1, the title bar says "Legacy Rendering Backend". Such
a suffix is missing for OpenGL2 build.

For the new OpenGL2 backend setting ImmediateModeRendering or
UseDisplayLists or something similar has no impact. Those concepts are part
of the legacy OpenGL API. So you should see no difference in timings with
them turned on or off with the new OpenGL backend.

Subject: [Paraview] slicing a large VTK_POLYHEDRON
Message-ID: <a1cc4dc2-da4f-25d9-0e7e-d9e02b248d85@rtech-engineering.nl>

Hi,

I am using paraview to visualise my data. I generate my data using a 
combination of the 2 following types 
(http://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/vtkCellType_8h_source.html)
VTK_VOXEL 
<http://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/vtkCellType_8h.html#ab1d6fd1f3177b8a2a32bb018807151f8a06a70888292dc4309e42404af594fbb4>= 
11
VTK_POLYHEDRON = 42 I can visualize that data with parview without a 
problem. But, because I ended up having a segfault without any error 
message when slicing (Z=0) the data. I decomposed my data in separate 
files for each VTK_POLYHEDRON in order to investigate the problem.

I found out that only the polyhedrons with the largest size were having 
the problem. The limit is somewhere between the 2 files:
- poly-F1000-2395.vtu : working: 466 points, 928 faces
- poly-F1000-2987.vtu : segfault when slicing: 546 points, 1088 faces

So my guess is that there is a limit for the number of points or the 
number of faces that can have the polyhedron (1024 ?) if I want to be 
able to use the slice function.

My questions are :
1) Is there actually a limitation in Paraview (VTK?) regarding the 
number of faces or the number of the point that the slice function can 
handle for a polyhedron ?
2) If there is this limitation, is there an option to remove it in 
Paraview ? (specific version, compilation option, etc)
3) If there is this limitation, is there any work around that exist so I 
am able to slice my data ? For example a different format ?


I attached the data to be able to back up my statement:

poly-F1000-*.vtu : files describing a polyhedron each:
poly-F1000.pvd : load all those files

Biggest file for which the slicing works (size, name):
34K poly-F1000-2395.vtu

The 8 biggest files triggering the crash when doing a slice: (size, name)
38K poly-F1000-2987.vtu
39K poly-F1000-2983.vtu
39K poly-F1000-2935.vtu
39K poly-F1000-2988.vtu
39K poly-F1000-2931.vtu
40K poly-F1000-2937.vtu
40K poly-F1000-2981.vtu
40K poly-F1000-2930.vtu
fail.pvd: load those 8 files

the other files can be sliced without any issues


Thanks,

Pierre

Hello

for your information there is a bug in the slicing of vtkPolyHedron that
can cause a segfault.
It looks very much like your error. It has yet to be corrected.
https://gitlab.kitware.com/vtk/vtk/issues/16877

You can already test this "work in progress" branch to see if this fixes
your issue  :
https://gitlab.kitware.com/vtk/vtk/merge_requests/2304

You could of course modify your data to tetrahedron with tetrahedralize
filter.

Regards,

Mathieu Westphal

Dear Paraview,

I have a 3d unstructured mesh with two fields defined over it - f(x,y,z) and g(x,y,z)
I want to create a movie of a following function

h(t) = f * sin(t) + g * cos(t)

where t is time. How would you do it?

Best regards,
Aleksejs Fomins

Ok that mean there is still a path issue when loading a file within
ParaViewWeb on Windows.

Did you look at the log of that given session to see if any error is
printed?

You can try to edit the file [lib/site-packages]/paraview/web/protocols.py
within the ParaView application (The [...] part is for the path section
that I'm not sure of).

In the function

    @exportRpc("pv.proxy.manager.create.reader")
    def open(self, relativePath):
        """
        Open relative file paths, attempting to use the file extension to
select
        from the configured readers.
        """
        fileToLoad = []
        if type(relativePath) == list:
            for file in relativePath:
                validPath = self.getAbsolutePath(file)
                if validPath:
                    fileToLoad.append(validPath)
        else:
            validPath = self.getAbsolutePath(relativePath)
            if validPath:
                fileToLoad.append(validPath)

        if len(fileToLoad) == 0:
            return { 'success': False, 'reason': 'No valid path name' }

        print "=" * 80        # <------ ADD THAT LINE TO SEE THE PATH YOU
TRY TO LOAD
        print fileToLoad   # <------ ADD THAT LINE TO SEE THE PATH YOU TRY
TO LOAD
        print "=" * 80       # <------ ADD THAT LINE TO SEE THE PATH YOU
TRY TO LOAD

        [...]

Then look at the log to see which path is used to load that file.

Hi,

There have been a lot of rendering improvements between 4.4 and 5.2 so
you'll definitely want to use 5.2 for the best performance. Also, 5.2 has a
lot of Catalyst and Live improvements. You shouldn't need to output images
or Cinema data bases in order to get the Live functionality.

Hi Ufuk,

Thanks for checking this out. Did you try out saving the trace as a pvsm
file? Did you get the correct result when loading the pvsm file back or not?

Can you share the data set and the generated pvsm file and the Python state
file?

Thanks,
Andy

Hi Utkarsh, Happy new year!

I have a couple of questions about the new way.

Shouldn't this be automatically added by ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN macro like 
the rest of the PV related link dependencies?
Should you really need to link Qt to all plugins?

My plugin is a number of simple server side only classes, for ex a 
reader. It has no need of Qt. I'd rather not have Qt as a dependency of 
my project.

Aleksejs,

Using brute strength and awkwardness, three conditions are needed:

(1) if your datum set is defined as f(x,y,z,t) & g(x,y,z,t),

(2) if both f(.) and g(.) are either cell values or point values, and

(3) if the variable 'time(.)' has been explicitly added as a datum set 
item (a name and a value),

then add PV's Calculator Filter to the pipeline where 'results' is 
replaced by 'h' and the equation is set as f*sin(time)+g*cos(time).

After selecting the 'APPLY' button, 'h(.) will be added to your datum-set.

(To the best my knowledge, 'time' is not available in the PV Calculator 
filter.)

Burlen,

Happy new year to you too!

Hmm, that's odd. Can you share the plugin code with me? Let's see if I
can reproduce the issue.

Hi Mathieu and Thomas,

Thank you for the suggestions.

1) I tried the tetrahedralize filter on my data but I did not get the 
results I was expecting. I have a polyhedron which is not convex 
(https://postimg.org/image/9s3egl8rz/) and the filter fill the gap as 
you can see here (https://postimg.org/image/5u1nt6d2h/) and it is not 
what I was expecting. Indeed, the initial purpose of the slice was to 
visualize the hole.

2) I tried this fix: 
https://gitlab.kitware.com/vtk/vtk/merge_requests/2088

And compile VTK alone. I used a python script (activating the python VTK 
wrapping) to do the test with the vtkCutter function but I ended having 
the same exact issue (segfault, no error message) with only the 
polyhedron that have more than 1024 faces. I am not sure I should get 
the same results if I manage to compile paraview. When I will manage I 
will get back to you.

sure, although I hope this isn't asking too much, as the build has a few 
dependencies, I think for this only NetCDF is needed.

here is the repo
https://github.com/LBL-EESA/TECA
plugin is in the ParaView dir.

Thank you all!

I'm using Kitware's binaries and 4.4 is with OpenGL 1 and 5.2 is with OpenGL 2. Now that this option has no impact on OpenGL2 backend, is there any other option (besides those mentioned in the User's Guide) that can improve the performance of PV 5.2? In my case, by turning off the display list, the overall performance of PV 4.4 is similar to that of PV 5.2.

For the new OpenGL2 backend setting ImmediateModeRendering or UseDisplayLists or something similar has no impact. Those concepts are part of the legacy OpenGL API. So you should see no difference in timings with them turned on or off with the new OpenGL backend.

A way to tell which type of build you're using is to loo at the title
bar. For OpenGL1, the title bar says "Legacy Rendering Backend". Such
a suffix is missing for OpenGL2 build.

For the first render of points your numbers seem reasonable. For subsequent
renders you will find different tradeoffs on the old backend. Display Lists
are typically slower for a first render but faster on subsequent renders.
With them turned off the first render is fast but subsequent renders are
not any faster. Subsequent renders with OpenGL2 should be fairly fast.

Hi

It may be a different issue than the one i'm fixing. If you can share the
segfaulting polyhedron, please do so i can take a look when i get back on
this issue ( which my not be soon, feel free to find other solutions)

Regards,

Subject: [Paraview] Problem reading a numpy NPZ file in ParaView 5.2.0 on
	Windows
Message-ID: <CAB8-E4BxPZ+RjVzm=Kd5nOXwpzHjD8L1bKrxn=b0J3QGp5zo5g@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

I want to report a possible bug.

I have a Python script that creates data, exports data in a numpy NPZ file,
and reads it later in a ProgrammableFilter.

With ParaView 5.1.2, everything works fine.

However, when I try it with ParaView 5.2.0, I have a weird reading error.

I have checked the 'About ParaView' window, but see no real difference
between
the two versions.

If I try to import the PV 5.2.0 npz generated file in another Python
interpreter with anoter numpy version (1.11.3), I have no problem.

So I guess, the PV 5.2.0 npz generated files are correct, but there is a
problem accessing its content from PV 5.2.0

Here is a script that reproduces the bug. It is to be run from the PV
interpreter.

    import os
    import tempfile
    import numpy as np
    outputFilename = os.path.join(tempfile.mkdtemp(), 'dummy.npz')
    varName='Time'
    np.savez(outputFilename, **{varName:np.random.rand(3,4)})
    d = np.load(outputFilename)
    time = d[varName]
    d.close()
    os.remove(outputFilename)
    print('Success PV can create a NPZ file and read its content : ' +
outputFilename)

Here is the message error on Windows with PV 5.2.0

>>> Traceback (most recent call last):

Hi,

As requested I attached with that email a list of 8 segfaulting 
polyhedrons. It happens with a centre of (0,0,0) and an oZ normal.

Subject: [Paraview] Custom source glyph error
Message-ID: <CACXVUXG4XLTLUfMNwHZye8Dzwp6rNOHhB_FJY-ccVCWpxYs4rg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm getting an error message (see end) using the "glyph with custom source
filter" for the case where the input points have associated results data
sets and the custom glyph source is of multiblock type.

I've attached two small sample state files that demonstrate the issue.

The custom glyph should be two hemispheres, one black and one white. One
state file shows the desired result, but the point source data has no
results data sets associated with it. The other state file has point
sources with two associated results data sets (mode1 and mode2) contained
in the attached Ensight *.case files. This second file gives the error
message below when loading.

Is this a bug or is there a filter that implements "CopyStructure", that I
should use?

Thanks for any suggestions,

Bob


The error message is:

ERROR: In
C:\bbd\df0abce0\source-paraview\VTK\Common\DataModel\vtkDataObjectTree.cxx,
line 306
vtkMultiBlockDataSet (0000000017C45180): Structure does not match. You must
use CopyStructure before calling this method.

Subject: [Paraview] Newer object always in front in Render View
Message-ID: <20170104151218.GA28983@avignon>

Hi,

I am playing with a 5.1 version of ParaView and I came across a bug or feature
which makes me a little dizzy. Basically, it seems that objects that appear
lower in the Pipeline Browser are always on top in Render View. That behaviour
was definitely not a default in earlier versions.

Is there a way to switch to a behaviour when objects culling based on the
spatial position? Please let me know.

I've taken a few pictures of radius 0.5 spheres displaced by 1 in the X
direction. Funnily enough the perspective is calculated properly so even though
the blue sphere appears behind it's actually bigger.


Kind Regards,
Robert

That's pretty crazy. You typically have to do some coding to get the
layering effect.

Try running with -dr to disable your preferences and settings. Also, please
share more information about your binary and OS as well as passing along a
state file to see if anyone can reproduce it.

David,

Thanks for a quick reply. Tried with -dr and it's the same. I am attaching my
state file for spheres. It may help someone to reproduce.

I am running it on Arch Linux and paraview is taken from AUR. I am just
looking at the way the binary was generated and I see these options in
cmake

  cmake \
    -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS:BOOL=ON \
    -DBUILD_TESTING:BOOL=OFF \
    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
    -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=mpicc \
    -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=mpicxx \
    -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/usr \
    -DCMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE:BOOL=OFF \
    -DOSPRAY_INSTALL_DIR:PATH=/usr \
    -DPARAVIEW_ENABLE_CGNS:BOOL=OFF \
    -DPARAVIEW_ENABLE_FFMPEG:BOOL=ON \
    -DPARAVIEW_ENABLE_PYTHON:BOOL=ON \
    -DPARAVIEW_PYTHON_VERSION=2 \
    -DPARAVIEW_QT_VERSION=5 \
    -DPARAVIEW_USE_MPI:BOOL=ON \
    -DPARAVIEW_USE_VISITBRIDGE:BOOL=ON \
    -DPARAVIEW_USE_OSPRAY:BOOL=ON \
    -DVISIT_BUILD_READER_CGNS:BOOL=OFF \
    -DVTK_PYTHON_VERSION=2 \
    -DVTK_QT_VERSION=5 \
    -DVTK_RENDERING_BACKEND:STRING=OpenGL2 \
    -DVTK_SMP_IMPLEMENTATION_TYPE:STRING=OpenMP \
    -DVTK_USE_SYSTEM_HDF5:BOOL=OFF \
    ${VTK_USE_SYSTEM_LIB} \
    ../ParaView-v${_pkgver}

Does any of this look suspicious?

Burlen,

Looking at the code, the problem is not with the plugin (or
add_paraview_plugin), which indeed add the dependency as appropriate,
the issue is in io/CMakeLists.txt [1]. When you use VTK_LIBRARIES,
you're linking against all VTK modules and its dependencies, which is
really an over kill. Instead, change to using COMPONENTS for the
find_package(VTK ..) or find_package(ParaView...) calls e.g. [2].

I'm currently working on adding the ability to use custom glyphs with
ParaView's glyph mapper. It will allow you to select a pipeline connection
for the glyph type (rather than the static list of arrow, sphere, etc).

Should be available in the next few weeks.

Do you mind printing relativePath so we can understand what you are
getting...

Then, you most likely will have to debug self.getAbsolutePath(relativePath)

I believe the issue here is that the glyph source must be polydata at the
moment. Does a dataset surface filter (or similar) help?

I mentioned on the other thread that I'm working on improving the glyph
representation so you won't need to use the filter to get custom glyphs.
This patch will also add the ability to use a composite dataset (with
polydata leaves) as the glyph source.

Cheers,
Dave

The cmake config looks ok to me.

What sort of graphics set up are you using? Is this mesa, or on a GPU? It
sounds like a driver bug or something may be causing the depth test to
break, or maybe there's a misconfigured framebuffer. Does an earlier
version of ParaView work on the same system?

Can you replicate this bug with one of the downloads from Kitware (i.e., paraview.org)?  The Kitware binaries work correctly for me...  Then, we will have a better idea if it?s the OS/graphics/hardware or ParaView...

David,

Thanks for a quick reply. Tried with -dr and it's the same. I am attaching my

I am running it on Arch Linux and paraview is taken from AUR. I am just
looking at the way the binary was generated and I see these options in
cmake

  cmake \
    -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS:BOOL=ON \

Does any of this look suspicious?

Hi Seb,

We did print them, and found:

relativePath: can.ex2
self.getAbsolutePath(relativePath): []

I do not have access to the machine right now. But will try out anything

debug.

Hi Dave,

In the state file, the glyph source is already polyData - created using the
sphere source (sensibly the gui doesn't allow selection of a non polyData
glyph source).

The composite dataset feature will be very useful for multi colored glyphs.

Thanks, Bob

On this computer I have two PV installed. One from AUR and one compiled from
OpenFOAM third party directory. The OpenFOAM works fine. It does say "Legacy
Rendering Backend" in the title bar which may or may not be significant. The
computer is running NVidia drivers and the card is Quadro. But I am reproducing
this problem on another Arch machine with some Intel integrated graphics card.

I'll try now Alan's suggestion and download it from Kitware directly.

Possibly unrelated, but we did see this odd behavior on some systems with a
paraview built against Qt5. It seems it lacked a depth buffer in that case.

        return None


But looking at the code, I can see why it may not work on windows....

Next you can try to replace

elif cleanedPath.startswith(self.baseDirectory):

by

elif cleanedPath.startswith(os.path.normpath(self.baseDirectory)):

Subject: [Paraview] Opening VTK data exported with CompositeDataWriter
Message-ID: <CADJb00yW+LqH2BBbHa38zLYe7j0_SCxP1+hLapYj1WeZyYgy3g@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all

I am exporting  vtkUnstructuredGrid and vtkPolyData wrapping them into a
vtkMultiblockDataSet and then written using vtkCompositeDataWriter to
create a data file in legacy format.
Trying to open this file in Paraview 5.2 64bit cause the application to
display the "Select Reader" dialog.

Should I use a different extension (.vtk/.vtmb) so Paraview can load and
display the data?

Regards

Yes -- there will be a drop-down menu on the property panel that lets you

Unfortunately, it looks like there will still be some hoop-jumping needed
for multicolored glyphs. The glyph mapping engine doesn't support
multicolored glyphs at the moment, since it doesn't fit well with the
current coloring logic in vtk/paraview's glyphing.

Cheers,
Dave

This might be obvious, but I'll chime in anyway. You could glyph the
data twice, one with the part of the glyph that should be white and
one with the part of the glyph that should be black. Then, just color
the two glyphed geometries white and black as needed.

Hi Dave,

The multi-colored glyph mechanism using using multi-block data is already
supported (see attached), but as I mentioned in my original message,
there's an error with it if the input point data to the custom glyph has
associated results data.

Thanks, Bob

Second attempt at posting:
---

I'm currently upgrading a reader module from using a pqAutoGeneratedObjectPanel to a using a property group widget (as per http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Plugin_HowTo#Adding_Customizations_for_Properties_Panel).

I have my bunch of properties in a PropertyGroup and have a panel_widget associated with them. Everything loads up, and using printf() I can verify that the property values are all being updated.
However, not only does it seems rather clunky, I cannot get the "Apply" button on the property panel to notice when the property values have been updated.

Here's a basic sketch of what I have:

// Get the property from the group (with down-cast):
    interpolateFields_ = group->GetProperty("interpolate");

// Provide a checkbox as widget for it - two-column layout.
  QCheckBox* b = new QCheckBox(prop->GetXMLLabel(), this);
  form->addWidget(b, row, col, Qt::AlignLeft);

// Connect to slot:
    connect(b, SIGNAL(toggled(bool)), this, SLOT(interpolateFields(bool)));

// This is ugly, but seems to be needed???
    interpolateFields_->SetImmediateUpdate(true);

// And the slot itself
void interpolateFields(bool checked)
{
    interpolateFields_->SetElement(0, checked);
    // this->setModified();
    //^^^ used to work with pqAutoGeneratedObjectPanel
}

I used to rely on the setModified() method from the pqAutoGeneratedObjectPanel, but now can't seem to get from the SMproxy to the pqProxy or whatever.

Or am I going about this entirely the wrong way?
FWIW, here are the relevant sub-entries from the XML, in case there is something missing there:

    <IntVectorProperty
      name="InterpolateFields"
      command="SetInterpolateVolFields"
      number_of_elements="1"
      default_values="1"
      animateable="0">
      <BooleanDomain name="bool"/>
      <Documentation></Documentation>
    </IntVectorProperty>

  <PropertyGroup
    label="General Controls"
    panel_widget="my_reader_controls">
    <Property name="InterpolateFields"/>
    ...
  </PropertyGroup>

Unfortunately, the  Examples/Plugins/PropertyWidgets is a bit scanty here.

Thanks for any advice,

/mark

Ah, gotcha -- yes, that will work. I was thinking of the case where not
only would the colors of the components differ, but the colors would also
vary from point to point. That was recently requested but no feasible with
the current glyphing code.

Cheers,
Dave

I dug into the error a bit and at a glance, it seems like it might be an
issue with the vtkCompositeDataPipeline (pinging Berk for this since he
knows more about composite pipelines).

The stack for the error is:

1   vtkDataObjectTree::SetDataSetFrom vtkDataObjectTree.cxx:305
2   vtkDataObjectTree::SetDataSet vtkDataObjectTree.cxx:242
3   vtkCompositeDataPipeline::ExecuteEach vtkCompositeDataPipeline.cxx:310
4   vtkCompositeDataPipeline::ExecuteSimpleAlgorithm
vtkCompositeDataPipeline.cxx:398
5   vtkCompositeDataPipeline::ExecuteData vtkCompositeDataPipeline.cxx:167
...

Since the glyph filter is not equipped to handle composite glyphs, the
pipeline iterates through all of the datasets in the composite glyph source
and executes the filter for each of them, combining the outputs into
another composite dataset. But for some reason, the output composite
dataset doesn't seem to match the input composite dataset's structure.

The odd thing I see is that ExecuteSimpleAlgorithm does call CopyStructure
before iterating through the glyphs at vtkCompositeDataPipeline:369. Not
sure why things are mismatched when the output is updated.

This indeed sounds like Qt 5  + OpenGL2 rendering backend issue. I am
actively working on a fix for that here:

https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/merge_requests/1262
https://gitlab.kitware.com/vtk/vtk/merge_requests/2300

Qt5 support in ParaView is not official yet. We hope it have it sorted
about before the next release.

Hi Dave,

Thanks for looking at that. I've experimented with creating point results
data within ParaView (rather than importing it from the Ensight *.case
file) using the programmable python filter and code stolen from the wiki
(see attached state file). In this case it seems that everything works as
expected with no error messages and as a bonus it also allows contouring
the results data on the glyphs, which you mentioned in a previous message.

One fix would be to convert all my data files from Ensight to vtkPolydata,
but I think that may be more effort than it's worth and would possible open
a can of malevolent worms. Maybe the Ensight data format isn't being
converted internally to the same format as the native vtk format.

Thanks again, Bob

Subject: [Paraview] upgrading reader module/plugin
Message-ID: <AM4PR05MB1811160E2E4646846528A7B4BD610@AM4PR05MB1811.eurprd05.prod.outlook.com>

I'm currently upgrading a reader module from using a pqAutoGeneratedObjectPanel to a using a property group widget (as per http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Plugin_HowTo#Adding_Customizations_for_Properties_Panel).

I have my bunch of properties in a PropertyGroup and have a panel_widget associated with them. Everything loads up, and using printf() I can verify that the property values are all being updated.
However, not only does it seems rather clunky, I cannot get the "Apply" button on the property panel to notice when the property values have been updated.

Here's a basic sketch of what I have:

// Get the property from the group (with down-cast):
    interpolateFields_ = group->GetProperty("interpolate");

// Provide a checkbox as widget for it - two-column layout.
  QCheckBox* b = new QCheckBox(prop->GetXMLLabel(), this);
  form->addWidget(b, row, col, Qt::AlignLeft);

// Connect to slot:
    connect(b, SIGNAL(toggled(bool)), this, SLOT(interpolateFields(bool)));

// This is ugly, but seems to be needed???
    interpolateFields_->SetImmediateUpdate(true);

// And the slot itself
void interpolateFields(bool checked)
{
    interpolateFields_->SetElement(0, checked);
    // this->setModified();
    //^^^ used to work with pqAutoGeneratedObjectPanel
}

I used to rely on the setModified() method from the pqAutoGeneratedObjectPanel, but now can't seem to get from the SMproxy to the pqProxy or whatever.

Or am I going about this entirely the wrong way?
FWIW, here are the relevant sub-entries from the XML, in case there is something missing there:

    <IntVectorProperty
      name="InterpolateFields"
      command="SetInterpolateVolFields"
      number_of_elements="1"
      default_values="1"
      animateable="0">
      <BooleanDomain name="bool"/>
      <Documentation></Documentation>
    </IntVectorProperty>

  <PropertyGroup
    label="General Controls"
    panel_widget="my_reader_controls">
    <Property name="InterpolateFields"/>
    ...
  </PropertyGroup>

Unfortunately, the  Examples/Plugins/PropertyWidgets is a bit scanty here.

Thanks for any advice,

/mark

Mark,

As you can expect, connecting Qt widgets to vtkSMProperty's on proxies
in a two-way-link is common in ParaView panels and hence ParaView
provides quite a few ways for doing that. For your use-case, where
you're connecting a QCheckBox to an IntVectorProperty on the proxy,
your pqPropertyWidget subclass can do something like the following:

Assuming your XML for the group is as follows:

QCheckBox *checkbox = ...
vtkSMProperty* smProperty = smgroup->GetProperty("InterpolateFields");
this->addPropertyLink(checkbox, "checked", SIGNAL(toggled(bool), smProperty);

That should do it.

Aleksejs,

The following should work:

* add a Programmable Filter to the source that produces the
unstructured grid with f and g. Set the Script property to

data = self.GetOutput()
data.ShallowCopy(self.GetInput())

and the RequestInformation Script to

timeSteps = range(100)
outInfo = self.GetOutputInformation(0)

timeRange = [timeSteps[0], timeSteps[-1]]
outInfo.Set(vtk.vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline.TIME_RANGE(), timeRange, 2)
outInfo.Set(vtk.vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline.TIME_STEPS(),
timeSteps, len(timeSteps))

You can change timeSteps to whatever values you want the time variable
to take on.

* Add a Python Calculator to the Programmable Filter, and set the expression to

f * sin(t_value) + g * cos(t_value)

Optionally change the "Array Name" property to "h". You can then
visualize the h field however you wish.

Hope that helps,
Cory

Ok. Yes I have now recompiled 5.2 version with Qt4 and sane render view is here
again. I will try to come up with a fix for AUR paraview package.


By the way, I probably gave you wrong info on my renderers etc. I've now
noticed the info is available in Help->About and it reads: OpenGL Renderer:
Mesa DRI Intel(R) Haswell Mobile

Is that right? Considering I've got NVidia card should I be using a generic
driver?

Best wishes,
Robert

Subject: [Paraview] ParaViewConfig.cmake created too late with
 ENABLE_paraviewpluginsexternal
Message-ID: <789dcd63-5dc9-70de-f414-07fb6b9c75b0@fau.de>

I think there is still an issue building plugins via 
-DENABLE_paraviewpluginsexternal:BOOL=ON when building 
paraview-superbuild.

cmake ../paraview-superbuild -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Release 
-DBUILD_TESTING=OFF -DENABLE_cxx11=ON -DENABLE_qt5=ON 
-DENABLE_boost:BOOL=ON -DENABLE_hdf5:BOOL=ON -DENABLE_zlib:BOOL=ON 
-DENABLE_png:BOOL=ON 
-Dsuperbuild_download_location=$HOME/code/cfsdepscache/paraview 
-DENABLE_paraviewpluginsexternal:BOOL=ON 
-Dparaview_PLUGINS_EXTERNAL:STRING=CFSReader 
-Dparaview_PLUGIN_CFSReader_PATH:PATH=$METABUILD/../plugins/CFSReader

results in the error

CMake Error at ~/code/cfs_paraview/plugins/CFSReader/CMakeLists.txt:43 
(FIND_PACKAGE):
   By not providing "FindParaView.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this 
project has
   asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by 
"ParaView",
   but CMake did not find one.

   Could not find a package configuration file provided by "ParaView" 
with any
   of the following names:

     ParaViewConfig.cmake
     paraview-config.cmake

   Add the installation prefix of "ParaView" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
   "ParaView_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
   "ParaView" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure 
it has
   been installed.

And indeed ParaViewConfig.cmake does not exist yet in 
ParaView_DIR=~/code/cfs_paraview/metabuild/build/superbuild/paraview/build

It works when I do the cmake ../paraview-superbuild first without 
-DENABLE_paraviewpluginsexternal:BOOL=ON ...
and then a second time with (as shown above).

However, we want to build the paraview-superbuild with our plugin 
automatically (e.g. in our nightly builds) with an own cmake project 
where paraview-superbuild is an external project.

Do I something wrong? Is this a bug? Any hint on how to do a workaround?

Thanks!

Fabian

Hi Seb,

It looks like the problem is how we specify the path in the command line.
We saw that / and \\ does not work as expected. Instead, putting \ works
perfectly. So, now we are using the following command, and everything works
as expected:

.\bin\pvpython.exe "C:\ParaView-5.2.0-Qt4-OpenGL2-MPI-Windows-64bit\
share\paraview-5.2\web\visualizer\server\pvw-visualizer.py" --content
"C:\ParaView-5.2.0-Qt4-OpenGL2-MPI-Windows-64bit\share\paraview-5.2\web\visualizer\www"
--data "C:\ParaView-5.2.0-Qt4-OpenGL2-MPI-Windows-64bit\data" --port 8080

Thanks a lot for your help. Much appreciated.


Cheers & Best Wishes,
Debopam

Subject: [Paraview] HPC Visualization Survey to Deliver Better ParaView
	Experience
Message-ID: <CA+Vq7tFAEok7ODX8yJhO+92XjVV6LYVjBu4d=O2aewO-GUi55Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Kitware and NVIDIA are collaborating their efforts to understand the
various aspects of the data that is visually analyzed by ParaView users.
Your responses will help us better develop features and offer products that
address your visualization needs.

We request you to take a short survey, which will take less than 5 minutes
to complete.

This survey is completely anonymous. However, providing us your contact
information will allow us to offer you early access to new products in the
future.

You will also automatically enter a raffle to win an NVIDIA Shield Android
TV.

Survey link: https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/HPCVizSurvey

We appreciate your time and feedback.

Regards,


Kitware and NVIDIA teams

Hello

Please check this ParaView 5.2.0 bug related to "Find Data" dialog and 
point selection, tested on Kitware linux and windows binaries:

Create one "Sources" sphere, theta and phi resolution set to 800. 
Selecting half of the points with a mouse using "Select Points Through" 
method takes a second or two.

Now open "Find Data" window, and just close it without doing any 
selection query. After this, selecting the same amount of points takes a 
minute or so.

This bug was not present on version 5.1.2.

Jyrki

The external plugins bit builds the plugin as part of ParaView's build,
not after it is built. You can detect this the same way the PointSprite
plugin in ParaView itself does so:

    if (ParaView_SOURCE_DIR)
      # Within the source tree already.
    else ()
      find_package(ParaView REQUIRED)
      # ...
    endif ()

Hi Jyrki,

Thanks for the report. I can replicate this issue that the second selection
takes significantly longer with PV 5.2 on my machine.  Would you mind
adding this in as an issue? You can do that at
https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/issues.

Thanks,
Andy

Jyrki,
I tried to replicate this, and could not.  For me, on a Linux machine, it took about 6 seconds to do the selection before and after Find Data.

Mind deleting your .config files and trying again?  Then, what operating system are you on?  You are not remote server, correct?

Alan

Sorry, missed this.  Andy ? you may want to write this up yourself, with detail how to replicate.  I couldn?t replicate it.

Add it to the Sandia project.

Thanks,

Hi Jyrki,
Thanks for the report. I can replicate this issue that the second selection takes significantly longer with PV 5.2 on my machine.  Would you mind adding this in as an issue? You can do that at https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/issues.
Thanks,
Andy

Create one "Sources" sphere, theta and phi resolution set to 800. Selecting half of the points with a mouse using "Select Points Through" method takes a second or two.

Now open "Find Data" window, and just close it without doing any selection query. After this, selecting the same amount of points takes a minute or so.

This bug was not present on version 5.1.2.

Hello,

How can I lock the light source direction to change with the 3d viewing
angle, so that the shadows with OSRay don't imply a moving light source as
I rotate the model in 3d?

Hi Scott,

Here's a state file, where the shadow of the cylinder is approximately
perpendicular the the arrows on the ground. As I move the model around in
3d with the mouse, I'd like the shadow to remain perpendicular to the
arrows, similar to how it would look if I walked around the cylinder on a
sunny day (assuming I didn't walk extremely slowly). I'd like the light
source to be fixed relative to ground rather than the screen - I'm
surprised that isn't the default or an option (at least I haven't found it).

Thanks, Bob

Bob,

There is no control for that just yet. Work is in progress to provide the
full complement of light controls. If you are working in builting mode, you
can resort to python as follows.

lights = GetActiveView().GetRenderer().GetLights()
for i in range(0, lights.GetNumberOfItems()):
   lights.GetItemAsObject(i).SetLightTypeToSceneLight()

Note: the light position bug in 5.1 that Alan was referring to had the
effect of making making the light positions fixed (scene lights in vtk
terms). In 5.2 that was corrected and now they are camera relative lights
that move with the viewer as they do with GL rendering.

hope that helps

Hi,

I've created a gitlab issue at
https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/issues/17098.

Alan, note that the both Select Through Points may be too fast to notice
the difference. On my machine the first one seemed instantaneous while the
second one took about 3 seconds or so.

Thanks,
Andy

ps. Jyrki: I cc'ed the PV mailing list again to make sure that everyone can
follow along with this.

Thanks David,

The Python code works well enough for my use. I see what you mean about
5.1, it almost does what I want, but is messes up the light directions.

Regards, Bob

Glyph Filter, type=2D subtype=points will create 1D cells (VTK_POINTS type)
for every point (those that are attached to cells and those that are not
used by any cell). To get only those points that are not used by cells, you
may need the programmable filter.

Hello,


thank you, but I mean how to pass these point data computed by a simulation 
code to ParaView in order to visualize them insitu. The Catalyst examples 
(https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/tree/master/Examples/Catalyst)
usually use some type of a grid and data are then attached onto it.




Cheers,

Ah, then you can skip the filter and directly make a vtkUnstructuredGrid
containing only points and VTK_VERTEX cell that index them.

See section 3 of the users guide for details. Somewhere in your adaptor you
will have something like the following:


output = vtk.vtkUnstructuredGrid()
pts = output.GetPoints()
cells = output.GetCells()
for i in particles.len():
  pids = [i]
  pts.InsertNextPoint(next_coordinate)
  cells.InsertNextCell(vtk.VTK_VERTEX, 1, pids)

When you get that working you will want to replace the inserts with direct
memory references to the  possible.

Guillaume,

Thanks for the report. I looked into this and I think I know what is going on.

In ParaView 5.2.0, we reduced the number of Python modules that
shipped with the ParaView binaries. One of the modules not included
was the "compiler" module. Now, Numpy checks to see if the "compiler"
module is available, and if it isn't, uses the "ast" module instead to
parse some file header data. However, Numpy doesn't correctly handle
the results produced by using ast.parse to parse the header data.

ParaView 5.1.2 shipped with the "compiler" module, which is why it
worked for you in the past. We'll have to add it back for the next
release. I've added an issue to track here:

https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview-superbuild/issues/43

Thanks again for the report.

Cory

Sorry about that, I missed the packages (foo/__init__.py) from the
standard distribution. The nightlies will have it next week at the

Subject: [Paraview] [ParaView] data from multiple servers rendered in the
	same view
Message-ID: <1E95A509-4459-4B7D-8CEC-BAAA853B7138@theweak.link>

Dear community of ParaView experts,

I am a new ParaView user and hopefully plugin developer, and first time
poster to the list. I hope the following will not sound too silly and I
thank you in advance for your replies.

There are several paraview servers setup and I am able to connect to all
of them from the Paraview application. I can properly visualize the data
on each server. However each data appear in a separate view and I would
like to render them all in the same view (because they happen to be
different type of data in the same volume of interest). These data are
not on the same server for proprietary reasons (e.g. server A and server
B are not held by the same people and do not share their data among
themselves).
Is there any way to "merge" the views together although they come from
different sources? I couldn't find it in the UI but I wonder if this
even possible/permitted by a software architecture standpoint. I would
be ready to develop a plugin for it but as I am still exploring the
devkit, I haven't found the answer yet (and I figured someone would know
if it's even possible at all).

I have searched the email archives (http://paraview.markmail.org) but
didn't find anything similar. I found a lot about comparing data in
multiple views or parallelizing the rendering of data but from the same
server.

Thank you in advance.
all the best
claude

Subject: [Paraview] paraview vtu to exodus. Using cell data as a criteria to
	make element blocks.
Message-ID: <CALmzmC8v4H=Mv77R1F6rLRLkn3M8Htrb5KiQNGsvY1OC00E1EA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all, i need help please.

Introduction:
My problem is that I need to convert a vtu file into an exodus formatted
file that reads several element block data.
When I load my data in vtu, all i see is a white cubic block.
This block has 2 data arrays named tetrahedra rank and tetrahedra number.
When I change my coloring to tetrahedra rank, I can see 2 colors red and
blue coloring my block.

I want to save the vtu file into an exodus format file and load it to
another software but the other software only shows me the output of colors
if there are several element blocks.
 In my case, the vtu file converted to exodus has only 1 element block.
In paraview, I can go properties, add the variables of tetrahedra rank and
then change coloring then i see what i want to see.
But in the software I am supposed to load the data, I can't do that.
Im supposed to make my exodus data into 2 or more element blocks and then
load it in that software which makes the software goes "ok so there are
various data ! lets color it".

I don't know what should i do to change my vtu file with cell data of
tetrahedra rank clearly showing the 2 data sets into 2 element blocks.
I have tried to use edit> find data> extract selection > repeat for the
next > group the data.
I get a multi block data set. It didn't work. I need 1 block data set with
2 or more element data inside it.

Please help,
Andi

Hi,

How to get the name of the active source in the pipeline? (the gui name)

gas=GetActiveSource()

Then what?

I've spent an hour or more on this.

Thanks, Bob

Hello Sam,

thank you for the quick reply, I may not be doing it properly then. Each
time I toggle on the object to view, it ignores the current active
viewer and opens it in a new viewer/layout tab (or the viewer already
"linked" to the server if I didn't close that view yet). 

I attached 2 snapshots trying to show the behavior: each time I toggle
on one or the other data, it switches automatically the layout (here
"layout #2" and "layout #3"). Even if I close one of the layout and keep
only one, it will recreate a brand new one.

The servers are started with "$PARAVIEW/bin/pvserver --multi-clients"
and Paraview is started with "$PARAVIEW/bin/paraview --multi-servers".
Is this because the servers are both data+rendering and I should instead
have 2 data servers but one rendering server maybe?

Thanks again.

cheers

claude

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview Vtu to Exodus. Single block, multi element?
Message-ID: <CALmzmC-Y9n7kiT5FQmLYZFHxBzvO65RNngMAcpJ0HbZhwSRDeA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all, i need help please.

Introduction:
My problem is that I need to convert a vtu file into an exodus formatted
file that reads several element block data.
When I load my data in vtu, all i see is a white cubic block.
This block has 2 data arrays named tetrahedra rank and tetrahedra number.
When I change my coloring to tetrahedra rank, I can see 2 colors red and
blue coloring my block.

I want to save the vtu file into an exodus format file and load it to
another software but the other software only shows me the output of colors
if there are several element blocks.
 In my case, the vtu file converted to exodus has only 1 element block.
In paraview, I can go properties, add the variables of tetrahedra rank and
then change coloring then i see what i want to see.
But in the software I am supposed to load the data, I can't do that.
Im supposed to make my exodus data into 2 or more element blocks and then
load it in that software which makes the software goes "ok so there are
various data ! lets color it".

I don't know what should i do to change my vtu file with cell data of
tetrahedra rank clearly showing the 2 data sets into 2 element blocks.

Hi Claude

Sadly, no, you can't.
However, one find you can do is use the interactive view link.
Right click on one view. add a CameraLink with the other view and check
"Interactive View Link"

You now have a "window" of a view into another view. Checkout the options
in the "adjust camera" dialog, you can set opacity and hide the background.

Regards,

Mathieu Westphal

Hi Utkarsh,

The addPropertyLink works exactly as desired and triggers the necessary update mechanism. For a few places I still have direct connect() to catch the signal and do something additional with it, but that was expected. I don't know why I still need an SetImmediateUpdate to get the changes propagated properly, but that can wait. The most important thing is that I can now load my reader module in paraview 5.2 and move forward.

Thank you,
/mark

Mark,

As you can expect, connecting Qt widgets to vtkSMProperty's on proxies
in a two-way-link is common in ParaView panels and hence ParaView
provides quite a few ways for doing that. For your use-case, where
you're connecting a QCheckBox to an IntVectorProperty on the proxy,
your pqPropertyWidget subclass can do something like the following:

Assuming your XML for the group is as follows:

QCheckBox *checkbox = ...
vtkSMProperty* smProperty = smgroup->GetProperty("InterpolateFields");
this->addPropertyLink(checkbox, "checked", SIGNAL(toggled(bool), smProperty);

That should do it.

Subject: [Paraview] vtkImageData Plugin, vtkImageData not rendered
Message-ID: <c67254f8275c449c8f506bff4d680d5b@RZJMBX1.jr1.local>

Hi

I programmed successfully a plugin source wich generates a vtkImageData output and made it the same way as on my 3d cloud plugins of vtkPolyData. The source is inherited from vtkImageAlgorithm and only contains one output with unsigned char array and one component. 

In the request data function of the filter I currently have a very dummy:

output->SetDimensions(oData.imgSizeX, oData.imgSizeY, 1);
output ->AllocateScalars(VTK_UNSIGNED_CHAR, 1);
 memcpy(output ->GetScalarPointer(), &oData.imgData[0], oData.imgSizeX* oData.imgSizeY*sizeof(unsigned char));

in paraview I see in the information tab that  I have an uniform rectilinear grid with 1917201 cells and 1920000 points (image is 1600*1200px). In data Arrays I get an "ImageScalars" of unsigned char and a correct range of my memcopy data (my min max range is not 0,255 so data seems to be there)...

the problem is that I cannot see anything in the render view, any suggestions what I am making wrong? I tested all representation (slice, surface, outline, on Solid Color and on my array), never see anything.....

I also compared the Information tab on a loaded jpeg image and cannot see any difference (which is rendered in render view except the Array's string name), by the way: can I disable "MapScalars" by default?

I am using pv5.2

Hi Mathieu,

Too bad, and at the same time understandable it is not possible in a parallel remote rendering architecture.
Thank you for the workaround!!
Cheers
Claude 

Thank you for the trick Mathieu.

I don't think `SetImmediateUpdate` should be needed any more. Are you
sure it's needed? If I remember correctly, it's one of the obselete
ivars that should truly be deprecated and removed.

Message-ID: <34df66e5c1d5491dadae50969e01bbaa@ES08AMSNLNT.srn.sandia.gov>

Andi,

You said you need an output with multiple blocks, but your last comment, ?I need 1 block data set with 2 or more element data inside it,? suggests that what you really need is to add a second field of data.

Try using the calculator to add that second field. Set the attribute mode to ?Cell Data?, the ?Result Array Name? to ?Dummy?, and the Expression to 0. Now when you write that out to an Exodus file you should have two element data fields: the original tetrahedral rank and the Dummy field you created.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [Paraview] Paraview Vtu to Exodus. Single block, multi element?

Hi all, i need help please.

Introduction:
My problem is that I need to convert a vtu file into an exodus formatted file that reads several element block data.
When I load my data in vtu, all i see is a white cubic block.
This block has 2 data arrays named tetrahedra rank and tetrahedra number. When I change my coloring to tetrahedra rank, I can see 2 colors red and blue coloring my block.

I want to save the vtu file into an exodus format file and load it to another software but the other software only shows me the output of colors if there are several element blocks.
 In my case, the vtu file converted to exodus has only 1 element block.
In paraview, I can go properties, add the variables of tetrahedra rank and then change coloring then i see what i want to see.
But in the software I am supposed to load the data, I can't do that.
Im supposed to make my exodus data into 2 or more element blocks and then load it in that software which makes the software goes "ok so there are various data ! lets color it".

I don't know what should i do to change my vtu file with cell data of tetrahedra rank clearly showing the 2 data sets into 2 element blocks.
I have tried to use edit> find data> extract selection > repeat for the next > group the data.
I get a multi block data set. It didn't work. I need 1 block data set with 2 or more element data inside it.

Please help,
Andi

Message-ID: <43b0ea5757cb4cdcad7f89eb7ef4ead6@ES08AMSNLNT.srn.sandia.gov>

I think the only way to get the name of the active source (or any source for that matter) is to search for it in the values of the dictionary returned by GetSources(). If you look at this dictionary, it has a set of keys that are a pair consisting of the name in the pipeline browser and a unique id string (in case two items in the pipeline browser have the same name). This rather obtuse expression should return the string of the name of the active source in the pipeline browser:

list(GetSources().keys())[list(GetSources().values()).index(GetActiveSource())][0]

Maybe someone knows of another Python binding I am not familiar with, but this should at least solve your problem.

The SetImmediateUpdate seems be needed for cases where I do bypass the addPropertyLink mechanism. Eg,

        QCheckBox* b = new QCheckBox(this);
        setButtonProperties(b, showPointNumbers_);  //<- text, tips etc...
        form->addWidget(b, 0, 1, Qt::AlignLeft);

        connect(b, SIGNAL(toggled(bool)), this, SLOT(showPointNumbers(bool)));
        showPointNumbers_->SetImmediateUpdate(true);

and then 

void pqFoamBlockMeshControls::showPointNumbers(bool checked)
{
    showPointNumbers_->SetElement(0, checked);

    // Update the active view
    if (this->view())
    {
        this->view()->render();
    }
}

Without the SetImmediateUpdate, the toggle of the showPointNumbers property doesn't get propagated to the reader until sometime later. Maybe the key is to signal directly to the reader?

Hi Gerald,

Not sure it is the only issue but please try giving a name to the output
scalar arrays.
ParaView won't make visible arrays which don't have a name.
Example:
  output->GetPointData()->GetScalars()->SetName("values");

Hi

Good try but does not effect anything except the string in paraview?s combo box. The strange thing is that I also cannot see anything in spreadsheet view (empty cell and point data)? but on information tab point data and cell data is there?.

Hi

I programmed successfully a plugin source wich generates a vtkImageData output and made it the same way as on my 3d cloud plugins of vtkPolyData. The source is inherited from vtkImageAlgorithm and only contains one output with unsigned char array and one component.

In the request data function of the filter I currently have a very dummy:

output->SetDimensions(oData.imgSizeX, oData.imgSizeY, 1);
output ->AllocateScalars(VTK_UNSIGNED_CHAR, 1);
 memcpy(output ->GetScalarPointer(), &oData.imgData[0], oData.imgSizeX* oData.imgSizeY*sizeof(unsigned char));

in paraview I see in the information tab that  I have an uniform rectilinear grid with 1917201 cells and 1920000 points (image is 1600*1200px). In data Arrays I get an "ImageScalars" of unsigned char and a correct range of my memcopy data (my min max range is not 0,255 so data seems to be there)...

the problem is that I cannot see anything in the render view, any suggestions what I am making wrong? I tested all representation (slice, surface, outline, on Solid Color and on my array), never see anything.....

I also compared the Information tab on a loaded jpeg image and cannot see any difference (which is rendered in render view except the Array's string name), by the way: can I disable "MapScalars" by default?

Hi

I programmed successfully a plugin source wich generates a vtkImageData output and made it the same way as on my 3d cloud plugins of vtkPolyData. The source is inherited from vtkImageAlgorithm and only contains one output with unsigned char array and one component.

In the request data function of the filter I currently have a very dummy:

output->SetDimensions(oData.imgSizeX, oData.imgSizeY, 1);
output ->AllocateScalars(VTK_UNSIGNED_CHAR, 1);
 memcpy(output ->GetScalarPointer(), &oData.imgData[0], oData.imgSizeX* oData.imgSizeY*sizeof(unsigned char));

in paraview I see in the information tab that  I have an uniform rectilinear grid with 1917201 cells and 1920000 points (image is 1600*1200px). In data Arrays I get an "ImageScalars" of unsigned char and a correct range of my memcopy data (my min max range is not 0,255 so data seems to be there)...

the problem is that I cannot see anything in the render view, any suggestions what I am making wrong? I tested all representation (slice, surface, outline, on Solid Color and on my array), never see anything.....

I also compared the Information tab on a loaded jpeg image and cannot see any difference (which is rendered in render view except the Array's string name), by the way: can I disable "MapScalars" by default?

I am using pv5.2

Message-ID: <CAB8-E4CNxkRvEa5YzH_R8CZg0B=Vs3O5a3ooL1dJy+NjTzJXdw@mail.gmail.com>

I have seen that Kitware developers have proposed a ParaView version with
support for Oculus Rift and HTC Vive HMD.
And it looks awesome, and opens a wide range of opportunities.

https://blog.kitware.com/taking-paraview-into-virtual-reality/

However, the proposed version does not embed Python scripting possibilities.

I would like to benefit from these functionnalities.

Can anyone give me some advice on:
- where to find the source code with the support for HMD
- how to compile to the code with Python support

The best would be a link to an installation file, but I am ready to compile
it!

Thanks

Guillaume Jacquenot

Subject: [Paraview] How to load different data files for multiple pvservers
Message-ID: <166d83d.207ab.159882e8580.Coremail.yzhzhang@ipe.ac.cn>



Hello,

I'm using ParaView for parallel visualization. My dataset is polydata, it is not "parallel aware". However, using the D3 filter, as the ParaView User's Guide says, is too expensive, which slow down the whole process significantly. As my data is  generated in parallel, I want to assign these data files to  multiple pvservers. For example, I have a dataset contains four files: file0.vtk, file1.vtk, file2.vtk and file3.vtk. Note that they are not temporal file series, but each represent a different area of the simulation domain. And, I start four pvservers by mpirun -np 4 ./pvserver. I can connect to the pvserver using paraview GUI on my PC, but I don't how to distribute the four files to each pvserver. I tried to select the four files using the Ctrl key and hit Apply, but it seems that they are all assigned to the process 0. Is there any way I can distribute the data files to each pvserver using the paraview GUI?

Thanks a lot!
-Zhang

Hi

It is quite simple.
First convert your file to modern file type, eg .vtu , .vtp or .vti
Then manually create a .pvtu/p/i with the correct syntax.

Take a look at the attached file file.pvtp

Regards

Mathieu Westphal

Hi Mathieu,

Thank you for the quick reply! I have some .vtp files and tried the way you told me, and got the result what I want. However, I don't know how to convert my .vtk files to .vtp files. Could you please give me more information about this? And, can I generate .vtp files from a simulation code by using some vtkwriter object?

Sincerely
-Zhang

Then manually create a .pvtu/p/i with the correct syntax.


Take a look at the attached file file.pvtp

Hello,

I have found that pvbatch is silently failing in a python file when
WriteAnimation
is called and used with ParaView 5.2.0 under linux.

But pvpython will execute the same command from the same python file
correctly.

The call where it is failing is below

WriteAnimation('full_image_path.png', Magnification=2, FrameRate=15.0,
Compression=True)

and it is not giving any error messages, it just never returns when called
by pvbatch

Has anyone else experienced this, or have an idea of how to correct it?

Thanks,

Joe

Hi Guillaume,

I hope to get some time to clean up some issues with the code and to merge
it into PV master. It will probably be a bit though as right now I am
taking another pass at the OpenVR VTK code which it is based on to add a
medical (volume rendering) example and a few options such as a floor etc.
Once that is done, I'll try to get to another pass on the PV code and get
it merged. For now the code can be found at

https://gitlab.kitware.com/ken-martin/paraview/commits/add_vr_2

but I believe that is old and not rebased to 5.2.0. Best bet would be to
rebase that to 5.2.0 and then update VTK to master to get the latest OpenVR
SDK fixes and then hope the two work/compile together.

Hi Joe,

I haven't seen this issue or heard anyone else with something like this.
Are you running pvbatch in serial? If you share a python script which
demonstrates the issue it may be an easy issue to track down.

There are some slight differences between pvpython and pvbatch. My guess
would be that it's due to pvbatch initializing mpi while pvpython does not
by default. You could try running pvpython with the --mpi option to see if
having it initialize pvpython gives you the same behavior. Also you could
try -dr to disable the registry (i.e. config settings) to see if that makes
a difference.

Cheers,
Andy

I recommend writing out your data as .pvtp instead .vtk files. The file formats are similar, but pvtp supports reading and writing in parallel. Both formats are documented here:

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [Paraview] How to load different data files for multiple pvservers



Hello,

I'm using ParaView for parallel visualization. My dataset is polydata, it is not "parallel aware". However, using the D3 filter, as the ParaView User's Guide says, is too expensive, which slow down the whole process significantly. As my data is  generated in parallel, I want to assign these data files to  multiple pvservers. For example, I have a dataset contains four files: file0.vtk, file1.vtk, file2.vtk and file3.vtk. Note that they are not temporal file series, but each represent a different area of the simulation domain. And, I start four pvservers by mpirun -np 4 ./pvserver. I can connect to the pvserver using paraview GUI on my PC, but I don't how to distribute the four files to each pvserver. I tried to select the four files using the Ctrl key and hit Apply, but it seems that they are all assigned to the process 0. Is there any way I can distribute the data files to each pvserver using the paraview GUI?

Thanks a lot!

Hmm sorry if I had took a closer look I would have seen that
AllocateScalars set a default name "ImageScalars" to the scalar array.
Then don't know what you did but the print says that the name of your array
is "21745593" which is quite strange. Is it what you did?

Could you write your "output" image data to a .VTI file using a
vtkXMLImageDataWriter after initializing it in your RequestData
function and see if you can load in with PV and view it? Share it if you
can't.

Mark,

After you've changed a property, you need to call
vtkSMProxy::UpdateVTKObjects() (or vtkSMProxy::UpdateProperty()) to
push those values for them to have any effect. However, in a panel,
you'd rather not do that.

For a few places I still have direct connect() to catch the signal and do something additional with it, but that was expected. I don't know why I still need an SetImmediateUpdate to get the changes propagated properly, but that can wait. The most important thing is that I can now load my reader module in paraview 5.2 and move forward.

Andy,

I have tried the various options --mpi , -dr and I also tried --mpi -dr and it 
had no effect.

What I did find though was that the compute nodes are running an osmesa build 
of paraview.
and I had been running in a hardware accelerated GL build of paraview when I 
ran pvpython.

When I forced it to use the pvpython version from the osmesa build (which is 
the one the batch file uses.)
I got this error.

GL_Version: ERROR: In 
/p/home/joeh/PV/Build_5.1.2_osmesa/paraview/src/paraview/VTK/Rendering/OpenGL2/vtkOpenGLRenderWindow.cxx, 
line 597
vtkOSOpenGLRenderWindow (0x2fcc250): GLEW could not be initialized.

When it hit the

WriteAnimation('full_image_path.png', Magnification=2, FrameRate=15.0, 
Compression=True)

line. This error message did not occur when running the GL build of pvpython 
from ParaView 5.1.2.

Thanks,

Joe

Hi Joe,


I haven't seen this issue or heard anyone else with something like this. Are 
you running pvbatch in serial? If you share a python script which demonstrates 
the issue it may be an easy issue to track down.

There are some slight differences between pvpython and pvbatch. My guess would 
be that it's due to pvbatch initializing mpi while pvpython does not by 
default. You could try running pvpython with the --mpi option to see if having 
it initialize pvpython gives you the same behavior. Also you could try -dr to 
disable the registry (i.e. config settings) to see if that makes a difference.


Cheers,

Andy

	Hello,

	I have found that pvbatch is silently failing in a python file when
	WriteAnimation
	is called and used with ParaView 5.2.0 under linux.

	But pvpython will execute the same command from the same python file
	correctly.

	The call where it is failing is below

	WriteAnimation('full_image_path.png', Magnification=2, FrameRate=15.0,
	Compression=True)

	and it is not giving any error messages, it just never returns when called
	by pvbatch

	Has anyone else experienced this, or have an idea of how to correct it?

	Thanks,

	Joe

Hi,
I just went back working on this project, the integratevariable filter is sloving my problem and giving nice results.?Thank you very much for the help.
Regards,islem 

    Le Jeudi 7 avril 2016 15h23, Favre Jean <jfavre at cscs.ch> a ?crit :
 

 #yiv0363527107 P {margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;}I recommend using the IntegrateVariables filter which will give the correct answer for wedges and pyramids. The output is put into an unstructured mesh with a single vertex cell, holding the "Volume" in its Cell Data. The implemented is in vtkIntegrateAttributes which triangulates the non-trivial cells into tetrahedra, performing the sum of all volumes within the cell.
?
The reason you get a -1 using the python calculator can be linked to the implementation of vtkCellQuality returning this->GetUnsupportedGeometry() (equal to -1) for wedges and pyramids.

I hope i didn't misunderstand anything or misphrase... The main idea is
that as shown in kenneth1.png, i need my element blocks to be of 2 arrays
not just 1. I can see its unnamed block id:5 but I want it to be following
my tetrahedral rank which is 1 and 2. In kenneth2. There is a clear
distinction of colors because i use my tetrahedral rank to color it. I
don't know how to make my block id = tetrahedra rank.

so my problem is actually:
How do i make object id = tetrahedrarank > hopefully this makes 2 data
arrays in element blocks.

Thank you,
Andi

Subject: [Paraview] Embedding the Visualizer app in the browser within an
	iframe
Message-ID: <CAAQFfXU5_E20G+Y0i9myZm4ZBMWSAW4rtdqooyvNhrg4UEXCPQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

We have a requirement where our application will send a request to the
paraview web server to render a specific file (which will be available in
the data given directory) in the visualizer app, and this will be embedded
within our application page as a iframe, whose source is the Visualizer
app's index.html.

We are using the pvpython.exe executable to start the paraview web server.
The command used to start the server is:

.\bin\pvpython.exe
"C:\ParaView-5.2.0-Qt4-OpenGL2-MPI-Windows-64bit\share\paraview-5.2\web\visualizer\server\pvw-visualizer.py"
--content
"C:\ParaView-5.2.0-Qt4-OpenGL2-MPI-Windows-64bit\share\paraview-5.2\web\visualizer\www"
--data "C:\ParaView-5.2.0-Qt4-OpenGL2-MPI-Windows-64bit\data" --port 8080


>From the command, we can see that the web content is being served from the
C:\ParaView-5.2.0-Qt4-OpenGL2-MPI-Windows-64bit\share\paraview-5.2\web\visualizer\www
directory.
The index.html file uses the Visualizer.js script and calls the following
functions:

Visualizer.connect({ application: 'visualizer' });
Visualizer.autoStopServer(10);

Is there any way to find out the available functions in the Visualizer.js
script and call them from our custom html file? What we intend to do is to
update the index.html file and
a. add a javascript function which will accept a filename to be rendered
b. once the filename is received by this function, it will call the
visualizer and display the specified file
c. in the visualizer page, the open files tab should be hidden.

Please let me know if you require any clarification.

Cheers & Best Wishes,
Debopam

Sorry for my late reply:

?21745593? is correct, that?s the UID string of the sensor/camera which generates the vtkImagedata, I set the string from its SDK?. I will try writing the vti file for you?.

Hmm sorry if I had took a closer look I would have seen that AllocateScalars set a default name "ImageScalars" to the scalar array.
Then don't know what you did but the print says that the name of your array is "21745593" which is quite strange. Is it what you did?
Could you write your "output" image data to a .VTI file using a vtkXMLImageDataWriter after initializing it in your RequestData
function and see if you can load in with PV and view it? Share it if you can't.

Hi Gerald,
Not sure it is the only issue but please try giving a name to the output scalar arrays.
ParaView won't make visible arrays which don't have a name.
Example:
  output->GetPointData()->GetScalars()->SetName("values");

Hi

I programmed successfully a plugin source wich generates a vtkImageData output and made it the same way as on my 3d cloud plugins of vtkPolyData. The source is inherited from vtkImageAlgorithm and only contains one output with unsigned char array and one component.

In the request data function of the filter I currently have a very dummy:

output->SetDimensions(oData.imgSizeX, oData.imgSizeY, 1);
output ->AllocateScalars(VTK_UNSIGNED_CHAR, 1);
 memcpy(output ->GetScalarPointer(), &oData.imgData[0], oData.imgSizeX* oData.imgSizeY*sizeof(unsigned char));

in paraview I see in the information tab that  I have an uniform rectilinear grid with 1917201 cells and 1920000 points (image is 1600*1200px). In data Arrays I get an "ImageScalars" of unsigned char and a correct range of my memcopy data (my min max range is not 0,255 so data seems to be there)...

the problem is that I cannot see anything in the render view, any suggestions what I am making wrong? I tested all representation (slice, surface, outline, on Solid Color and on my array), never see anything.....

I also compared the Information tab on a loaded jpeg image and cannot see any difference (which is rendered in render view except the Array's string name), by the way: can I disable "MapScalars" by default?

I am using pv5.2

Subject: [Paraview] Custom filter - coloring multi-block dataset
Message-ID: <CACXVUXH1OGYmCsU4FFYxTBGVe7FhgJj6eArtgGgTNWo8sWvaJw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Is it possible to edit the *.cpd xml file (or other technique) of a custom
filter so that the resulting multi-block geometry has a specific color (and
opacity) applied to each block, and the "Coloring" in the "Display
(GeometryRepresentation) is set to "Solid Color" rather than
"vtkBlockColors"?

The output from my custom filter has quite a few blocks that would each
require the color/opacity to be set manually using the multi-block viewer.

I thought of calling the custom filter from a Python macro, but when
tracing the action of changing the colors and opacity via the multi-block
viewer, nothing is recorded in the trace.

Thanks, Bob

Subject: [Paraview] Can ParaView Catalyst be used in GPU-based simulation?
Message-ID: <1948b84.29247.1598d60dec4.Coremail.yzhzhang@ipe.ac.cn>



Hello,

I'm using ParaView Catalyst for in situ visualization of some scientific simulation codes, mainly CFD and DEM. I have implemented a demo in which a small simulation code is interfaced with the ParaView Catalyst libraries. However, our major codes that are in use are based on GPU(written in CUDA) and the data generated by the simulation is in the memory of GPU. As far as I know, ParaView and VTK are CPU codes and in my case, I have to copy the data from memory of GPU to memory of CPU and then use Catalyst. That is not very ideal in respect of efficiency. I know there seems to be some professionals of computer visualization developing GPU-based VTK pipeline using CUDA, but I'm not computer professional and I can't use CUDA. I want to know if there is any open source  GPU-based VTK pipeline, or if I do have to copy data from GPU to use Catalyst, is it worth the effort?

Thanks a lot!
-Zhang

i have uploaded the vti onto
https://expirebox.com/download/60e7c1e8d177f282ae90d42f75e5ae50.html
the link is 48h accessible

when I load the vti into paraview everything is visualized correctly

Sorry for my late reply:

?21745593? is correct, that?s the UID string of the sensor/camera which generates the vtkImagedata, I set the string from its SDK?. I will try writing the vti file for you?.

Hmm sorry if I had took a closer look I would have seen that AllocateScalars set a default name "ImageScalars" to the scalar array.
Then don't know what you did but the print says that the name of your array is "21745593" which is quite strange. Is it what you did?
Could you write your "output" image data to a .VTI file using a vtkXMLImageDataWriter after initializing it in your RequestData
function and see if you can load in with PV and view it? Share it if you can't.

Good try but does not effect anything except the string in paraview?s combo box. The strange thing is that I also cannot see anything in spreadsheet view (empty cell and point data)? but on information tab point data and cell data is there?.

Hi Gerald,
Not sure it is the only issue but please try giving a name to the output scalar arrays.
ParaView won't make visible arrays which don't have a name.
Example:
  output->GetPointData()->GetScalars()->SetName("values");

Hi

I programmed successfully a plugin source wich generates a vtkImageData output and made it the same way as on my 3d cloud plugins of vtkPolyData. The source is inherited from vtkImageAlgorithm and only contains one output with unsigned char array and one component.

In the request data function of the filter I currently have a very dummy:

output->SetDimensions(oData.imgSizeX, oData.imgSizeY, 1);
output ->AllocateScalars(VTK_UNSIGNED_CHAR, 1);
 memcpy(output ->GetScalarPointer(), &oData.imgData[0], oData.imgSizeX* oData.imgSizeY*sizeof(unsigned char));

in paraview I see in the information tab that  I have an uniform rectilinear grid with 1917201 cells and 1920000 points (image is 1600*1200px). In data Arrays I get an "ImageScalars" of unsigned char and a correct range of my memcopy data (my min max range is not 0,255 so data seems to be there)...

the problem is that I cannot see anything in the render view, any suggestions what I am making wrong? I tested all representation (slice, surface, outline, on Solid Color and on my array), never see anything.....

I also compared the Information tab on a loaded jpeg image and cannot see any difference (which is rendered in render view except the Array's string name), by the way: can I disable "MapScalars" by default?

I am using pv5.2

Message-ID: <57ec2811a77d4a5d9961c5208ca3c100@MAR190n2.marin.local>

Hi everyone,

I am trying to use the programmable filter to combine multiple filters. Sort of like the custom filter but I want to have control over some of the properties using user input.

If I understood correctly, I can get the input data with:
input = self.GetInputDataObject(0, 0)

then I can use this input in a filter:
xMin = Clip(Input=input)
xMin.ClipType = 'Plane'
xMin.Crinkleclip = 1
xMin.ClipType.Origin = [-4.0, 0.0, 0.0]
xMin.ClipType.Normal = [1.0, 0.0, 0.0]

Now, how can I use the output of this filter as output of my programmable filter ?

Thanks in advance,
Pierre

Pierre,

First thing first. The code inside the Programmable Filter script runs in a
context in which it is aware of VTK only and not ParaView, so you cannot
use paraview.simple module functions such as Clip. Instead, you would need
to use a VTK-equivalent. In this case, you would use vtkClipDataSet:

import vtk

plane = vtk.vtkPlane()
plane.SetOrigin(-4.0, 0.0, 0.0)
plane.SetNormal(1.0, 1.0, 1.0)

clip = vtk.vtkClipDataSet()
clip.SetClipFunction(plane)
clip.SetInputData(input)
clip.Update()

Next, to use the output of the clip filter as the output of the
Programmable Filter, do the following.

self.GetOutput().ShallowCopy(clip.GetOutput())

Make sure you change the Output Data Set Type to vtkUnstructuredGrid if you
go this way.

Hope that helps,
Cory

Hi Debopam,


I think there is one thing to consider first before taking care of data
being passed through: if you manually start one instance of
pvw-visualizer, it means all people connecting to port 8080 will see the
same thing and act on the same viewer, which means potentially
conflicting with each other action (e.g. a probable disconnection for
everyone if one decide to exit maybe?). In that case, you need to have a
virtual server that will launch a new process every time someone connect
to port 8080. That way, all viewers are independent, the same person can
open several viewers, etc.


Now regarding the data being loaded at startup: you html index file
should have a function grabbing the 'data' parameter from a URL, a form,
a dropdown menu, etc. then sending it as a key to the Visualizer
application (so that the launcher knows which file to load at startup).

It would have been complicated to explain all the details in a email, so
I made a gist with all the files and "code" addressing both points
(launcher and data):

https://gist.github.com/clavicule/7b8b3963ceb17302cff725f8dc36bc57


Note that this gist was gathered info from the Paraview Web and
Visualizer online documentations: kuddos to Paraview people.
2nd note: in that gist I'm giving the instructions for Apache server
(you could technically choose any other, e.g. NGinx) for Linux.  I see
you are on Windows: I don't know how Apache works on Windows but I
assume (and hope) the steps and config file should be similar.

I hope it helps! Good luck!
cheers
claude

Message-ID: <3c68eb2b662f411ca50f1abf2e1e81b1@ES08AMSNLNT.srn.sandia.gov>

Andi,

I am having a really hard time trying to understand what it is you are asking. I?m not sure what it means to ?make object id = tetrahedrarank.?

I am going to make another guess at what it is you really want to do. You have data (from an Exodus file) that has a single block. One of the cell arrays is named tetrahedrarank. All the values of tetrahedrarank are either 1 or 2. You want to have a data set that has two blocks. One block has all cells with tetrahedrarank = 1. The other block has all cells with tetrahedrarank = 2. The following are the instructions to do that.

1. After loading the Exodus data, run the ?Merge Blocks? filter.
2. Run a ?Threshold? filter on the merged blocks. Set the ?Scalars? property to TetrahedraRank. Set both ?Minimum? and ?Maximum? to 1.
3. Select the Merge Blocks filter in the Pipeline Browser again and add a second ?Threshold? filter. On this second Threshold filter set the ?Scalars? property to TetrahedraRank and set both ?Minimum? and ?Maximum? to 2.
4. Select both Threshold filters in the pipeline browser and add the ?Group Datasets? filter. That will give you a data set with two blocks corresponding to the cells with TetrahedraRank 1 or 2.

I hope i didn't misunderstand anything or misphrase... The main idea is that as shown in kenneth1.png, i need my element blocks to be of 2 arrays not just 1. I can see its unnamed block id:5 but I want it to be following my tetrahedral rank which is 1 and 2. In kenneth2. There is a clear distinction of colors because i use my tetrahedral rank to color it. I don't know how to make my block id = tetrahedra rank.

so my problem is actually:
How do i make object id = tetrahedrarank > hopefully this makes 2 data arrays in element blocks.

Thank you,
Andi

Andi,

You said you need an output with multiple blocks, but your last comment, ?I need 1 block data set with 2 or more element data inside it,? suggests that what you really need is to add a second field of data.

Try using the calculator to add that second field. Set the attribute mode to ?Cell Data?, the ?Result Array Name? to ?Dummy?, and the Expression to 0. Now when you write that out to an Exodus file you should have two element data fields: the original tetrahedral rank and the Dummy field you created.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [Paraview] Paraview Vtu to Exodus. Single block, multi element?

Hi all, i need help please.

Introduction:
My problem is that I need to convert a vtu file into an exodus formatted file that reads several element block data.
When I load my data in vtu, all i see is a white cubic block.
This block has 2 data arrays named tetrahedra rank and tetrahedra number. When I change my coloring to tetrahedra rank, I can see 2 colors red and blue coloring my block.

I want to save the vtu file into an exodus format file and load it to another software but the other software only shows me the output of colors if there are several element blocks.
 In my case, the vtu file converted to exodus has only 1 element block.
In paraview, I can go properties, add the variables of tetrahedra rank and then change coloring then i see what i want to see.
But in the software I am supposed to load the data, I can't do that.
Im supposed to make my exodus data into 2 or more element blocks and then load it in that software which makes the software goes "ok so there are various data ! lets color it".

I don't know what should i do to change my vtu file with cell data of tetrahedra rank clearly showing the 2 data sets into 2 element blocks.
I have tried to use edit> find data> extract selection > repeat for the next > group the data.
I get a multi block data set. It didn't work. I need 1 block data set with 2 or more element data inside it.

Please help,
Andi

Hi David,
     thank you for the correction. It should solve the problem. Without
increasing sub it will remain 0 and the Resize call does nothing.

HI Zhang,

That has been done with PyFR with Catalyst doing everything on the GPU. I
see some stuff at https://github.com/vincentlab/PyFR-Catalyst that may be a
good starting point for you.

I don't quite know if Catalyst is ready for general use at this point on
GPUs (it may be but I haven't done it so I can't be sure). As Catalyst
development continues though it will be made much easier to effectively use
the GPU in situ. We will probably be using VTK-m for that.

If you want to go ahead with this effort, the ParaView mailing list can
probably be quite helpful.

Cheers,
Andy

Thanks Claude,

Here is the add-on of what functions can be called on Visualizer. (All the
function with export)

https://github.com/Kitware/visualizer/blob/master/src/app.js

We are planning to add some helper for extracting arguments from the URL.
We actually add a class in the ParaViewWeb repo, but we haven't got to the
point of using it and making it available in visualizer.

Subject: [Paraview] Migration plugin from pqNamedObjectPanel to
	pqPropertyWidget
Message-ID: <41b2f79df0c54b67975012d7bb92d08e@RZJMBX1.jr1.local>

Hi 

I am migrating my plugins from pqNamedObjectPanel to new pqPropertyWidget. I have 2 unsolved taskes in one of my more complicated filters left which I cannot figure out how to solve:

First Problem:

I have a small getterfunction with a text of my plugin filter which includes some information about the processing (computation time and a kind of fitness score during computation) wich I displayed in my old plugin widget of pqNamedObjectPanel in the overloaded updateInformationAndDomains() function:

void
pqMyFilter::updateInformationAndDomains()
{
    if(!this->proxy())
    {
        return;
    }

    vtkSMPropertyHelper oGetInfo(this->proxy(), "GetInfo");
    oGetInfo.UpdateValueFromServer();

    m_poInformation->setText( QString(oGetInfo.GetAsString()));
}


How can I do that with pqPropertyWidget? Or is there a better way (maybe somehow to bring it into the "Information" Tab instead of property tab....)

Second Problem:
I programmed a Attribute Array QTreeView of a certain kind of attributes of my inputs with checkboxes ( I only allow selection of attributes which are in all inputs). I already integrated it that it loads dynamically everything correct in constructor, but I miss a possibility of a callback/Qt Signal when input changes so that I can update that list..... any suggestions? In my old plugin I used

QObject::connect( proxy, SIGNAL( producerChanged(const QString&) ),
                      this, SLOT( updateMyList() ), Qt::QueuedConnection ); 

of the pqProxy proxy, but  now we use vtkSMProxy which does not have a producerChanged signal, any suggestions?

thanks

Hi Claude

Thank you so much for your detailed explanation. The gist has been very
useful. I am working on it at present, and is in the process of smoothening
out a few creases because of the operating system I am using (Windows 10).

Will let you know once I am able to use paraview web properly. And in case
of any issue, I will bother you once again.

Hi Seb,

Thanks for the link. Much appreciated.


Cheers & Best Wishes,
Debopam

Hi Utkarsh,

With many thanks to your hints, I also dug around to see what command_button was doing and this corresponds nicely what I needed. I'll put it here for anyone browsing the archives.

Cheers

void fireCommand(vtkSMProperty* prop)
{
    vtkSMProxy* pxy = this->proxy();
    prop->Modified();
    pxy->UpdateProperty(pxy->GetPropertyName(prop));
}

void fireCommand(vtkSMIntVectorProperty* prop, bool checked)
{
    vtkSMProxy* pxy = this->proxy();
    prop->SetElement(0, checked); // Toogle bool
    prop->Modified();
    pxy->UpdateProperty(pxy->GetPropertyName(prop));
}

Mark,

After you've changed a property, you need to call
vtkSMProxy::UpdateVTKObjects() (or vtkSMProxy::UpdateProperty()) to
push those values for them to have any effect. However, in a panel,
you'd rather not do that.

For a few places I still have direct connect() to catch the signal and do something additional with it, but that was expected. I don't know why I still need an SetImmediateUpdate to get the changes propagated properly, but that can wait. The most important thing is that I can now load my reader module in paraview 5.2 and move forward.

Subject: [Paraview] PV5.2 Scalarbar range error
Message-ID: <CACXVUXFUdD1+4sOC3C408u+0QPQwy_5XRdzERM1yJt+AquifaQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm using PV5.2 on Windows 7 64bit.

When a contour plot has a prescribed range that is quite small (or if the
range of data is small), the scalarbar ignores the upper limit and invents
its own. This was not so in PV5.1, so could be related to the new off-scale
color range feature (which was a most welcome addition - thanks).

Two state files attached, with error in PV5.2 and no error in PV 5.1.

Thanks, Bob

I'm currently using an ArraySelectionDomain to select items from (a very long)  list of mesh-parts (string names) as per http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Plugin_HowTo#Drop_down_list_with_values_from_input_file

It would be quite helpful if I could structure my list and use a tree-selection, but AFICT the closest thing might be a CompositeTreeDomain, but either this doesn't actually fit or I haven't figured out how to make it work.

Is this realistic to attempt?

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView 5.1.2 is not recording changes to the LUT
 position when tracing is one with all options (UNCLASSIFIED)

Hello,

ParaView 5.1.2 is not recording changes to the LUT Scalar Bar position and
size when tracing is one with all options.

And that even when I manually set the positions of the LUT in the script
file run by pvpython,

Paraview will seem to pull the settings for the lut from the last postion
that the lut was used in the GUI

and not like I like desire from the script values.

Has anyone else experienced this?

Thanks,

Joe

OK. That's weired, your VTI is correct.
And what if you save the output of your filter/reader with ParaView "Save
Data"? Is data correctly saved and reloaded correctly?

Subject: [Paraview] Decode a vtu file
Message-ID: <CALmzmC9Do2Tp0MeJjpTg5sMP01ZdHvskR_ztT7pB=PPDJndQxw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

Can I please have guidance/help in decoding a vtu file?

My file is a

      offset="812"                 />
      </Points>
      <Cells>

     />
      </Cells>
    </Piece>
  </UnstructuredGrid>
  <AppendedData encoding="base64">
  (data long list)

The file can be found in this link:
https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BzmZiSDoM7l3U2poYWNTbUhBWVU

I don't understand how to decode a vtk file and couldn't find anything in
google. I've tried using some scripts in python for base64 but it didn't
work..

The reason why I need to decode this is because somehow this vtk file which
load in paraview perfectly becomes a 2d file in another software "MOOSE" ..
So I think somehow in the encoded data is telling the other software "only
display the 2D intersection of blocks". But I want a 3D cube not a 2D
surface. If someone knows about this please tell me .

Thank you,
Andi

OK. That's weired, your VTI is correct.
And what if you save the output of your filter/reader with ParaView "Save Data"? Is data correctly saved and reloaded correctly?

Sorry for my late reply:
?
?21745593? is correct, that?s the UID string of the sensor/camera which generates the vtkImagedata, I set the string from its SDK?. I will try writing the vti file for you?.

Hmm sorry if I had took a closer look I would have seen that AllocateScalars set a default name "ImageScalars" to the scalar array.
Then don't know what you did but the print says that the name of your array is "21745593" which is quite strange. Is it what you did?
Could you write your "output" image data to a .VTI file using a vtkXMLImageDataWriter after initializing it in your RequestData
function and see if you can load in with PV and view it? Share it if you can't.

Hi

Good try but does not effect anything except the string in paraview?s combo box. The strange thing is that I also cannot see anything in spreadsheet view (empty cell and point data)? but on information tab point data and cell data is there?.

Hi Gerald,
Not sure it is the only issue but please try giving a name to the output scalar arrays.
ParaView won't make visible arrays which don't have a name.
Example:
? output->GetPointData()->GetScalars()->SetName("values");

Hi

I programmed successfully a plugin source wich generates a vtkImageData output and made it the same way as on my 3d cloud plugins of vtkPolyData. The source is inherited from vtkImageAlgorithm and only contains one output with unsigned char array and one component.

In the request data function of the filter I currently have a very dummy:

output->SetDimensions(oData.imgSizeX, oData.imgSizeY, 1);
output ->AllocateScalars(VTK_UNSIGNED_CHAR, 1);
?memcpy(output ->GetScalarPointer(), &oData.imgData[0], oData.imgSizeX* oData.imgSizeY*sizeof(unsigned char));

in paraview I see in the information tab that? I have an uniform rectilinear grid with 1917201 cells and 1920000 points (image is 1600*1200px). In data Arrays I get an "ImageScalars" of unsigned char and a correct range of my memcopy data (my min max range is not 0,255 so data seems to be there)...

the problem is that I cannot see anything in the render view, any suggestions what I am making wrong? I tested all representation (slice, surface, outline, on Solid Color and on my array), never see anything.....

I also compared the Information tab on a loaded jpeg image and cannot see any difference (which is rendered in render view except the Array's string name), by the way: can I disable "MapScalars" by default?

I am using pv5.2

Hi Claude,

I followed your instructions with some modifications since I was having
problems. Finally, I was able to configure the Apache front end with the
ParaView Web launcher, and now I can view the index page of the visualizer.
However, when I choose any of the sample files, they are not being rendered
in the visualizer pane.

I have added the details in the gist you created at:
https://gist.github.com/clavicule/7b8b3963ceb17302cff725f8dc36bc57

Would appreciate your thoughts on this.




Cheers & Best Wishes,
Debopam

Hi Debopam,

Thanks for the added details on the gist and congratulations for setting up the server, you are almost there.
For Visualizer to be able to load a file, it will need the argument --load-file (it seems to have disappeared in your config launcher). The option --data specifies the directory, so whatever file you want to load, it must be relative to that directory. For example to load the data file C:/my_data/dir/example1/my_file.vti you could do:
--data is C:/my_data/dir
--load-file is example1/my_file.vti

Here is a question for you: do you want to always have the same data loaded by default or to be able to specify it? 
* If it's always the same, you can directly hardcode it in the launcher config file. Then it will be loaded when you navigate to the paraview URL.
* if it's not always the same, you could use the solution on the gist which is specifying it in the URL directly (there are other alternatives of course). In that case, the URL must contain the file to load (otherwise paraview cannot guess it :)). For instance:
http://localhost:9000/?data=example1/my_file

(The JavaScript code automatically adds the extension .vti, you may change that behavior of course).

I'll be posting the detailed changes on your code in the gist comment shortly.

Let me know
Cheers
Claude

Finally, I was able to configure the Apache front end with the ParaView Web launcher, and now I can view the index page of the visualizer. However, when I choose any of the sample files, they are not being rendered in the visualizer pane.

In that case, you need to have a virtual server that will launch a new process every time someone connect to port 8080.

Could you share the code of your reader? If you prefer you can remove all
specific stuff and keep only VTK related stuff.
I would like to see how exactly you fetch the output grid to fill and how
your filter defines its output.

Cory,

Thanks for your quick answer and clarifying the context.

So if I try to reproduce the behaviour of the clip filter, I would do:

import vtk
input = self.GetInputDataObject(0, 0)

plane = vtk.vtkPlane()
plane.SetOrigin(-4.0, 0.0, 0.0)
plane.SetNormal(1.0, 0.0, 0.0)

xMin = vtk.vtkClipDataSet()
xMin.SetClipFunction(plane)
xMin.SetInputData(input)
xMin.Update()

self.GetOutput().ShallowCopy(xMin.GetOutput())

I changed to the ?Output Data Set Type? to vtkUnstructuredGrid.

I tried but paraview stops responding ...
Where am I doing something wrong ? and what am I doing wrong ?

Thanks,
Pierre

Pierre,

First thing first. The code inside the Programmable Filter script runs in a context in which it is aware of VTK only and not ParaView, so you cannot use paraview.simple module functions such as Clip. Instead, you would need to use a VTK-equivalent. In this case, you would use vtkClipDataSet:

import vtk

plane = vtk.vtkPlane()
plane.SetOrigin(-4.0, 0.0, 0.0)
plane.SetNormal(1.0, 1.0, 1.0)

clip = vtk.vtkClipDataSet()
clip.SetClipFunction(plane)
clip.SetInputData(input)
clip.Update()

Next, to use the output of the clip filter as the output of the Programmable Filter, do the following.

self.GetOutput().ShallowCopy(clip.GetOutput())

Make sure you change the Output Data Set Type to vtkUnstructuredGrid if you go this way.

Hope that helps,
Cory

Hi everyone,

I am trying to use the programmable filter to combine multiple filters. Sort of like the custom filter but I want to have control over some of the properties using user input.

If I understood correctly, I can get the input data with:
input = self.GetInputDataObject(0, 0)

then I can use this input in a filter:
xMin = Clip(Input=input)
xMin.ClipType = 'Plane'
xMin.Crinkleclip = 1
xMin.ClipType.Origin = [-4.0, 0.0, 0.0]
xMin.ClipType.Normal = [1.0, 0.0, 0.0]

Now, how can I use the output of this filter as output of my programmable filter ?

Thanks in advance,
Pierre

The file can be found in this link:
https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BzmZiSDoM7l3U2poYWNTbUhBWVU

I don't understand how to decode a vtk file and couldn't find anything in google. I've tried using some scripts in python for base64 but it didn't work..

The reason why I need to decode this is because somehow this vtk file which load in paraview perfectly becomes a 2d file in another software "MOOSE" .. So I think somehow in the encoded data is telling the other software "only display the 2D intersection of blocks". But I want a 3D cube not a 2D surface. If someone knows about this please tell me .

Thank you,
Andi

Subject: [Paraview] exodusII reader & writer in parallel
Message-ID: <CAMaOp+HcOYu2CfvXztNnQda6jEyTjzm-POLpJVrcGFM0ywmLRw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm trying out the ExodusII writer in parallel and had some questions about
how it should work in general when there isn't any data on process 0.
Currently what happens in ParaView is that a file for each process is
written out but the file corresponding to process 0 doesn't have any grid
information or field data (an example is attached). When I read this back
into ParaView using the built-in server (i.e. in serial) the ExodusII
reader gets the proper points and cells but no field data is read in.

So my question is this, does the ExodusII file format allow specifying
point and cell arrays in a file if no grid points or cells exist?

I'm tempted to fix this issue by modifying the reader to properly pass the
field data information to process 0 from another one that has data but
wanted to get the community's thoughts on this before I go through the
implementation. The alternative would be to modify the writer to include
point and cell data information and that's probably a better solution,
assuming that the ExodusII format allows for that.

Thanks,
Andy

ps. Attached is a sample set of ExodusII files that doesn't have any data
on parallel.ex2.4.0 in case someone wants to play around with it.

Andy,

That sounds like a bug in our Exodus writer to me. I?m not positive, but I?m pretty sure that you can specify in Exodus point and cell arrays if no grid points or cells exist. The writer is probably making a shortcut and skipping that if there is no actual data.

Hi Ken,

Thanks for the input.

There is an explicit check in the writer to see if there are any points
before writing out point data. I took that check out and am hitting a
NetCDF error that the "num_nodes" dimension isn't specified. It will
probably take a bit of investigating to fix this but at least you've helped
me go down the correct path.

Thanks,
Andy

It's looking like there could be a decent amount of hacking in the ExodusII
code to get the writer to work properly for this (as well as the reader to
read it back in without issues). The main issue appears to be that NetCDF
doesn't allow creating a dimension of 0 length/size. Thus the stuff in
VTK/ThirdParty/exodusII/vtkexodusII would need to be changed.

Both the reader and writer make the assumption that if the num_nodes
dimension exists that there are points to be read in.

At this point I'm thinking it's better to modify the reader than the
writer...

Yes, that is a basic assumption of the Exodus file format: each rank is assigned a subset of the cells and nodes in the simulation domain, since otherwise there is no state to store. If rank 0 of a simulation has no nodes (and thus cannot have cells either), then it should probably not participate in writing the Exodus dataset. You could create an MPI subcontroller without the rank 0 process and have the writer use that.

> At this point I'm thinking it's better to modify the reader than the writer...

I would be very wary of this.

Hmm. That?s disappointing. Although I?ve heard of files missing fields on element blocks because no blocks with that field is local, I guess having no data on a process is not something simulations typically experience.

I agree with modifying the reader then. I would not mess around with the third party code over this.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [Paraview] exodusII reader & writer in parallel

Hi,
I'm trying out the ExodusII writer in parallel and had some questions about how it should work in general when there isn't any data on process 0. Currently what happens in ParaView is that a file for each process is written out but the file corresponding to process 0 doesn't have any grid information or field data (an example is attached). When I read this back into ParaView using the built-in server (i.e. in serial) the ExodusII reader gets the proper points and cells but no field data is read in.
So my question is this, does the ExodusII file format allow specifying point and cell arrays in a file if no grid points or cells exist?
I'm tempted to fix this issue by modifying the reader to properly pass the field data information to process 0 from another one that has data but wanted to get the community's thoughts on this before I go through the implementation. The alternative would be to modify the writer to include point and cell data information and that's probably a better solution, assuming that the ExodusII format allows for that.
Thanks,
Andy
ps. Attached is a sample set of ExodusII files that doesn't have any data on parallel.ex2.4.0 in case someone wants to play around with it.

My worry here is that with the processes that have data possibly changing
between time steps I'm not sure how well it would be read back in since
there probably isn't a regular way to deal with that. The current ExodusII
reader complained trying to read in parallel.ex2.4.[1,2,3]
if I just deleted parallel.ex2.4.0. Also, how would time be supported in
this?

Yeah, this scares me as well with all of the blocks that ExodusII wants to
have in there but my thought was to basically skip reading in files that
had the num_nodes dimension not specified. Maybe there just isn't a good
solution here based on the format requirements. I'll test out modifying the
reader though and see what happens...

Exodus assumes the node IDs and cell-connectivity are time-constant within a single file. Each timestep the number of nodes and/or cells changes, a new Exodus file should be created. There's a convention for how filenames should change at adaptation steps as opposed to process rank.

Be aware that the vtkPExodusIIReader behaves differently on rank 0; during UpdateInformation, I believe it is the only rank to do some tasks in order to avoid slamming parallel filesystems with tons of identical requests. I know one of the tasks it does it discover the list of files to split among the ranks. I'm less sure about transmitting lists of array names to all processes, but it may do that from its own list of arrays, too. There was a problem long ago (that got fixed) where element blocks with no cells were missing arrays -- I don't think we've ever had processes with no points/nodes, though.

	David

Dear Kenneth,

Thank you for helping but i didn't mean understanding the text document if
that is what you mean.
I mean I want to access the appended data in base 64.

Maybe in command module somehow
(code to show the data)
data ..

Thank you,

Hi

Does it fails with all files ?
Do you download the sources from paraview website ?
Can you try with the binary version of ParaView on your computer ?

Dear Mathieu

Yes it fails with all files. Yes I downloaded the source of paraview from
official website and also as I said before I cannot compile paraview from
source on my local machine (that's a another story of unknown errors!), so
I run only binary version of Paraview on my computer which I downloaded
from official website.

Best,

Mehrdad

Message-ID: <308d751e.3557.159a176b4ba.Coremail.waynezw0618@163.com>

Dear everyone:
I want to make an animation, in which I want to show the unsteady flow field such as vortex shedding along with plot of forces acting on cylinders. The thing is forces is dumped in a separate file and the sampling frequency is different from that of dumping the fields. Beside I want show the plot of forces synchronize with the time steps of flow field. That is to say the plot only show the time history of current time step of the field. Can any body help me on that?

Happy new year!

Message-ID: <CAOWz9JCBFY6A1B0SKd+ZD=AaMA2yjqqQBWz7GygcYLM9rO+0gg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I am using paraview for my study purpose. I have NetCDF output file,
created by simulation model which I am working on. When I am opening that
file in paraview
it shows nothing (except total 3D domain of certain size), Since the values
are very small to display, is there any procedure for increasing those
values of my output file while analysing it in paraview without changing in
original NetCDF data.

Thanks and regards,

Hi Andi,

The document that Ken referenced (pg 15 onwards are what you need) are actually enough. However if I understand correctly, you probably just want a really quick solution and don't want to wade through all the details. My suggestion would be to load your file in paraview and then re-save it from there.

File > Save Data: vtm/vtp/vtu ...

You should get a "Configure Writer" dialog. Select the appropriate data mode (ASCII, unencoded) and this should give you really quick insight into the contents in an easily readable form.

Cheers,
/mark

I don't understand how to decode a vtk file and couldn't find anything in google. I've tried using some scripts in python for base64 but it didn't work..

The reason why I need to decode this is because somehow this vtk file which load in paraview perfectly becomes a 2d file in another software "MOOSE" .. So I think somehow in the encoded data is telling the other software "only display the 2D intersection of blocks". But I want a 3D cube not a 2D surface. If someone knows about this please tell me .

Thank you,
Andi

Hi

I uploaded a cleaned version of the reader without gui component to https://expirebox.com/download/b5db956fb2b0787ac16ef9b42e46698a.html (again 48h available). The GUI has included a timer which polls on the HasNewData() function and if it returns true it forces an update of the request data function.  I copied that workflow of the PCLPlugin of Paraview of the Kinect OpenNI Source?.. the commented code also displays the *.vti writing....

Best regards,
Gerald

Could you share the code of your reader? If you prefer you can remove all specific stuff and keep only VTK related stuff.
I would like to see how exactly you fetch the output grid to fill and how your filter defines its output.

OK. That's weired, your VTI is correct.
And what if you save the output of your filter/reader with ParaView "Save Data"? Is data correctly saved and reloaded correctly?

Hmm sorry if I had took a closer look I would have seen that AllocateScalars set a default name "ImageScalars" to the scalar array.
Then don't know what you did but the print says that the name of your array is "21745593" which is quite strange. Is it what you did?
Could you write your "output" image data to a .VTI file using a vtkXMLImageDataWriter after initializing it in your RequestData
function and see if you can load in with PV and view it? Share it if you can't.

Hi

Good try but does not effect anything except the string in paraview?s combo box. The strange thing is that I also cannot see anything in spreadsheet view (empty cell and point data)? but on information tab point data and cell data is there?.

Hi Gerald,
Not sure it is the only issue but please try giving a name to the output scalar arrays.
ParaView won't make visible arrays which don't have a name.
Example:
? output->GetPointData()->GetScalars()->SetName("values");
Best,

Hi

I programmed successfully a plugin source wich generates a vtkImageData output and made it the same way as on my 3d cloud plugins of vtkPolyData. The source is inherited from vtkImageAlgorithm and only contains one output with unsigned char array and one component.

In the request data function of the filter I currently have a very dummy:

output->SetDimensions(oData.imgSizeX, oData.imgSizeY, 1);
output ->AllocateScalars(VTK_UNSIGNED_CHAR, 1);
?memcpy(output ->GetScalarPointer(), &oData.imgData[0], oData.imgSizeX* oData.imgSizeY*sizeof(unsigned char));

in paraview I see in the information tab that? I have an uniform rectilinear grid with 1917201 cells and 1920000 points (image is 1600*1200px). In data Arrays I get an "ImageScalars" of unsigned char and a correct range of my memcopy data (my min max range is not 0,255 so data seems to be there)...

the problem is that I cannot see anything in the render view, any suggestions what I am making wrong? I tested all representation (slice, surface, outline, on Solid Color and on my array), never see anything.....

I also compared the Information tab on a loaded jpeg image and cannot see any difference (which is rendered in render view except the Array's string name), by the way: can I disable "MapScalars" by default?

I am using pv5.2

Hi Claude,

I tried using the filename hard coded in the config json as well as the
index.html. But I am not able to view the file in the Visualizer.
It is only showing the blank window/pane with no figure. I can move the
orientation axes, but nothing is being rendered. Even when I choose a file
from the Files tab, nothing is being displayed.

My launcher config has:

.......
"properties" : {
    "python_exec" : "C:/paraview/ParaView5.2.0/bin/pvpython.exe",
"visualizer":
"C:/paraview/ParaView5.2.0/share/paraview-5.2/web/visualizer/server/pvw-visualizer.py",
"data_dir": "C:/paraview/ParaView5.2.0/data"
  },
  "apps": {
    "visualizer": {
        "cmd": [
            "${python_exec}", "-dr", "${visualizer}", "--port", "${port}",
"--data", "${data_dir}", "--authKey", "${secret}", "--load-file",
"${data_dir}/can.ex2"
        ],
        "ready_line" : "Starting factory"
    }
  }
......


(You can see that the file name is hard coded)

The launcher.bat script has:

set PV_HOME=C:\paraview\ParaView5.2.0
%PV_HOME%\bin\pvpython.exe
%PV_HOME%\bin\Lib\site-packages\vtk\web\launcher.py
%PV_HOME%\launcher.config


However, I am able to view the file when I launch the pvpython.exe script
directly using:
.\bin\pvpython.exe
"C:\paraview\ParaView5.2.0\share\paraview-5.2\web\visualizer\server\pvw-visualizer.py"
--content "C:\paraview\ParaView5.2.0\share\paraview-5.2\web\visualizer\www"
--data "C:\paraview\ParaView5.2.0\data" --port 8080

So, I am guessing I may have mixed up some configuration items because of
which the display is not coming when I try to launch it through the
launcher scirpt/config. Surprisingly, there are no error messages in the
log files. Could you please suggest something.

I have added the details in the gist for your reference:
https://gist.github.com/clavicule/7b8b3963ceb17302cff725f8dc36bc57

The screenshots are also attached for your reference.

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView 5.2.0 client/server connection problem
Message-ID: <13c7d29.36981.159a7151dfd.Coremail.yzhzhang@ipe.ac.cn>


Hello,

I have a problem in using ParaView 5.2.0 in the client-server mode. Could anyone please give me a help?


Firstly, the operation system on my rendering server is CentOS 6.3 and on my PC it's CentOS 6.8. I think I have built the ParaView 5.2.0 successfully from the source package from Kitware on my server, because during the processes of configure with CMake and the following make, there was no error. Then I start the pvserver on the rendering server through VNC:

[root at V18 bin]# ./pvserver

Waiting for client...

Connection URL: cs://V18:11111

Accepting connection(s): V18:11111

Then I connect to the server with the paraview client GUI on my PC, which is also 5.2.0 and is built from the binary installer from Kitware. It seems that the connection is completed, but actually I get output messages from the GUI immediately like this:




And the command line reads:

ERROR: In /home/buildslave/dashboards/buildbot/paraview-pvbinsdash-linux-shared-release_opengl2_qt4_superbuild/source-paraview/VTK/Common/System/vtkSocket.cxx, line 572
vtkClientSocket (0x1c9aa20): Socket error in call to send. Broken pipe.


And this message repeats for dozens of times. Actually they are the same of the output messages on the GUI. Then, 5 or so seconds later, antoher dialog popped up :




For clicking No or Yes, the GUI shutdown or save a file that records the state of ParaView and then shutdown, respectively.


On the command line of the server, it reads:

Client connected.


X Error of failed request:  GLXBadContext

    Major opcode of failed request:  135 (GLX)

    Minor opcode of failed request:  5  (X_GLXMakeCurrent)

    Serial number of failed request:  28

    Current serial number in output stream:  28

I googled the error messages above and got many answers indicating that it's a problem about OpenGL.  When I configured ParaView with Cmake, the options of VTK_RENDER_BACKEND:STRING are OpenGL,OpenGL2 and None.  I have tried both OpenGL and OpenGL2 for that variable, but got the same error finally. The OpenGL version on my server is 4.4.0 and on my PC it's 4.5.0. There are GPUs on both the server and my PC so I didn't use OSMesa.  Here is the output form "glxinfo | grep OpenGL" on my render server:

OpenGL vendor string: NVIDIA Corporation
OpenGL renderer string: Tesla C2050/PCIe/SSE2
OpenGL version string: 4.4.0 NVIDIA 331.67
OpenGL shading language version string: 4.40 NVIDIA via Cg compiler
OpenGL extensions:

and on my PC, the output from "glxinfo | grep OpenGL" is:

OpenGL vendor string: NVIDIA Corporation
OpenGL renderer string: GeForce GT 730/PCIe/SSE2
OpenGL version string: 4.5.0 NVIDIA 375.20
OpenGL shading language version string: 4.50 NVIDIA
OpenGL extensions:

Oddly, the ParaView 4.4.0 works perfectly on the same machine after the same process of configure and make. Is that because that the 5.2.0 needs some new dependent libraries that the 4.4.0 dosen't need?


If you have any idea about solving this problem, please tell me. Thanks a lot!

Message-ID: <CAOr-WQvg5Ve_oVVFdxfcw4Gxhri_OvgRsjyD5poAPzj83Z745Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

I found several PLY files which crashed my ParaView based application. I
inspected vtkPLYReader.cxx and found (Ln 128-140) that it doesn't even
support loading PLY files with points.

Example of such PLY file:
https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse558/01sp/software/scanalyze/points.html
Example of software which successfully opens such PLY file: CloudCompare -
http://www.danielgm.net/cc/

Do you maybe have in plan adding support for such PLY files? Has someone
perhaps already implemented such feature and is willing to share it?

Thanks in advance,
Nenad.

Hmm, that's odd. Does it make a difference if you do things in the
following order:

* Add Programmable Filter
* Change the output type to vtkUnstructuredGrid
* Paste in script
* Hit Apply now, but only after the first steps have been completed

I recall that there is some funny behavior if you apply the filter and then
change the output data type, so my guess is to make sure the output data
type is set before applying.

Thanks,
Cory

I tried with 5.1.2 and 5.2.0-98-g5cacbab and both hang when I press Update.
I copied-pasted the script from the previous e-mail.

Thanks,

Cory,

Thanks for your quick answer and clarifying the context.

So if I try to reproduce the behaviour of the clip filter, I would do:

import vtk
input = self.GetInputDataObject(0, 0)

plane = vtk.vtkPlane()
plane.SetOrigin(-4.0, 0.0, 0.0)
plane.SetNormal(1.0, 0.0, 0.0)

xMin = vtk.vtkClipDataSet()
xMin.SetClipFunction(plane)
xMin.SetInputData(input)
xMin.Update()

self.GetOutput().ShallowCopy(xMin.GetOutput())

I changed to the ?Output Data Set Type? to vtkUnstructuredGrid.

I tried but paraview stops responding ...
Where am I doing something wrong ? and what am I doing wrong ?

Thanks,
Pierre

Pierre,

First thing first. The code inside the Programmable Filter script runs in a context in which it is aware of VTK only and not ParaView, so you cannot use paraview.simple module functions such as Clip. Instead, you would need to use a VTK-equivalent. In this case, you would use vtkClipDataSet:

import vtk

plane = vtk.vtkPlane()
plane.SetOrigin(-4.0, 0.0, 0.0)
plane.SetNormal(1.0, 1.0, 1.0)

clip = vtk.vtkClipDataSet()
clip.SetClipFunction(plane)
clip.SetInputData(input)
clip.Update()

Next, to use the output of the clip filter as the output of the Programmable Filter, do the following.

self.GetOutput().ShallowCopy(clip.GetOutput())

Make sure you change the Output Data Set Type to vtkUnstructuredGrid if you go this way.

Hope that helps,
Cory

Hi everyone,

I am trying to use the programmable filter to combine multiple filters. Sort of like the custom filter but I want to have control over some of the properties using user input.

If I understood correctly, I can get the input data with:
input = self.GetInputDataObject(0, 0)

then I can use this input in a filter:
xMin = Clip(Input=input)
xMin.ClipType = 'Plane'
xMin.Crinkleclip = 1
xMin.ClipType.Origin = [-4.0, 0.0, 0.0]
xMin.ClipType.Normal = [1.0, 0.0, 0.0]

Now, how can I use the output of this filter as output of my programmable filter ?

Thanks in advance,

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView and Qt 5
Message-ID: <CADHSJjCs7J3ynCrErE5A42L2zwxFzT6EKLggOQ2K-6=dxPpp=g@mail.gmail.com>

Folks,

With upcoming release (5.3), we plan to move to using Qt 5 by default.
Qt 5 has been out since 2012 and it is well supported on modern
platforms. ParaView will continue to build with Qt 4 until further
notice, but we highly recommend custom application developers and
plugin developers to move to Qt 5 at the earliest since active
development and testing for ParaView will happen with Qt 5.

Changes [1] that landed in master earlier today update ParaView to now
use QOpenGLWidget for rendering which creates a frame buffer object to
do all the rendering in. If you have custom mapper or rendering code
that assumed it was rendering to the default onscreen frame buffer, it
will not work correctly and will need to be updated. Please use the
mailing, if you encounter any such issues. For everything else, the
changes should be fairly transparent except in exceptions documented
here [2].

In the upcoming weeks, we will update the superbuild and dashboards to
build and test using Qt 5.

Thanks,
Utkarsh

Gerald,

I think there is the problem with this:
if (!this->HasNewData())
  return 1;

It means that most of the time, the filter will return an empty output.
Instead, you should cache (retain a pointer off oLatest as member variable)
the last image and ShallowCopy it to the output in this case.

Something like:

    if (this->HasNewData())
    {
        this->OLatest = this->m_poInternal->GetLatestImageData();
    }

    if (this->OLatest)
        poOutput->ShallowCopy(this->OLatest);

Best,

Subject: [Paraview] Filter for interactive spreadsheet?
Message-ID: <CACqg2jffcP8L1ROHR-YWp6hhx6jb1jS=+Yi7bWsM4kG_YuxtTw@mail.gmail.com>

Has somebody already written and contributed a filter that allows some
simple "spreadsheet like" user manipulation of the data?

I mean something that accepts some data input, then allows user changes,
and the output would be the changed data set.

Regards,
Cornelis

Hi Debopam,

Would you mind trying to connect while the web developer console is on
(for Chrome it's under "Tools > Javascript console") and copy/pasting
the errors (if any).

Do you see:

- a successful POST request to localhost/paraview

- a successful GET request to localhost/proxy

- then do you get an error such as "can't connect to ws://localhost..."?

Also, what do the logs tell you (/path/to/logs/error.log,
/path/to/logs/launcherLog.log and /path/to/logs/<SOME_UID>.txt => fetch
the last one created)?

cheers

claude

Subject: [Paraview] How to operate data from csvreader
Message-ID: <40E7C046-1D8F-4EE2-8BE4-4A1595BAFAE3@163.com>

Dear everyone:
I am trying to make an animation of line chart plot. Basically I want to show the time series before certain time step at the time step. My plan is to load the csvdata and mask them based on the time step value later after that make an animation. But I can only find cellData, pointData and so on like the vtk field data. I can't find my data in these. Can anybody tell me how to extract and manipulate the data from the csvreader?


All the best

/Wei

Dear Andy,

Thanks for this hint: Indeed I was not fully aware of the way how you can
easily add new calculated columns with these two filters! What they do is
some kind of "vector math", resulting in a new vector that is appended to
the input data set.

However my question went in the direction of directly editing single
values, or groups of values.

Example: Assume that we have a data array "Density" in some data set, then
I want to be able to directly change the "density" value for just a few
cells, or even better: for a selected set of data rows.

Because: If such a thing does not exist yet I would consider trying to
write it myself - but I do not insist on reinventing any wheel! And I am
sometimes astonished how many "wheels" already exist in the ParaView
"world"...

Regards,
Cornelis

PS: Why do I never see my own posts to the paraview mailing list? Is this a
bug or a feature or something I am doing wrong?

Good idea, I made some tests:

if (this->HasNewData())
{
this->OLatest = this->m_poInternal->GetLatestImageData();
}
else
{
vtkErrorMacro(?You should never came here?);
}

I also tested to set a member variable vtkSmartPointer<vtkImageData> myTempImage; to the class (like you mentioned) and store it everytime so that output gets always ShallowCopied regardless to the HasNewData, but no effect. The HasNewData is always true because I call this function from my GUI panel and only force an update if that function returns true, so it would be strange if that would not work?..

I have the exact same workflow in my  vtkPolyData source which works perfectly? I really don?t know why this does not work?. I copied the workflow from the PointCloud plugin?. (OpenNISource)

I also made now a minimalistic test and changed my requestdata function to:

 vtkInformation *outInfo = outputVector->GetInformationObject(0);
vtkImageData *    output = vtkImageData::SafeDownCast(outInfo ->Get(vtkDataObject::DATA_OBJECT()));


    vtkSmartPointer<vtkImageData> imageData = vtkSmartPointer<vtkImageData>::New();
    imageData ->SetDimensions(10, 10, 1);

    imageData ->AllocateScalars(VTK_FLOAT, 1);
    memset(imageData ->GetScalarPointer(), 0, 10*10*sizeof(float));
    output ->ShallowCopy(imageData);

same behaviour?.

Another failed try:

   output ->SetDimensions(10, 10, 1);

    output ->AllocateScalars(VTK_FLOAT, 1);
    memset(output ->GetScalarPointer(), 0, 10 * 10 * sizeof(float));



By the way: why dows paraview say that images are rectilinear grid's? My output is a vtkImageData which does not seem to be inherited from rectilinear grid.... also when I load images normally into paraview I get rectilinear grids as output..... should I program a rectilinear grid output filter?

Gerald,

I think there is the problem with this:
if (!this->HasNewData())
? return 1;
It means that most of the time, the filter will return an empty output.
Instead, you should cache (retain a pointer off oLatest as member variable) the last image and ShallowCopy it to the output in this case.
Something like:

??? if (this->HasNewData())
??? {
??????? this->OLatest = this->m_poInternal->GetLatestImageData();
??? }

??? if (this->OLatest)
??????? poOutput->ShallowCopy(this->OLatest);

Best,

Hi

I uploaded a cleaned version of the reader without gui component to https://expirebox.com/download/b5db956fb2b0787ac16ef9b42e46698a.html (again 48h available). The GUI has included a timer which polls on the HasNewData() function and if it returns true it forces an update of the request data function.? I copied that workflow of the PCLPlugin of Paraview of the Kinect OpenNI Source?.. the commented code also displays the *.vti writing....

Could you share the code of your reader? If you prefer you can remove all specific stuff and keep only VTK related stuff.
I would like to see how exactly you fetch the output grid to fill and how your filter defines its output.

OK. That's weired, your VTI is correct.
And what if you save the output of your filter/reader with ParaView "Save Data"? Is data correctly saved and reloaded correctly?

?21745593? is correct, that?s the UID string of the sensor/camera which generates the vtkImagedata, I set the string from its SDK?. I will try writing the vti file for you?.

Hmm sorry if I had took a closer look I would have seen that AllocateScalars set a default name "ImageScalars" to the scalar array.
Then don't know what you did but the print says that the name of your array is "21745593" which is quite strange. Is it what you did?
Could you write your "output" image data to a .VTI file using a vtkXMLImageDataWriter after initializing it in your RequestData
function and see if you can load in with PV and view it? Share it if you can't.

I programmed successfully a plugin source wich generates a vtkImageData output and made it the same way as on my 3d cloud plugins of vtkPolyData. The source is inherited from vtkImageAlgorithm and only contains one output with unsigned char array and one component.

In the request data function of the filter I currently have a very dummy:

output ->AllocateScalars(VTK_UNSIGNED_CHAR, 1);
?memcpy(output ->GetScalarPointer(), &oData.imgData[0], oData.imgSizeX* oData.imgSizeY*sizeof(unsigned char));

in paraview I see in the information tab that? I have an uniform rectilinear grid with 1917201 cells and 1920000 points (image is 1600*1200px). In data Arrays I get an "ImageScalars" of unsigned char and a correct range of my memcopy data (my min max range is not 0,255 so data seems to be there)...

the problem is that I cannot see anything in the render view, any suggestions what I am making wrong? I tested all representation (slice, surface, outline, on Solid Color and on my array), never see anything.....

I also compared the Information tab on a loaded jpeg image and cannot see any difference (which is rendered in render view except the Array's string name), by the way: can I disable "MapScalars" by default?

I am using pv5.2

I now have it (but don?t know why, an explanation would be great), my solution was deleting RequestData and using same pipeline as copied from vtkJPEGReader/vtkImageReader2 with request information:

int vtkROSImageSource::RequestInformation(
    vtkInformation       * vtkNotUsed(request),
    vtkInformationVector** vtkNotUsed(inputVector),
    vtkInformationVector * outputVector)
{
vtkSmartPointer<vtkImageData> latest = this->m_poInternal->GetLatestImageData();

    if (latest)
    {
        this->DataExtent[0] = oLatest->GetExtent()[0];
        this->DataExtent[1] = oLatest->GetExtent()[1];
        this->DataExtent[2] = oLatest->GetExtent()[2];
        this->DataExtent[3] = oLatest->GetExtent()[3];
        this->DataExtent[4] = oLatest->GetExtent()[4];
        this->DataExtent[5] = oLatest->GetExtent()[5];

        this->SetDataScalarType(latest ->GetScalarType());
        this->SetNumberOfScalarComponents(latest ->GetNumberOfScalarComponents());

        // get the info objects
        vtkInformation* outInfo = outputVector->GetInformationObject(0);
        outInfo->Set(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::WHOLE_EXTENT(),
            this->DataExtent, 6);
        outInfo->Set(vtkDataObject::SPACING(), this->DataSpacing, 3);
        outInfo->Set(vtkDataObject::ORIGIN(), this->DataOrigin, 3);

        vtkDataObject::SetPointDataActiveScalarInfo(outInfo, this->DataScalarType,
            this->NumberOfScalarComponents);

        outInfo->Set(CAN_PRODUCE_SUB_EXTENT(), 1);
    }
    return 1;
}

void vtkROSImageSource::ExecuteDataWithInformation(vtkDataObject *output,
    vtkInformation *outInfo)
{
    vtkImageData *data = this->AllocateOutputData(output, outInfo);

    vtkSmartPointer<vtkImageData> latest = this->m_poInternal->GetLatestImageData();

    if(latest)
    {
        data->ShallowCopy(latest);
    }
}

The only thing which is bad is that paraview does use "SolidColor" as default with "Outline" Representation. I have to switch to my scalar name and "Slice" representation manually, any hints how to do that automatically? Would also like to turn off "MapScalars" by default...

Betreff: AW: [Paraview-developers] [Paraview] vtkImageData Plugin, vtkImageData not rendered

Good idea, I made some tests:

if (this->HasNewData())
{
this->OLatest = this->m_poInternal->GetLatestImageData();
}
else
{
vtkErrorMacro(?You should never came here?); }

I also tested to set a member variable vtkSmartPointer<vtkImageData> myTempImage; to the class (like you mentioned) and store it everytime so that output gets always ShallowCopied regardless to the HasNewData, but no effect. The HasNewData is always true because I call this function from my GUI panel and only force an update if that function returns true, so it would be strange if that would not work?..

I have the exact same workflow in my  vtkPolyData source which works perfectly? I really don?t know why this does not work?. I copied the workflow from the PointCloud plugin?. (OpenNISource)

I also made now a minimalistic test and changed my requestdata function to:

 vtkInformation *outInfo = outputVector->GetInformationObject(0);
vtkImageData *    output = vtkImageData::SafeDownCast(outInfo ->Get(vtkDataObject::DATA_OBJECT()));


    vtkSmartPointer<vtkImageData> imageData = vtkSmartPointer<vtkImageData>::New();
    imageData ->SetDimensions(10, 10, 1);

    imageData ->AllocateScalars(VTK_FLOAT, 1);
    memset(imageData ->GetScalarPointer(), 0, 10*10*sizeof(float));
    output ->ShallowCopy(imageData);

same behaviour?.

Another failed try:

   output ->SetDimensions(10, 10, 1);

    output ->AllocateScalars(VTK_FLOAT, 1);
    memset(output ->GetScalarPointer(), 0, 10 * 10 * sizeof(float));



By the way: why dows paraview say that images are rectilinear grid's? My output is a vtkImageData which does not seem to be inherited from rectilinear grid.... also when I load images normally into paraview I get rectilinear grids as output..... should I program a rectilinear grid output filter?

Gerald,

I think there is the problem with this:
if (!this->HasNewData())
? return 1;
It means that most of the time, the filter will return an empty output.
Instead, you should cache (retain a pointer off oLatest as member variable) the last image and ShallowCopy it to the output in this case.
Something like:

??? if (this->HasNewData())
??? {
??????? this->OLatest = this->m_poInternal->GetLatestImageData();
??? }

??? if (this->OLatest)
??????? poOutput->ShallowCopy(this->OLatest);

Best,

Hi

I uploaded a cleaned version of the reader without gui component to https://expirebox.com/download/b5db956fb2b0787ac16ef9b42e46698a.html (again 48h available). The GUI has included a timer which polls on the HasNewData() function and if it returns true it forces an update of the request data function.? I copied that workflow of the PCLPlugin of Paraview of the Kinect OpenNI Source?.. the commented code also displays the *.vti writing....

Best regards,
Gerald

Could you share the code of your reader? If you prefer you can remove all specific stuff and keep only VTK related stuff.
I would like to see how exactly you fetch the output grid to fill and how your filter defines its output.

OK. That's weired, your VTI is correct.
And what if you save the output of your filter/reader with ParaView "Save Data"? Is data correctly saved and reloaded correctly?

Hmm sorry if I had took a closer look I would have seen that AllocateScalars set a default name "ImageScalars" to the scalar array.
Then don't know what you did but the print says that the name of your array is "21745593" which is quite strange. Is it what you did?
Could you write your "output" image data to a .VTI file using a vtkXMLImageDataWriter after initializing it in your RequestData function and see if you can load in with PV and view it? Share it if you can't.

Hi Claude,

Thanks a lot for your time and patience. As I have configured a virtual
host in apache, I am using the name of the virtual host (paraview) instead
of localhost. So instead of http://localhost, my url is http://paraview.
Please find my response below:

- a successful POST request to localhost/paraview

The only log that I saw in the developer console was: Navigated to:
http://paraview/ (Note: I did not give the data because it is already
hardcoded in the launcher.config file)

- a successful GET request to localhost/proxy

Nothing else was displayed in the console. I have attached a snapshot of
the network tab (not sure whether it has any relevant information)

- then do you get an error such as "can't connect to ws://localhost..."?

I get this error only when I specify "sessionURL" : "ws://paraview:80/ws".
When I specify "sessionURL" : "
ws://paraview:80/proxy?sessionId=${id}&path=ws" then there is no error.
Before starting the test today, I deleted all the log file, and after the
test the following are my observations:

1. the *error.log* file is empty
2. the *launcher.log* has some entries, but none of them are errors:

What is confusing me is that the native rendering panel is coming up on the
desktop, but does not show the image to be rendered. The same panel is also
coming up as part of the Visualizer pane, and if I move the orientation
axis in the browser, then the axes are also moved in the native window. In
the attached snapshot, the native window is on your left.

Hi,

 

                Can  someone tell us how to customize the Paraview Web
buttonbar, please? Exactly we would be interested in hiding Show File List
and Show Save Options buttons. Can someone say to us which section of code
could we edit to do this?

 

Thank you very much in advance, regards,

 

                               Gabriel.

Hi Cornelis,

How would you like to select the single or group of values to change? Also,
how would you like to change them (e.g. the same transformation for each or
each with its own transformation)? These two questions are meant to guide
you to do what you want in ParaView.

You probably want to look at the Python Programmable Filter (
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Python_Programmable_Filter) for changing
individual array values. If you are working in serial you may also be able
to bring in the entities to change based on a selection. A better solution
would be to use the global ids filter, then do a selection on what you want
and finally pass that in as a secondary input to the Python Programmable
filter.

Developing your own filter is also a possibility.

cheers,
Andy

Thanks again Andy!

I really appreciate your hints: It has already pointed me into a good
direction!

Actually what I tried for my purpose was:

1. do a selection, apply the "extract selection" filter, with the "keep
topology" option on. With this I am getting just one additional column -
"vtkInsidedness" - and this tells me whether in the initial data (actually
cells of an "unstructured grid") an item was selected (value 1) or not
(value -1).

2. on top of this I applied the "calculator" filter like you suggested, and
with just an if(1=vtkInsidedness, ...) I could get exactly what I wanted!

Bottom line: these two filters are actually my friends for the purpose!

Only two things I am still struggling:

1. if I want this procedure to be a bit more simple I should maybe still
write some kind of "wrapper filter" that does the above steps for me just
in one. Like derive one filter from the calculator, including the nice
calculator panel on the left, and just automatically do the "extract
selection" before applying the calculator

2. with the "python calculator" I was not successful, and I wonder why!?
Because if I applied that python calculator to my original "unstructured
grid" data set everything worked fine (so it is not about missing python
support!), but if I did the procedure as above, applying the "python
calculator" on the extracted data, I always got a message: "AssertionError:
Unsupported array type 15". This was independent on what was the expression
I tried to apply, even if it was just a constant value! Looking into the
source code it looks indeed like a mistake if some column has "type 15": I
found only about 10 type definitions at all...

Message-ID: <1ab4702b-2bb2-caae-37b7-807bd51fd3c9@fau.de>

ctest -R cpack fails on openSUSE but works on Ubuntu

CMake Error at

   OSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory

The reason is that fixup_bundle.unix.py:23 is called with

command_args=['ldconfig', '-v', '-N', '-X']

ldconfig is on openSUSE and Ubuntu /sbin/ldconfig but sbin in on 
openSUSE not in the user path. For me a link in $HOME/bin helped but 
maybe using the full path
would work on all unix systems?!

As you can see the issue is right there:

"--load-file", "${data_dir}/can.ex2"


As explained by Claude earlier in that same thread:

The option --data specifies the directory, so whatever file you want to
> load, it must be relative to that directory.

Thank you Sebastien! Good catch.

One addition to make sure the path to the file is correct: in the JS of
the HTML file in the gist, I specified data as being "data:
getUrlParameter('data') + '.vti'". In your case, the extension of the
file is .ex2, not vti. So make sure the whole filename is correct, for
instance specify the extension in the URL and not in the JS:

HTML -> "data: getUrlParameter('data')"

URL  -> http://paraview/?data=can.ex2

(Otherwise it will look for can.ex2.vti which does not exist)

Thanks very much Sebastien!

cheers

I guess we'll go with the full path. PR is making its way to the
superbuild via:

Subject: [Paraview] Floating point exception when using "Interpret Values As
	Categories"
Message-ID: <AM4PR03MB1874286A0BAE46F260705F18A27C0@AM4PR03MB1874.eurprd03.prod.outlook.com>

Dear Paraview Team,

I am currently working on a custom plugin which returns Polydata with an 
attached UnsignedCharArray as respective categories for all points.  I 
want to map these categories to colors using the "Interpret Values As 
Categories" feature. When I enable "Interpret Values As Categories" 
paraview immediately crashes with "Floating point exception (core 
dumped)" as console output. I tried using the feature with a couple 
other datasets (netCDF-format) and got the same result.

I am using paraview version 5.2.0-RC3-22-g3fca33d 64bit on Ubuntu 16.04.


Any indication what might be causing this behavior is much appreciated.

Subject: [Paraview] Increase number of slices for volume rendering ...

Hi,

for GPU based volume rendering, is there a way to increase the number of 
slices to enhance the overall quality of the rendering? If this can not 
directly be done in the GUI, would it be possible to adjust a scaling 
factor in the code?

Thanks and Cheers,
Niklas

Hi Cornelis,

I'm confused a bit. With PV 5.2 when I do Extract Selection with preserve
topology on I only get the vtkInsidedness array out from that -- do you
also get your other field arrays? I had to use the Append Attributes filter
to get all of the arrays back into a single filter output.

Also, I don't see an option for "if(1=vtkInsidedness, ...)" in the
Calculator filter. Did you get that to work for you and if you did, what
was the full expression? Using the Python Calculator I can do something
like "numpy.where(vtkInsidedness>0, -RTData, RTData)" to negate values in
the RTData array based on the vtkInsidedness array. Note that I had to use
the Calculator fitler to create a double type of array from the original
signed char vtkInsidedness array. This is because of the error that you
noticed which is that we don't have a way to create a numpy array from a
signed char array and thus the Python Calculator fails.

To answer your question on how to speed up this process, you can try doing
a Python trace and saving that as a Macro button or maybe create a custom
filter that combines all of those filters. Details on both of those should
be in the ParaView Users Guide.

Best,
Andy

Hi Mathieu,
Yes I tried the binary version on my server but same result. Now I compiled
ParaView 5.2 from source on my local machine exactly as the same of my
server and when I opened my file, I got these error on the client and
server sides respectively:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

client side:

'vtkPolarAxesRepresentation'. This typically means that ParaView does not
know about the request class to create an instance of if. Ensure that it
has been correctly wrapped using the client-server wrappers and the
wrapping has been initialized. Note class names are case-sensitive. Check
for typos. Aborting for debugging purposes.

Hi Mehrdad,

If you are compiling the ParaView git repository, please make sure
that you run 'git submodule udpate --init' in the git repository to
ensure that VTK is up to date on both the client and server. Not doing
this has been responsible for this kind of error in a number of cases
in the past.

HTH,
Cory

Dear Cory,

Yes, exactly I know your point and I'm sure that I compiled VTK 7.1 with

Best,

Mehrdad

Hi Seb & Claude,

Thanks for pointing out the error, but still I am having the same problem.
No matter what I do, I am not able to show the figure in the visualizer
pane. It is always black/blank. :(

This is what I did:
1. Used hard coded (can.ex2)  as well as dynamic (${data}) for the data
file,
2. I even hardcoded the data value in the index.html file,
3. I tried using http://paraview as well as http://paraview/?data=can.ex2
4. In the visualizer Files tab, I selected each of the data files (can.ex2,
disc_out_ref.ex2, headsq.vti)

But in all these cases, I was not able to see any output in the visualizer
pane. In each case, the native window name Visualization Toolkit -
Win32OpenGL #n showed up with nothing except the orientation axes. The same
window showed up within the browser, and when I moved the orientation axes
on the browser, the axes also moved in the native window. The later shows
that the native window is connected and responds to the browser actions
(through web sockets I believe).

What I fail to understand is why is the *data file selected from the Files
tab* in the Visualizer console (in browser) not showing up in the
Visualizer pane. This the seems to be the basic problem. For instance, when
I start the Visualizer through the pvpython using the pvw-visualizer.py
script it works absolutely ok. Which shows that there is no problem with my
graphics card or Paraview installation.

*startpvw.bat:*

.\bin\pvpython.exe
"C:\paraview\ParaView5.2.0\share\paraview-5.2\web\visualizer\server\pvw-visualizer.py"
--content "C:\paraview\ParaView5.2.0\share\paraview-5.2\web\visualizer\www"
--data "C:\paraview\ParaView5.2.0\data" --port 9000


But when I run the launcher using the command:
*launcher.bat:*

set PV_HOME=C:\paraview\ParaView5.2.0
%PV_HOME%\bin\pvpython.exe
%PV_HOME%\bin\Lib\site-packages\vtk\web\launcher.py
%PV_HOME%\launcher.config

and then access the visualizer through the apache front end, then the data
file is not being rendered.

So, I guess there is something wrong with the way I am calling the
visualizer from the launcher and the way it is called with the
pvw-visualizer.py script.

Your continued support is much appreciated. I am attaching the relevant
files for your reference.


Cheers & Best Wishes,
Debopam

Well we fixed that issue last time in another thread. Here is the
difference:

Launcher configuration (Not working)
"C:/paraview/ParaView5.2.0/data"

Command line (Working)
"C:\paraview\ParaView5.2.0\data"

Do you notice any difference? Do you see what you should try next?

Message-ID: <CAFRVdT9n7XqL_aBxZJpRKZNECjAQRCbi0tQmzxn2NheAzn7qVA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am struggling with a very simple task in ParaView. I have 500 time steps
that represent an object moving in space. I would like to display all the
positions of the object (thus, the trajectory) in a single window.

I have a set of 500 *.vtu files and a pvd collection that I can
successfully load into ParaView to play with the time. How to display all
time steps in the window, or alternatively, how to merge all these *.vtu
files into a single unstructured mesh?

Apply the "Group TimeSteps" filter to your reader. That will create a
new dataset that has all timesteps in it. If I am not mistaken, this
filter was added in 5.2, so if it's not present under the "Temporal"
filter menu with your version of ParaView, try the latest version.

I'm trying to compile a paraview using a Qt5 (5.7.1) that I've compiled with '-qt-xcb' to avoid too many dependencies. When compiling paraview (git version), I supposed that the following would be sufficient to convey which qt to use:

cmake -DPARAVIEW_BUILD_QT_GUI=ON -DQT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE:FILEPATH=/software/path/qt-5.7.1/bin/qmake -DPARAVIEW_QT_VERSION:STRING=5  ...

However, the find_package(Qt5) locates the system Qt and its cmake file, which bombs out:

CMake Error at CMake/ParaViewQt.cmake:65 (find_package):
  Could not find a configuration file for package "Qt5" that is compatible
  with requested version "5.6".
  The following configuration files were considered but not accepted:
    /usr/lib64/cmake/Qt5/Qt5Config.cmake, version: 5.5.1
    /usr/lib64/cmake/Qt5/Qt5Config.cmake, version: 5.5.1
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  Qt/Widgets/CMakeLists.txt:200 (pv_find_package_qt)


Which config variables am I missing?

Thanks,
/mark

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView and Qt 5

Folks,

With upcoming release (5.3), we plan to move to using Qt 5 by default.
Qt 5 has been out since 2012 and it is well supported on modern
platforms. ParaView will continue to build with Qt 4 until further
notice, but we highly recommend custom application developers and
plugin developers to move to Qt 5 at the earliest since active
development and testing for ParaView will happen with Qt 5.

Changes [1] that landed in master earlier today update ParaView to now
use QOpenGLWidget for rendering which creates a frame buffer object to
do all the rendering in. If you have custom mapper or rendering code
that assumed it was rendering to the default onscreen frame buffer, it
will not work correctly and will need to be updated. Please use the
mailing, if you encounter any such issues. For everything else, the
changes should be fairly transparent except in exceptions documented
here [2].

In the upcoming weeks, we will update the superbuild and dashboards to
build and test using Qt 5.

Thanks,
Utkarsh

Hi Mark,

CMake uses different variables to find Qt4 vs Qt5.  QT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE is
the Qt4 variable and is ignored by the code to find Qt5.  The variable you
want is: -DQt5_DIR=/software/path/qt-5.7.1/lib/cmake/Qt5

HTH,
Shawn

Subject: [Paraview] size limit to loading annotated but file 4095 time steps
Message-ID: <DAEBB661-73D9-4AA5-90D6-341DD231F84D@victorchang.edu.au>

Hi all

We are using paraview to visualise a time series corresponding to propagation of a voltage waveform in a 2D domain.

Data is a .vtu file annotated with time points. Total series is >10,000 time steps. All confirmed as being annotated correctly

When we load into paraview (5.2), only the first 4095 time steps are imported.

Any ideas why this might be? Is there some sort of 12 bit limit being imposed somewhere? Any workarounds people can suggest?

Cheers

A

Subject: [Paraview] Strange error building paraview-superbuild als nightly
	build
Message-ID: <fd0ec133-6444-1978-1b8e-0fef390c5de5@fau.de>

Hello,

I have a strange error. The issue is not very important, just a nice 
to have.

I have a simple project building paraview-superbuild as external 
project which includes applying two simple patches
(add building of the libs boost_filesystem and hdf5_cpp) and our 
external plugin.

When run the project manually (cmake ..) it works reproducible 
perfectly smooth on several Linux machines and Mac.

When I run the project via ctest for a nightly build I have errors 
building qt5. When I do 'make' in my project or
the paraview-superbuild project all runs without any notice of a 
error, simply in install/bin no paraview stuff built.

I diffed Testing/Temporary/LastBuild_20170118-1244.log with the output 
from my manual build.
All is more or less the same but sometimes differently ordered due to 
parallal building (which I don't trigger actively)

The real difference start in the ctest log in line ~36500
with

The CMakeCache.txt in my build directory and the paraview-superbuild

Anyone has any idea? I can live without nightly builds but it would be

Hi Mark,

CMake uses different variables to find Qt4 vs Qt5.  QT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE is the Qt4 variable and is ignored by the code to find Qt5.  The variable you want is: -DQt5_DIR=/software/path/qt-5.7.1/lib/cmake/Qt5

HTH,
Shawn

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView and Qt 5

Folks,

With upcoming release (5.3), we plan to move to using Qt 5 by default.
Qt 5 has been out since 2012 and it is well supported on modern
platforms. ParaView will continue to build with Qt 4 until further
notice, but we highly recommend custom application developers and
plugin developers to move to Qt 5 at the earliest since active
development and testing for ParaView will happen with Qt 5.

Changes [1] that landed in master earlier today update ParaView to now
use QOpenGLWidget for rendering which creates a frame buffer object to
do all the rendering in. If you have custom mapper or rendering code
that assumed it was rendering to the default onscreen frame buffer, it
will not work correctly and will need to be updated. Please use the
mailing, if you encounter any such issues. For everything else, the
changes should be fairly transparent except in exceptions documented
here [2].

In the upcoming weeks, we will update the superbuild and dashboards to
build and test using Qt 5.

Thanks,
Utkarsh

Subject: [Paraview] Problems writing binary vtu file
Message-ID: <96dba2f1-e8cd-16b6-ddfe-656844397966@lspr.swiss>

Dear Paraview,

I tried to extend my VTU writer to write into binary format. I have tried either writing floats using Float32 format and doubles using Float64 format, both fail the same way. I write into binary by using

file.write( (char*) &binarydata, sizeof(BinaryType));

In both cases, Paraview complains that there is an invalid token immediately at the beginning of binary output within the first DataArray clause.

Could someone please hint me as of what I am doing wrong.

Regards,
Aleksejs

Hi Niklas,

unfortunately sampling distance is currently not exposed as a UI setting.
You could make the
following changes in order to decrease the sampling distance,

VTK/Rendering/VolumeOpenGL2/vtkSmartVolumeMapper.cxx
ln. 91 -- comment
<https://gitlab.kitware.com/vtk/vtk/blob/master/Rendering/VolumeOpenGL2/vtkSmartVolumeMapper.cxx#L91>
//  this->GPUMapper->LockSampleDistanceToInputSpacingOn();

/ParaViewCore/ClientServerCore/Rendering/vtkImageVolumeRepresentation.cxx
ln. 350 -- add
<https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/blob/master/ParaViewCore/ClientServerCore/Rendering/vtkImageVolumeRepresentation.cxx#L350>
  this->VolumeMapper->SetAutoAdjustSampleDistances(0);
  this->VolumeMapper->SetInteractiveAdjustSampleDistances(0);
  const float dist = 1.0;
  this->VolumeMapper->SetSampleDistance(dist);  //<-- smaller dist for
higher quality / worse performance

This is a hack, but it should improve the rendering quality.  Be careful
however to not make 'dist'
too small as this hack has the disadvantage that the specified sampling
distance would be also
used during interaction (you might notice some performance issues).

If you are trying to increase the sampling rate in order to reduce "wood
grain" artifacts, you
could instead try enabling jittering, this might also help (without major
performance concerns),

VTK/Rendering/VolumeOpenGL2/vtkSmartVolumeMapper.cxx

ln. 92 -- add
<https://gitlab.kitware.com/vtk/vtk/blob/master/Rendering/VolumeOpenGL2/vtkSmartVolumeMapper.cxx#L92>
  this->GPUMapper->UseJitteringOn();

We are planning to expose both settings in the future so that they can be
controlled through
the UI in ParaView.

Hope that helps,
?lvaro

Hi Utkarsh,

Yes we need an off-screen rendering for the server and X11/GPU accelerated for the client.
As per the FAQ: Can ParaView be built with X11/GPU accelerated OpenGL and OSMesa in the same build?

If I build with osmesa, it seems that I must use PARAVIEW_BUILD_QT_GUI=OFF and VTK_USE_X=OFF to get a build (I'll need to re-verify, since I've tried so many combination). But this seems to preclude building for both hardware and software rendering in the same build?

I suspect this is CTest's fault. Could you see if there is a `-i` flag
in your DartConfiguration.tcl (or anywhere else in the cache) associated
with the `make` command? The fix is to pass
`-DMAKE_COMMAND:STRING=/path/to/make` to CMake during the configure,
otherwise it "helpfully" passes `-i` (act like errors don't happen)
which causes these kinds of problems. I suspect that Qt's configure is
passing things it should not be passing and then setting preprocessor
definitions it should not be.

Note that it may be helpful to use an external Qt using the
`standalone-qt` project in `superbuild/standalone-qt` so that you do not
need to build it every night (it changes infrequently enough that this
isn't too much of a hassle).

To the best of my knowledge, that's not possible, it's not possible to
have GPU accelerated OpenGL and OSMesa in the same build of ParaView.
You have to do separate builds. ParaView does support using osmesa and
libGL provided by Mesa itself in the same build, but that won't be
using GPU, in that case.

That is rather unfortunate - I guess that I misunderstood what the commits were doing.
On the bright side: at least I have a definitive statement about what works and what doesn't.

Many thanks for the quick answer.

It is legal to create an exodus file with no nodes and no elements.  If that file is part of a parallel set (using file-per-processor mode), then that ?empty? file should have consistent metadata (block counts, sideset counts, ?), but it is allowed to have zero nodes and elements.

    Yes, that is a basic assumption of the Exodus file format: each rank is assigned a subset of the cells and nodes in the simulation domain, since otherwise there is no state to store. If rank 0 of a simulation has no nodes (and thus cannot have cells either), then it should probably not participate in writing the Exodus dataset. You could create an MPI subcontroller without the rank 0 process and have the writer use that.

    I would be very wary of this.

I took that check out and am hitting a NetCDF error that the "num_nodes" dimension isn't specified. It will probably take a bit of investigating to fix this but at least you've helped me go down the correct path.

Currently what happens in ParaView is that a file for each process is written out but the file corresponding to process 0 doesn't have any grid information or field data (an example is attached). When I read this back into ParaView using the built-in server (i.e. in serial) the ExodusII reader gets the proper points and cells but no field data is read in.

The alternative would be to modify the writer to include point and cell data information and that's probably a better solution, assuming that the ExodusII format allows for that.

Subject: [Paraview] ParaviewWeb on EC2
Message-ID: <adb2a46c-fa4f-27ee-f0a0-6dae487611e7@theweak.link>

Hello!

Following up one of the previous thread on setting up
ParaviewWeb+Visualizer, I am trying to get it going on AWS EC2 with
paraview-5.2. Maybe someone already went through it and know how to
solve this little problem?

* I launched the public AMI (ami-34f3f65e) on Ubuntu-14 with paraviewweb
4.4 which seemed like a good starting point.
* I tested the visualizer on paraviewweb-4.4 and works perfectly.
* I downloaded paraviewweb-5.2 and updated the 'pv' and 'www' symlinks
under /data folder (see 'aws_data_dir' snapshot attached).
* I also updated the paths in the start.sh, apache-TEMPLATE.conf and
launcher-TEMPLATE.json files so that they reflect the correct path for
paraview-5.2 (which are bit different than paraview-4.4). By the way,
having start.sh running as a service at startup configuring properly the
TEMPLATE files with the proper DNS name is admirable (each time I look
at the doc, config files or code, I am amazed by the quality of it,
thumb up!).
* when I navigate to the EC2 DNS, the Visualizer comes up and I can
browse for data files. The files seem to successfully load but nothing
show up in the camera (see snapshot 'aws_ec2_visu'). Looking at the logs
on the machine, they don't report any error (and look similar to what I
can get locally on my machine). There is a couple of errors showing up
in the web console though (in the snapshot attached).

It looks like I am very close to make it work, I am probably missing
something obvious.
I tried the following to solve it by using my configuration on my local
machine:
1. update the apache-TEMPLATE.conf with the following rules:
RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} ^sessionId=(.*)&path=(.*)$ [NC]
RewriteRule ^/proxy.*$ ws://${session-to-port:%1}/%2 [P]

2. update the launcher-TEMPLATE.json with the following line:
"sessionURL" : "ws://DNS_NAME/proxy?sessionId=${id}&path=ws",

3. reboot (so that the files get updated)

but this time the UI doesn't even load, meaning I made it worse.

It seems just like a websocket connection issue, right?

Thanks in advance for any ideas to try.

Hi Claude,

I'm glad you like our doc and code. If you feel we are missing something
that is not obvious, please report it so we can fix it.

Regarding your issue, you had a good reflex in fixing apache and the
launcher config, as with PV5.2 we use a second ws connection for streaming
the images in binary format. But it has been forever since I setup that
ami, I have very little memory of what was setup.

I do know that we use 'sed' to dynamically replace some string so the
proper HOST for apache and the launcher get used, but I don't remember if
it was DNS_NAME or something else. But from what I understand, you've done
exactly what I would have done myself.

I'm wondering if when you edited your launcher config you managed to
produce an invalid JSON file. (You can paste it here http://jsonlint.com/
to be sure)

Moreover, seeing the network calls of the web page that don't even load
might be useful. I'd be curious to see the response of the POST on
/paraview.

Seb

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview 5.2.0: max time limit of 4095 for annotated
	.vtu file?
Message-ID: <5e518246b98c4d90a39855ea3bf421ca@exch4-cdc.nexus.csiro.au>

Upon loading an annotated .vtu file with TimeStep annotations such as this into Paraview 5.2.0 (under 64 bit SUSE Linux):

<DataArray type="Float64" Name="V" TimeStep="10560"  format="appended" RangeMin="-87.934331219"        RangeMax="-87.443353026"        offset="7801035604"          />

I see the following:

[cid:image001.png at 01D27342.72FDFF10]

such that a maximum of 4095 time steps are available, as opposed to the expected 10,560 time steps.

When the non-annotated .vtu file is loaded, the expected number of frames are visible.

Is there some inherent limitation within Paraview that prevents more than 4095 time steps from being loaded/visualised?

Thanks.

Subject: [Paraview] OSPray rendering: ERROR: VolumeMapper's Input has no
	scalar array!
Message-ID: <33e14dbc-aee1-04d4-ca2a-c9e9f7ef78fc@gmail.com>

Hi ,
I got an error message when trying to do volume rendering on the output 
of the ResampleToImage filter:

    ERROR: In
    /home/user/apps/paraview5.2.0-build/superbuild/paraview/src/VTK/Rendering/OSPRay/vtkOSPRayVolumeMapperNode.cxx,
    line 107
    vtkOSPRayVolumeMapperNode (0x68c2ad0): VolumeMapper's Input has no
    scalar array!

Here is how it happened.
First, I added a ProgrammableSource with Output DataSet Type set to 
vtkRectilinearGrid and apply something like this,

    import numpy as np

    # Read x,y,z,th from file

    xCoords = vtk.vtkDoubleArray()
    for i in x:
         xCoords.InsertNextValue(i)

    yCoords = vtk.vtkDoubleArray()
    for i in y:
         yCoords.InsertNextValue(i)

    zCoords = vtk.vtkDoubleArray()
    for i in z:
         zCoords.InsertNextValue(i)

    output.SetDimensions(len(x), len(y), len(z))
    output.SetXCoordinates(xCoords)
    output.SetYCoordinates(yCoords)
    output.SetZCoordinates(zCoords)

    thArray = vtk.vtkFloatArray()
    thArray.SetName("Temperature")
    thArray.SetNumberOfComponents(1)
    thArray.SetNumberOfTuples(nx*ny*nz)
    for k in range(nz):
         for j in range(ny):
             for i in range(nx):
                 index = i+j*nx+k*ny*nx
                 thArray.SetValue(index, th[k,j,i])
    output.GetCellData().SetScalars(thArray)
    return output

Since volume rendering can not be done on rectilinear grid. I added a 
ResampleToImage filter on this source.

Then I could do volume rendering using Ray cast or GPU based, but not 
OSPray and the above message popped up.

How to make this work? Thanks.

Hi Sebastien,

sorry to make you dig into old memories :S
so far I have been able to achieve the goals thanks to the documentation
and help. Last thing I tried was to connect the visualizer to pv server
in parallel. The help contents (--help) of bin/pvserver and the
pvw-visualizer.py helped me to figure it out (all I had to do is use
"reverse connection" and have pvserver connect to paraviewweb).

I don't think it's possible to document every single possibility and
that's where the code quality+comment and built-in help are very useful
and complete. I will let you know if I find anything but so far so
amazingly good.


Regarding the EC2 at startup (pvw-start service running /data/start.sh),
only DNS_NAME (ec2-xxxx-compute1-amazonaws.com) is fetched and replaced
in the {apache/launcher}-TEMPLATE.{conf/json} files. I didn't see any
other variable in there.

After checking with JSONLint, the launcher JSON file is indeed valid.

Paying more attention to the network requests, I don't see the failed
GET and WS switching protocol requests anymore. Even more strange, when
I move the camera, I can see the stack of black/blank frames being send
by the server (axis are not visible either).

By the way I used this config:
* apache.conf
  RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} ^sessionId=(.*)&path=(.*)$ [NC]
  RewriteRule ^/proxy.*$ ws://${session-to-port:%1}/%2 [P]

* launcher.json
  "sessionURL" : "ws://DNS_NAME/proxy?sessionId=${id}&path=ws",

As I am writing this, I just restarted the instance (terminate+launch)
instead of reboot and it is now working... I went back to see the logs
of failed remote viewing and I can now see this at the very end (after
proper launching and everything):
XIO:  fatal IO error 0 (Success) on X server ":0.0"

So here is what I am guessing:
- I messed up something in the config files yesterday as I didn't get to
that point
- rebooting the instance doesn't start X properly, which fails to render
the 3D view and explains why the frames are blank but everything else is
fine.
- somehow re-launching the instance starts X properly.

I am puzzled but also happy that it seems to be working :)
Do you know what would be the reasons for this issue with X? Since I
started from the pv AMI, I didn't have to install any drivers nor
configure the display. Maybe I'll try a fresh AMI with ubuntu-16 and
install the drivers nvidia-367 to see if I encounter similar issues with X.

Thanks for the pointers Sebastien.

cheers,
Claude

Thanks Claude for your feedback and I'm happy to ear that's working.

We haven't moved to Ubuntu 16.04 so far due to the lack of time and the
fact that services management is different.

For Ubuntu 14.04, you can use our ansible provisioning script here:
http://kitware.github.io/paraviewweb/docs/ansible.html
But as I said, it won't fully work on 16.04, but if you are up for it, you
can always fix it for 16.04 and contribute back.

Moreover, we still have some manual step for the driver as the user should
pick the right driver.

You might also find some useful information here too:
https://github.com/Kitware/paraviewweb/issues/319

Good luck,

Seb

I'm definitely up for the challenge. Thanks for referring the current
issues that will help. I am not familiar with Ansible, I'll definitely
give it a try then.

I'll try the following:
* make a public AMI for Ubuntu 16.04 - paraview-5.2
* port the Ansible book to Ubuntu 16.04

I'll keep you posted.
Thank you Sebastien!

Hi Greg,

Thanks for the info. I've briefly gone through the ExodusII Sandia report
at http://prod.sandia.gov/techlib/access-control.cgi/1992/922137.pdf but
didn't notice any information on parallel sets. Is that available some
place that I can look at?

Thanks,
Andy

Subject: [Paraview] OSPray rendering: ERROR: VolumeMapper's Input has no
 scalar array!

 That's a bug in either the OSPRay mapper or the ResampleToImage filter,
depending on your point of view. To workaround, put a python programmable
filter into the pipeline to annotate the array as being the "Active
Scalars".

In it, choose:
Output Data Set Type = "Same as Input" //the default
check "Copy Arrays" //not the default
for script use :self.GetOutput().GetPointData().SetActiveScalars("RTData")

Thank you, David.

I could not get your script to work.
Fortunately, I found another workaround.
Either change my source to provide PointData, or put a 
CellDataToPointData filter between the source and the resample filter.
Hope this is helpful for you.

Dear All,

I have been spending nearly 2 weeks to build and install a plug-in called
"Serafinreader" that can help me read TELEMAC3D output files.

Unfortunately,  I failed many times, right now it is a stressful time for
me as I don't know how to sort it out.  I attach here the error, so
hopefully someone could help me

(I think in this mailling list, there are some TELEMAC users who are also
keen on to tackle this problem with PARAVIEW).

Please help me. I really appreciate in advance!

Best Regards
HUY

There is a VTK topic now that should fix this regression. With this change
OpenGL2 LIC seems to run much faster (at least 10X).

https://gitlab.kitware.com/vtk/vtk/merge_requests/2419

Hopefully it will test out OK and get merged into VTK and then merged into
ParaView.

Subject: [Paraview] Time Source for Data Arrays
Message-ID: <CAMMVvrMi5=WXLD7DsxsLrfzCocr-eBzSfFQk5nqZ5qYckaMV0Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

in Biomedical Engineering we often work with large datasets where the
geometry doesn't change over time but the scalar values change. Therefore
we use to save the data as single geometry with many variables (data
arrays) that are named according to the time index.

It would be very convenient if ParaView could recognize these data arrays
as time index again. I am looking for the following filter:

INPUT
- Dataset with
    - one geometry
    - some individual variables (p.ex. material class)
    - and thousands of variables / scalar data arrays with consecutive
names like
         - fwd_calc_0000.000000
         - fwd_calc_0000.001000
         - fwd_calc_0000.002000
         - fwd_calc_0000.003000
- Regular expression that matches the wanted data arrays and extracts the
numeric time value

OUTPUT
- Dataset with
     - geometry
     - the individual variables
     - Time dependence according to the variables that are named fitting
for the regex

The filter itself must be possible: TimeSource creates time index data out
of nothing.
I learned about vtkFileSeriesReader, but I don't want to save each timestep
into a separate VTK file with its own geometry since the geometry stays the
same.
Such a filter would be very useful to many of us and has been awaited for a
long time.

Hi,

I tried rebuilding paraview with:   make -B -dr -j 12 > stdout.txt 2> 
stderr.txt

Unfortunately the problem still persists. The output file stderr.txt is 
attached, the other one is too large.

Philipp,

The "-dr" was a command line argument to ParaView, not for building ParaView.

Hi,

My bad :(, Yes it does work with the -dr argument. There is no 
additional output on the console.

Is there a way to make it work without the -dr argument?

You can remove old config files which seem to be causing some issues.

Hi Daniel,

The datasets that you describe are what most computational physics datasets
are like. The geometry remains fixed while the scalars on the geometry
change with time. The Ensight Gold format is one that I use often. It has
very nice support for time series data where there is just one geometry
file with a set of changing scalars on the geometry.

http://www-vis.lbl.gov/NERSC/Software/ensight/doc/OnlineHelp/UM-C11.pdf

I'm not sure exactly what you are asking for in your original question. Do
you want the Kitware guys to write a filter that can read some sort of
simulation data formatted in a specific way into Paraview? They would need
more information about the format that you are using i.e. how is the data
structured, etc.

Hope this helps,

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [Paraview] Paraview 5.2.0: max time limit of 4095 for annotated .vtu file?

Upon loading an annotated .vtu file with TimeStep annotations such as this into Paraview 5.2.0 (under 64 bit SUSE Linux):

<DataArray type="Float64" Name="V" TimeStep="10560"  format="appended" RangeMin="-87.934331219"        RangeMax="-87.443353026"        offset="7801035604"          />

I see the following:

[cid:image001.png at 01D27588.5D3DF7F0]

such that a maximum of 4095 time steps are available, as opposed to the expected 10,560 time steps.

When the non-annotated .vtu file is loaded, the expected number of frames are visible.

Is there some inherent limitation within Paraview that prevents more than 4095 time steps from being loaded/visualised?

Thanks.

David

Attached is a script that shows how this can be done using a
programmable filter. You'll need to update the "Script" and
"ScriptRequestInformation" to load your files using the right reader,
along with the logic to determine which files are to be read, this
should give you some hints.

I've also attached the mock data I used for this. You can run the
script.py from the "Python Shell" in ParaView.

to polygonal meshes or unstructured grids.

The ResampleWithDataset Filter is only applied to the current time-step 
and is not updated upon time step change. The old implementation 
LegacyResampleWithDataset still works though.

I have attached transient image data that I generated with the data 
object generator source and  a ParaView 5.2 state that demonstrates the 
problem once the time step is changed.

My Question is, did I miss something in the application of the 
reimplemented filter or is this a bug ?


Best regards

Ralf

Hi Christopher,

I was looking for a general filter that can turn a series of variables
named in a consecutive manner into one time dependent variable.

Thank you very much for your reply. I now think about using Ensight Gold
or XDMF as data format which is more modern and appropriate than VTK.

Best regards
Daniel

Hi Seb and Claude,

Thanks for your valuable inputs. I have been able to setup ParaView web on
a windows 10 system and things are working as expected.

I have created a gist (
https://gist.github.com/debopamg/aa497516d79442efa44b8e23838e1235) detailing
the process of setting up the ParaView application and use apache as the
front end server.

Thanks again for your help.


Cheers & Best Wishes,
Debopam

Hi Ralf,

This is a known bug in v5.2. There is a fix in the master branch of
ParaView if you would like to try it out.

Thanks

I'd suggest contacting the developers of the said plugin. It's not a plugin
distributed by ParaView officially. Based on the error messages, seems to
me that your file has element types not supported by the reader.

Thanks Debopam for putting it together.

If you feel that could be useful, we can move/copy your gist to the main
paraviewweb web site.

Let me know if you want me to put that information in the ParaViewWeb repo.

Thanks,

Seb

Hi Alan

Sure, will do. I have also tested a solution.

Looks like a bug.  Mind writing it up?  If you can give the developers a way to replicate the bug, it will significantly increase the chance it will be looked at...

https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/issues

Thanks,

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [Paraview] Paraview 5.2.0: max time limit of 4095 for annotated .vtu file?

Upon loading an annotated .vtu file with TimeStep annotations such as this into Paraview 5.2.0 (under 64 bit SUSE Linux):

<DataArray type="Float64" Name="V" TimeStep="10560"  format="appended" RangeMin="-87.934331219"        RangeMax="-87.443353026"        offset="7801035604"          />

I see the following:

[cid:image001.png at 01D27735.1E0C99C0]

such that a maximum of 4095 time steps are available, as opposed to the expected 10,560 time steps.

When the non-annotated .vtu file is loaded, the expected number of frames are visible.

Is there some inherent limitation within Paraview that prevents more than 4095 time steps from being loaded/visualised?

Thanks.

David

Subject: [Paraview] XDMF crash
Message-ID: <CAMMVvrNnPi6vu+P-p9Y3kP65sYZ_DXHg=URLn8TRBdpEaKsoTQ@mail.gmail.com>

I generated the following XDMF file and tried to open it in ParaView. When
I open it, I get a dialog with three readers to choose:
- XDMF reader
- XDMF3 reader
- XDMF3 reader (Top Level Partition)

I can open the file with "XDMF reader", but when I open it with the other
two readers, ParaView (5.1.0 64-bit Mac) crashes.

Application Specific Information:
terminating with uncaught exception of type XdmfError: 'Value' not in
itemProperties in XdmfTime::populateItem
abort() called

But I generated the file according to this recommendation
<http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Data_formats#Reading_a_time_varying_Raw_file_into_Paraview>
and
according to the XDMF3 <http://www.xdmf.org/index.php/XDMF_Model_and_Format>
standard. When I try to open this public example
<http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Data_formats#Reading_a_time_varying_Raw_file_into_Paraview>
with XDMF3 in ParaView, it crashes, too.


Now this is the content of my XDMF file:

This is because the Xdmf3 reader does not support the Hyperslab Timetype. One Time item per grid is the preferred method.

I have examined Utkarsh's example because it is similar to one of my projects. Thanks.

Yet, I am sorry to say I cannot execute it cleanly, without a small edit.

I run PV 5.2.
I execute script.py from the Python Shell. An image of the can is displayed, yet what is not working is that the Information Tab has an empty set of Timestep index, and Timestep Value. Consequently, the VCR Play button will go thru timestep values = 0, 0.111, 0.222, 0.333, 0.444 etc....

My work-around is to go back to the ProgrammableSource and force re-execution manually, by simply deleting the first empty line of "Script" and forcing re-execution.

This is more than an aesthetic problem. This prevents the correct execution of time-dependent programmable sources in BATCH mode. I have yet to manage to get my time-aware analysis working.

Do you not run into the same problem?

Message-ID: <CAFgDerEGgRHAHD=yxTf2-QkaevtX20JgQ8QzQvgbhvkm5PLUOQ@mail.gmail.com>

I would like to build and make available a pre-compiled windows binary for
a filter I have developed. I would like to avoid the (windows) user having
to compile the filter as well as paraview. Therefore I am wondering what
compiler is used to produce the official Paraview builds so-as to avoid ABI
issues with my pre-compiled .dll. Is there anything else I need to be aware
of?

Thanks, Chris

Looks like a bug.  Mind writing it up?  If you can give the developers a way to replicate the bug, it will significantly increase the chance it will be looked at...

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [Paraview] Paraview 5.2.0: max time limit of 4095 for annotated .vtu file?

Upon loading an annotated .vtu file with TimeStep annotations such as this into Paraview 5.2.0 (under 64 bit SUSE Linux):

<DataArray type="Float64" Name="V" TimeStep="10560"  format="appended" RangeMin="-87.934331219"        RangeMax="-87.443353026"        offset="7801035604"          />

I see the following:

[cid:image001.png at 01D276FA.43DFFCE0]

such that a maximum of 4095 time steps are available, as opposed to the expected 10,560 time steps.

When the non-annotated .vtu file is loaded, the expected number of frames are visible.

Is there some inherent limitation within Paraview that prevents more than 4095 time steps from being loaded/visualised?

Thanks.

Hello Mr. Burns, thank you very much for your helpful answer. I changed the
XDMF file. But now I have another question.

Now I have problems with GridType="SubSet". ParaView doesn't view the
second and third timestep. Their grids are referenced as SubSet from the
first grid.

This is the reason why I am doing all this: I want ParaView change the
color on a static, fixed, large geometry as quickly as if I switched the
surface coloring variable in the Active Variables Controls dropdown, but
using the time playback features. It is very inconvenient to change the
"timestep" by selecting an other variable in a Color Map drop-down menu
with thousands of entries. Is this even possible in ParaView?

From my understanding of your method, you want to use the progression of "time" to iterate across attribute displays?

You don't need GridType="Subset" for that (and I don't think Xdmf3 uses that designation anyway). Just use XPointers to point the grids to the topology and geometry of the first one.

________________________________



Hello Mr. Burns, thank you very much for your helpful answer. I changed the XDMF file. But now I have another question. 

Now I have problems with GridType="SubSet". ParaView doesn't view the second and third timestep. Their grids are referenced as SubSet from the first grid. 

This is the reason why I am doing all this: I want ParaView change the color on a static, fixed, large geometry as quickly as if I switched the surface coloring variable in the Active Variables Controls dropdown, but using the time playback features. It is very inconvenient to change the "timestep" by selecting an other variable in a Color Map drop-down menu with thousands of entries. Is this even possible in ParaView?

	This is because the Xdmf3 reader does not support the Hyperslab Timetype. One Time item per grid is the preferred method.

We use Visual Studio 2013 Community to build the binaries from the
superbuild:

    https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview-superbuild

If you want to be compatible with the paraview.org downloads, there are
two packages built, one with MPI and one without. You can see the
command lines used to build the superbuild here:

    https://open.cdash.org/viewConfigure.php?buildid=4740356 (no MPI)
    https://open.cdash.org/viewConfigure.php?buildid=4740247 (with MPI)

Only MSMPI is supported (but cannot be redistributed, so we rely on it
being available on the target machine already).

If you want to build your own package with the plugin pre-packaged, you
can use the documentation here:

    https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview-superbuild/#external-plugins

to support building your plugin and then extract it from the install/
tree and distribute it to your users. We currently do not ship an SDK
for Windows, so it is easiest to build 5.2.0 locally and then
redistribute your plugin (though building your own package is also
easy). Note that your plugin is built as part of ParaView in this
configuration, so there is no need to do a `find_package(ParaView)`. You
can see how the PointSpritePlugin deals with this here:

    https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/blob/4897676d1cdc764f933a9fac22149dadf6dd5cb2/Plugins/PointSprite/CMakeLists.txt#L14

I already tried XPath pointers, but it takes a few seconds in ParaView when
I click to the next time frame ---
whereas it takes only 0.1s to change the color when I switch the Active
Variable for the ColorMap in ParaView's dropdown.
I thought using SubSet, ParaView might "recognize" that it is actually all
the same geometry.
But meanwhile I assume ParaView always thinks the geometry might change
between timeframes
and takes much time for switching between timeframes no matter what file
format I use.

The load time is because Paraview needs a moment to load the data for the new timestep in. When you switch variables all the data is in memory already.

This is done because Paraview is designed to work with large datasets. For higher scale implementations it wouldn't be feasible to have all grids loaded in memory simultaneously.

From my knowledge, Paraview actually does check if the geometry is reused and doesn't reload it if that is the case. However, it still needs to do some conversions behind the scenes when it loads a timestep.

I already tried XPath pointers, but it takes a few seconds in ParaView when I click to the next time frame --- whereas it takes only 0.1s to change the color when I switch the Active Variable for the ColorMap in ParaView's dropdown. 
I thought using SubSet, ParaView might "recognize" that it is actually all the same geometry. 
But meanwhile I assume ParaView always thinks the geometry might change between timeframes and takes much time for switching between timeframes no matter what file format I use.

	From my understanding of your method, you want to use the progression of "time" to iterate across attribute displays?
	
	You don't need GridType="Subset" for that (and I don't think Xdmf3 uses that designation anyway). Just use XPointers to point the grids to the topology and geometry of the first one.

	Hello Mr. Burns, thank you very much for your helpful answer. I changed the XDMF file. But now I have another question.
	
	Now I have problems with GridType="SubSet". ParaView doesn't view the second and third timestep. Their grids are referenced as SubSet from the first grid.
	
	This is the reason why I am doing all this: I want ParaView change the color on a static, fixed, large geometry as quickly as if I switched the surface coloring variable in the Active Variables Controls dropdown, but using the time playback features. It is very inconvenient to change the "timestep" by selecting an other variable in a Color Map drop-down menu with thousands of entries. Is this even possible in ParaView?

Message-ID: <1089006118.352109.1485436158604@com4.strato.de>

Dear ParaView!

I have a simulation computed with a finite volume method which outputs
pressure as cell data. The pressure gradient is related to the velocity
(Darcy's law). Is it possible to calculate the gradient as a finite
difference between the cell centers of adjacent cells?
The result would be located between the cells, not sure whether this
works at all.

Converting cell data to point data and using the gradient filter is not
what I want.

Hi,

I set up my environment as indicated in

Is there a way to pass a dynamic data dir to python launcher from
visualizer client?

I would like to enter in the browser
http://myaddres/visualizer?dataDir=[my_data_dir] and pvw-visualizer.py be
started by launcher with [my_data_dir] in data parameter value.

If it is not possible to do as I said, is there any other way that I can
dynamically configure the data dir?

cheers,

dear experts,
I need to compile the Paraview 5.01 for CentOS 5.11/ gcc 4.1.2 (x64).
Unfortunately the CMake claims that GCC 4.2 or greater is required. I can
of course edit the CMake files and release this constraint.
But before going further, I am wondering whether someone on this mailing
list did already manage to compile Paraview with gcc 4.1.
My final goal being to compile h5py+Paraview....
In advance, thanks for your valuable help.

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview Live Visualisation C++ Pipeline
Message-ID: <b2c04a5a491d49bd83c2aa0ab28ab5c5@BADWLRZ-SWMBX02.ads.mwn.de>

Hi,

for a University Project we're trying to run Paraview Live Simulation on the local cluster-network. Unfortunately the network only has a Paraview version without python-binding installed, therefore we would like to run the LiveSimulation with a C++-coded Pipeline Skript.

As far as we understood, to make it work we have to rewrite the following lines from the PythonPipeline Script to C++, which turns out to be quite challenging:

coprocessor.UpdateProducers(datadescription)
# Write output data, if appropriate.
coprocessor.WriteData(datadescription);
# Live Visualization, if enabled.
coprocessor.DoLiveVisualization(datadescription, "localhost", 22222)

We tried the following:

//INITIALIZE
vtkNew<vtkLiveInsituLink> link;
vtkSMProxyManager* proxyManager;
vtkSMSessionProxyManager* sessionProxyManager;
link -> SetInsituPort(22222);
link -> SetHostname("localhost");
proxyManager = vtkSMProxyManager::GetProxyManager();
sessionProxyManager = proxyManager->GetActiveSessionProxyManager();
link -> Initialize(sessionProxyManager);

// Initialize returns 1, therefore connection established properly

//Then we tried to coprocess with the following code:
vtkNew<vtkXMLPImageDataWriter> writer;
writer->SetInputConnection(producer->GetOutputPort());
vtkSMProxy* proxy = sessionProxyManager->NewProxy("insitu_writer_parameters","XMLPImageDataWriter");
vtkSMInputProperty* property = (vtkSMInputProperty*) proxy -> GetProperty("Input");

//set input of proxy to our writer or datadescription - DOESN'T WORK
while(true){
  link->InsituUpdate(dataDescription->GetTime(), dataDescription->GetTimeStep());
  //update pipeline
  link->InsituPostProcess(dataDescription->GetTime(), dataDescription->GetTimeStep());
  if(link->GetSimulationPaused()){
    if(link->WaitForLiveChange()){
      break;
    }
  } else{
    break;
}
  }

So how are we supposed to get the data from our simulation into the Proxy?
We have been trying and searching the documentation for the right functions, but we can't figure out how to do it.

We would really appreciate some help ;-)

Best regards,
Simon Kohlhase

Hi,

Currently the Live functionality only works when ParaView is built with
Python bindings. My suggestion would be to build ParaView yourself. That
should be much easier than trying to put in a C++ pipeline that can deal
with the Live functionality properly.

As for building ParaView, you may want to look into using the ParaView
Superbuild (https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview-superbuild/) which
will also build all needed dependencies. The dependencies are probably all
there though since you've said that ParaView is already installed there.

I'm not sure the set up you're looking for but if you want to run with the
simulation+Catalyst linking to a parallel pvserver on the cluster which
then connects to a client, you may want to use ParaView master. The reason
for this is that there was a bug that had all of the simulation+Catalyst
nodes only being able to communicate with a single pvserver node (multiple
pvserver processes though). If you only want to connect the
simulation+Catalyst to the GUI client or pvserver processes on a single
node then 5.2 should work fine for you.

Best,
Andy

Christoph,

To my knowledge, there is no direct way to do this. If your data are in an ImageData or some other type of structured grid, it should be fairly straightforward to use a programmable filter to build a new grid with one fewer point in each dimension and then copy the cell data of this original mesh to the point data of the new mesh. You can then do finite differences on the points of the new mesh and get the result you are looking for.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [Paraview] Gradient between cell data

Dear ParaView!

I have a simulation computed with a finite volume method which outputs pressure as cell data. The pressure gradient is related to the velocity (Darcy's law). Is it possible to calculate the gradient as a finite difference between the cell centers of adjacent cells?
The result would be located between the cells, not sure whether this works at all.

Converting cell data to point data and using the gradient filter is not what I want.

Bye
Christoph

Hi,

The gradient of unstructured data sets will work on cell data. Have you
tried that?

Note though that ParaView/VTK only allows fields to be associated with
either points or cells, not interfaces between cells (e.g. faces in 3D and
edges in 2D).

Hi Any,
I did not try to apply the gradient of unstructured data to a set of
structured data. Thank you for the hint, this was exactly the filter
I was looking for!

Christoph,

Do you want the pressure gradient?

Do you want the velocity gradient?

Do you want the energy flux through a cell facet(face)?

What is the geometry of your mesh cells?

Maybe I can help if I had the information like the above.

Nabil,
Can you use gcc 4.4?  It should be available on EL5 as a technology preview
by installing the gcc44{,-c++,-gfortran} packages.  You'll then need to set
your CC and CXX env vars to /usr/bin/gcc44 and /usr/bin/g++44 respectively.

Message-ID: <fc5984cc675249b9a99322f55471a36d@ES08AMSNLNT.srn.sandia.gov>

Be aware that the gradient of unstructured data will internally run the cell data to point data filter if you take the gradient of cell data. You said in your first email that you didn't want to convert the cell data to point data, so this might not give you the result you want.

Hi Any,
I did not try to apply the gradient of unstructured data to a set of structured data. Thank you for the hint, this was exactly the filter I was looking for!

Message-ID: <alpine.LRH.2.20.1701230928120.101132@tempest.math.colostate.edu>


Dear all,

I am wondering whether it is possible to color a unstructured 
triangulated 3D surface using the scalar field stored in another
file with structured 3D grid. I can manually interpolate the
data on surface mesh from the 3D structured grid but thought that
paraview might have some proper filters for this purpose.

Thank you!

 summary for a subset of model
Message-ID: <SN2PR0701MB7845FE5F06E77F0CECC995C9F770@SN2PR0701MB784.namprd07.prod.outlook.com>

All,

Sometimes it is helpful to take a subset of a real world problem and create a lab specimen of that subset and subject it to realistic loadings in order to replicate the real world problem.     Many times we have tried to cut an internal chunk out of a solid mechanics FEA model and determine an appropriate loading to be applied to it in the test lab.

What general procedures would be used in Paraview in order to get these type of (time-varying) loads on the external surfaces of an extracted subset?    I hope I'm not too obscure for anyone to know what I'm asking.

Thanks for any ideas.

Dennis

Hi,
I would like to add the "1" button from the "Adjust Camera" dialog to the main GUI toolbar.
At the end it would allow to reset the camera view with a single click to my favourite viewpoint.
Is this possible?
If yes, how?
If not, what would be a simple workaround to get such a behaviour?

Message-ID: <1634417592.25736612.1485704019750@mail.yahoo.com>

I want to plot a tabulated fonction (say F=cos(t)) using paraview which reads the values of t and F from a csv file then the plot F-t is generated by the "Plot Data" filter. t takes values in the [-1,+1] range.The problem is:    
   - "Left Range Axis Maximum" can hold negative and positive values.
   - "Left Range Axis Minimum" can not hold only negative values or zero.
Thi results in: negative values of the function are not plotted.The only solution I found is to get a plot of the reverse function (-F) by setting "Left Range Axis Maximum" to a (-1) and "Left Range Axis Minimum" to (+1) which is very strange (Maximum < Minimum). The csv data and the plot are in the attached files.? 
So please is there a solution to this problem or is this a bug in paraview?Nota: I get this with paraview 4.4.0 and 5.2 versions on Centos 7.

Thank you Utkarsh AyachitAfter your reply, I found the origin of my problem.In a previous run, I used a semilog plot by enabling "Left Axis Log Scale" and saved the setting as default one. Paraview saves the setting in the file : $HOME/.config/ParaView/ParaView-UserSettings.json
 In the following runs, "Left Axis Log Scale" is enabled by default and ParaView do not accept negative values for "Left Axis Range Minimum" even if I disable? "Left Axis Log Scale".
To solve the problem, I disable "Left Axis Log Scale", save the settings and restart ParaView. (If I do not restart, I still in the same situation until next run). The changes do not take effect in the current session.
So, I this is not a normal behaviour, it can be a bug.
Best regards.

Ah! Yes, we have  been discussing offline that the "saving property
values to settings", which is nifty feature, can sometimes cause
confusion since it's not clear what has been modified from default and
it's easy to forget. Something to mull over. We probably need to think
about finer control over what gets saved to settings and then
indication in the UI of what is affected by local settings -- or
something along those lines.

I see that restarting the application to make the new settings taking effect is disturbing since this does not happen in all cases. In what I have tested, this only happen when the saved setting view have LeftAxisRangeMinimum strictly positive? (not zero) with LeftAxisLogScale enabled.
Now, if I have to give suggestions:??? - This case has be explored, perhaps patched.
??? - Give to the user the possibility to save the settings in his his workspace, in different names, not as default. In this manner, one can try severall settings on the same plot and do not alter other projects.

 Ah! Yes, we have? been discussing offline that the "saving property
values to settings", which is nifty feature, can sometimes cause
confusion since it's not clear what has been modified from default and
it's easy to forget. Something to mull over. We probably need to think
about finer control over what gets saved to settings and then
indication in the UI of what is affected by local settings -- or
something along those lines.

Subject: [Paraview] Writer plugin with selection of data arrays to output
Message-ID: <CAHjnjh7+AYTeMp_5Zu5OKw5qppXn-BVKSsUGTMk9GY3sNSEg0Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am trying to implement a sink algorithm (writer) to output point clouds
in my custom format. The points may have multiple data
arrays, and the writer should provide the user with an option to select
which of these arrays are to be output.

Unfortunately, I am not able to find any wiki pages or articles that
explain how to implement such a writer. Also, I do not find any
existing writers with this functionality. The most similar things I found
are:

1) AMR base particles reader
<http://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkAMRBaseParticlesReader.html>.
It provides a facility to select which data arrays are to be read from a
file. Basically, when the user
sets the filename, the reader loads the meta-information about available
arrays from the file, and then these are displayed in
ParaView properties panel. The user can tick the arrays he wants and press
"Apply" to read. I can not figure out how to apply this
in my writer, because the only extension point for writers is the
WriteData() function. It is called after the user has pressed the
"Save" button, which is too late. In fact, I want to "inject" some code
between the moment the user chose the output filename (and
hence the writer to use), and the moment a dialog window with the
properties of the writer is shown.

2) Wiki page on writing readers
<http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Plugin_HowTo#Drop_down_list_with_values_from_input_arrays>.
There is an example how make a drop-down list to select which input array
to process. Perhaps
I could add this to the writer, however it does seem to support only a
single array choice, whereas I need multiple.

I would be very grateful for suggestions on how to implement the
functionality I need. Examples of existing readers would be
great. Or if there is definitely no "official" clean way to implement this,
please also let me know.

Cheers,
Sergey

Hi Sergey,

I'm not aware of another writer that has the behavior you describe of
saving out specified data arrays. As a result, there isn't any
existing code to select the data arrays to be saved. There are a
number of readers that do support which arrays to load, but it's not
really possible to reuse that infrastructure without some additional
ParaView development work to support selecting arrays to be written.

A workaround would be to use a Pass Data Arrays filter to select the
data arrays, then save the Pass Data Arrays output to your custom
writer.

Hope that helps,
Cory

Message-ID: <CAKYeY9u4rL+LtkcFTZqNGEQ8nsJgmAM7-URSFumGaQvtKGz+og@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm rather new to Paraview. I'm inspecting the output of x3D from a  scene
that contains a couple of blocks, colored according to vtkBlockColors. But
as I inspect the output, I see



>  <IndexedFaceSet solid="false" colorPerVertex="true"
> normalPerVertex="true" coordIndex="
>             0 1 2 -1
>             3 4 1 -1
>             3 1 0 -1
>             blah, blah




All "-1" --- and no colors are described!!!

Are there any workarounds?? Would exporting to another format work.?

I'm trying to just embed a 3D object in an html page (after a little
paraview pipeline slicing and dicing) -- X3DOM seemed the easiest way to
go.

The object is a grouped one -- composed of individual meshes.

using 5.1.2,

thanks

Sergey,

You could combine the PassArrays filter and your custom writer into a Custom Filter and then Expose the properties of Cell Data Arrays and Point Data Arrays from the PassArray filter within your Custom Filter.

This would allow your users to select which arrays to pass and write them out - I think this would do exactly what you want, but you should test it.

Alan,

As you might imagine, there are a number of ways to do this. Probably
the easiest way is to apply the Point Volume Interpolator filter to
the point source. You can change the interpolator Kernel to change how
the points are sampled onto the image grid.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

- Cory

	X3D ?
Message-ID: <CAKYeY9uNBhumdqFQJzqS4Z_9Fi1voQoJEbTpHW-kVWFh71GGOg@mail.gmail.com>

Found a solution!

It turns out that "Group Datasets" defines a family of partial inverses
called "Extract Block". ("block" = "dataset"???).

Each processed dataset that emerges from the pipeline operating on the
group can be recovered by such an inverse.

The normals are lost in the process, but "Generate Surface Normals" on the
output of each inverse fixes that. And in this step, the display color can
be defined as a "Solid Color" per block/dataset.

The exported 3D output now displays correctly within a browser using the
<inline> tag of <x3d>.

Hello, I want to

- open an unstructured grid,
- view a sub-volume using the Threshold filter that selects a certain
material
- apply some Clip filters to remove unwanted parts
- select everything I am seeing now
- and create an "Extract Selection" filter that can be used for other vtk
files containing the same unstructured grid but other data arrays.

But the "GenerateIDs" filter removes the material array from the dataset so
I can't apply the Threshold filter anymore. I see the "Extract Selection"
works only with the current IDs anyway that are different from the original
cell IDs due to the Clip filters.

How can I have a filter that extracts a certain set of cells that I define
and apply it to other .vtk files?
Thank you very much in advance,
Daniel

Hi Dennis,

Thanks for the suggestion! Honestly, at first I was skeptical about your
advice because it looked very
similar to my first solution that I outlined in the beginning of this
thread. However, as soon as I examined
the XML code for the PassArrays filter, I realized that this is exactly
what I need. It uses some built-in
ParaView magic to fill the list with data array names, so there is no need
for me to "inject" my custom
code to populate it. Neat!

Thanks again!

Cheers,
Sergey

Hi all,
I?m using: Paraview 5.2.0-RC1 , 64 bit.
All fields data are being read but not displayed, that is, fields displayed in only one color.When I use find data function, I can see the data.This happens only with: velocity & pressure.

Is it a bug or VTK has been corrupted or something else ?
Thanks in advance.

Daniel,

As you have discovered, trying to ?connect? data sets in this way after the clip filter is applied is problematic because it changes the locations of points and the structure of cells. It makes the grids no longer isomorphic or sub-isomorphic.

I would suggest one of two approaches. The first approach would be to combine all the data arrays into one data set before doing any of the extractions, thresholds, or clips. If all your arrays are on data sets with the exact same grid structure, then you can use the append attributes filter to combine the arrays of all these data sets into a single data set. Then the arrays will simply be available from the output of the clip.

If that approach will not work for some reason, a second approach is to use the resample with dataset filter. You can use this to sample the other data sets onto the clipped data set, which I think in the end gives you the effect you are looking for.

-Ken

The most direct approach is probably to use the Gaussian Resampling filter.

Another approach is to run the Delaunay 3D filter and then run the resample to image filter.

Can you share your data set? It will be difficult to diagnose without that
information.

Also, I'd strongly suggest upgrading to ParaView 5.2 instead of just the
release candidate.

Hi Anxo,

I believe that Ansys supports the export of the solution(geometry and
results) to the EnSight format. Paraview can read the EnSight Gold format.
You may want to try to get ANSYS to export to EnSight and see if it works.

The ParaView Catalyst Users Guide at

Thanks Alan.

Joachim Pouderoux replied shortly before you did, asking if I was willing to create a merge request and also noting that since this is a VTK related issue, it should be reported to the VTK tracker instead.

I'm happy to create a merge request (I'm assuming we're talking about a GitHub/Bitbucket style git pull request), but should we instead be doing this via the VTK gitlab rather than Paraview as Joachim mentions?

Alan, Joachim: please feel free to let me know what procedure to follow and I'll go with that.

Thanks.

Upon loading an annotated .vtu file with TimeStep annotations such as this into Paraview 5.2.0 (under 64 bit SUSE Linux):

<DataArray type="Float64" Name="V" TimeStep="10560"  format="appended" RangeMin="-87.934331219"        RangeMax="-87.443353026"        offset="7801035604"          />

I see the following:

such that a maximum of 4095 time steps are available, as opposed to the expected 10,560 time steps.

When the non-annotated .vtu file is loaded, the expected number of frames are visible.

Is there some inherent limitation within Paraview that prevents more than 4095 time steps from being loaded/visualised?

Thanks.

David
