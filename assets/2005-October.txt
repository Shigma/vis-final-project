Subject: [Paraview] Bug with tube filter
Message-ID: <000c01c5c7f2$b2a2e480$41c809c0@jupiter>

Hello all,

I have a problem in Paraview 2.2.1 on PC with windows XP SP2. (I reproduce the problem on the previous versions)
I load a vtk file.
I select glyph filter, I choose glyph option : line0
On the glyph I apply tube filter and I have an error :
"There was a VTK Error in file : C:\devel\paraview_2.2.1\Paraview\VTK\Filtering\vtkPolyLine.cxx (102)"
"Coincident points in polyline .. can't compute normals"
"There was a VTK Warning in file : C:\devel\paraview_2.2.1\Paraview\VTK\Graphics\vtkTubeFilter.cxx (217)"
"Could not generate normals for line. Skipping to next"
These four lines are repeated with beep until I reboot my PC.

This problem comes on all vtk files I try.

Thank for your support

Best regards,

Subject: [Paraview] Ghost cells
Message-ID: <6.2.1.2.2.20051004091513.02ca4d60@pop.mcs.anl.gov>


It looks as though VTK creates ghost cells for its own use, under the hood, when it needs to.

My PARAMESH AMR data often contains ghost cells.  It doesn't look like paraview & VTK support either
1)  user loading of ghost cells, or
2)  the use of ghost cells to, e.g., properly convert cell-centered to point-centered data (isosurfaces of my cell-centered AMR data, converted to point-centered for contouring, are discontinuous at block boundaries).

Are those two points correct?


Thanks.

Hi

I am not sure, if it is better posted here or in the itk mailinglist, because it mingels both. So please don't mind if it's ill posted.

I have generated itk images with itk::vector as pixel type (as e.g. produced by itk::fem::FEMRegistrationFilter::GetDeformationField())

Afterwards I have saved this deformation fields as a meta image (*.mhd). For saving the image I used the same code snippets like in chapter 7.8 of the itkSoftwareGuide 2.2.0.

When I load this meta image (2D image with 2D vectors) into ParaView, it shows the norm of vectors. The components of the vector seems to be available and correct, because in the "Edit Color Map" menu it has been recognized as vector and I can choose to show single components of the vector instate of the norm.

Now I want to visualize the vectors with a glyph filter. When I add the glyph filter directly to the reader, the only available orient mode is "Off", "Vector" is disabled and for "Scale Mode" there is only "Data Scaling Off" available. As a result of this, I only have unsigned glyphs instate of glyphs showing the deformation field.

The information given in a post with a similar topic (http://public.kitware.com/pipermail/paraview/2004-February/000478.html) didn't helped me, because I think I did everything as explained, but wasn't able to properly setup the glyph filter.

I would be very thankful, if anybody could give me a clue what I did wrong.

The header of a sample meta image is:
ObjectType = Image
NDims = 2
BinaryData = True
BinaryDataByteOrderMSB = False
TransformMatrix = 1 0 0 1
Offset = 0 0
CenterOfRotation = 0 0
ElementSpacing = 1 1
DimSize = 20 20
AnatomicalOrientation = ??
ElementNumberOfChannels = 2
ElementType = MET_DOUBLE
ElementDataFile = sample.raw

Subject: [Paraview] Do Clip and Tetrahedralize Have A Bug in 2.2.1?
Message-ID: <460BBEB6E0DD9D25E6E77326@localhost.localdomain>

Does the tetrahedralize filter have problems with curvilinear grids?

Contours were drawn using the ParaView tutorial data file "bluntfin.vts"; 
then again after using the tetrahedralize filter; then again after running 
the input data through the clip filter (using the box function and with 
InsideOut on). The image is at

   http://www.psc.edu/~eschenbe/contours3.jpg

I am just guessing but it seems that clip converts ints output to 
tetrahedrons in this case.

I would have expected the plots from clip and tetrahedralize would be the 
same. And I had thought that they would both look like the plot using the 
original data.

Comments?

I would like to use unsigned char values which are directly mapped to
colors. I've created this vtk file that contains 25 points and each
point has his own color specified with COLOR_SCALARS. If I read this
file in ParaView2.2  the colors assigned to the points are wrong. The
results look good when I use another vtk package (MayaVi). Is that a bug
in ParaView or I am doing something wrong ? Any help will be
appreciated,

I don't think you need to know the VTK file format. Just read the file into 
ParaView (it has a plot3d reader) and then immediately use File->Write Data 
to write it to a new file in one of the VTK formats.

ParaView comes with a plot3d reader and a VTK data format writer.  Load
your plot3d into ParaView and then save the data in any format you
choose.

What exactly is your problem?

This discussion could go on for quite a while...
Largely it depends on your needs. I would say MayaVi is:
- easy to use
- easy to get nice visualizations that look good
- easy to modify/extend
- easy to script
but - it is serial and is written in a python (though the modules that 
do the real work are still c++) rather than a compiled language. This 
does give problems for large datasets.
Paraview of the other hand has a more sophisticated user interface and 
requires greater investment if modifications are required. However the 
most outstanding feature of paraview if that it has parallel support. 
This is very often the difference between being able to visualize your 
data and not.

But - the learning curve for either one is not so great so the best 
thing to do really is try both and see which suites your needs best. 
Personally I use both.

Cheers

In July (see below), I changed all references in my custom GUI from vtkKWLabeledFrame to vtkKWFrameWithLabel so I could work with the 07/11 development release of paraview.

Now, in paraview 2.2.1, vtkKWFrameWithLabel seems to've gone away.

The only class I can find there whose name contains "Frame" and "Label" is vtkKWFrameLabeled.

Is that taking over for the until-all-too-recently-vibrant vtkKWFrameWithLabel?

 From what I understand, you wrote your code for a specific PV 
branch, then adapted it to the CVS, then tried to adapt it to another 
branch back in time... Ooops, bad luck here, I think the branch was 
cut right in a very temporary renaming....

 From what I remember, it went from vtkKWLabeledFrame, to (very 
shortly) vtkKWFrameLabeled (at which point I was told it sounded too 
french), to the final vtkKWFrameWithLabel (some time ago). I guess 
2.2.1 was cut at the vtkKWFrameLabeled period :(. The CVS is and will 
remain vtkKWFrameWithLabel.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

vtkKWLabeledFrame was changed to vtkKWFrameLabeled in March of this 
year. The ParaView 2.2 CVS branch was cut near the end of June. 
vtkKWFrameLabeled was changed to vtkKWFrameWithLabel in July (after 
the CVS branch was cut for ParaView 2.2).  In the next major release 
of ParaView, vtkKWFrameWithLabel will be used since that's the name 
in use in the main CVS tree.

Message-ID: <BAY103-F16C1DAE93C497FD99D8969DE840@phx.gbl>

Is there anyway just using Paraview (not with Chromium) that I could run 
Paraview on a CAVE like passive stereo system?

We have a 3 walled system (30 degrees different).  Each wall has 2 projects 
(one for each eye) and one pc drives 1 projector.  total of 6 pcs for the 3 
walls and 1 as a controller.  I want to using paraview only render our 
dataset on the 3 screens.

Thanks in advance.

Subject: [Paraview] Bug with tube filter
Message-ID: <00d201c5cdb7$cfa82660$41c809c0@jupiter>

Hello all,

Have you take in account my last email about problem with tube filter?

I have a problem in Paraview 2.2.1 on PC with windows XP SP2. (I reproduce the problem on the previous versions)
I load a vtk file.
I select glyph filter, I choose glyph option : line0
On the glyph I apply tube filter and I have an error :
"There was a VTK Error in file : C:\devel\paraview_2.2.1\Paraview\VTK\Filtering\vtkPolyLine.cxx (102)"
"Coincident points in polyline .. can't compute normals"
"There was a VTK Warning in file : C:\devel\paraview_2.2.1\Paraview\VTK\Graphics\vtkTubeFilter.cxx (217)"
"Could not generate normals for line. Skipping to next"
These four lines are repeated with beep until I reboot my PC.

This problem comes on all vtk files I try.

Thanks for your support

Best regards,

The VTK docs for vtkTubeFilter give an explicit warning that there
should be no duplicate points.  The glyph filter may create them.  Does
Paraview have easy access to vtkCleanPolyData ?

Wow, so like every point is duped?

Subject: [Paraview] Contours
Message-ID: <6.2.1.2.2.20051010194651.02d4aa78@pop.mcs.anl.gov>


In paraview 2.0.0, my custom paraview GUI produces isosurfaces by calling certain functions, such as "AcceptCallback", in the default interface of the contour filter.

When I started using the paraview development release I had downloaded on July 11, the widget in my GUI quit working that sets the scalar variable by which to color the isosurface.  So, I started fiddling with the default contour widgets and learned that I have to slide the isovalue slider back and forth a couple times before I click "Accept" to force an isosurface to be created.  It doesn't work if I just instantiate the filter, add the default value with the "Add" button, and click "Accept".

I'm thinking the cause of this failure might be the cause of the failure of my colormap widget.

Does anyone know about this odd behavior of the contour widget and how I might get around it?

Thanks.

All is Ok if I use Clean filter between glyph and tube.
Have you an idea to avoid or (better) to correct this path ?
Because to have to reboot a PC is very unconfortable !

Hi All,

I've been getting some problems when reading the Ensight server-of-server
file shown below in Paraview 2.2.1. I think Paraview has not recognized the
identifier "master_server ensight6", so would like to know if Paraview is
capable to read SOS files that point to Ensight standard cases (NOT GOLD).

I've already tested my case files individually and they're working fine.

I haven't tested it but it is possible that reading of .sos files is
broken in 2.2. We have fixed it since then and it should work in 2.4
once released. You can try the development version from CVS.

Nope. vtk3DSImporter could be used but adding it is not as
straightforward as adding a reader. It is an importer and would have
to be wrapped by another class that behaves like a reader.

A few things:

* ParaView caching geometry when generating animations. Some of your
works sounds similar and it might be a good idea to merge the two
efforts. Take a look at vtkPVUpdateSuppressor.

* This sort of time support is being discussed, specially by Sandia
developers. I believe there will be some discussion at Vis '05 VTK
BOF.

* The new pipeline is great to do things like this. The composite
pipeline is a good example of how the execution model can be modified
by sub-classing the existing pipeline objects.

* The multi-block datasets are a good way of storing multiple
timesteps. Specially for filters that might require multiple steps
(streaklines, particle paths, any integration filter, histograms)

I loaded the data and it looks weird. It is possible to get a visible
representation by changing the display mode to "Wireframe of Surface".
Are you sure the data is correct?

Hello,

I'm wondering if there is any plan to enhance the XY plot module of paraview 
to have someting more powerfull for this kind of plot. 

Paraview is a wonderfull tool but I think it laks some features when you want 
to do XY plot.

Hello all,
I am have problems reading binary VTK data (UNSTRUCTURED_GRID) with
paraview 2.2.1 (build from source on an Apple G5 running Debian Linux).
Loading the data-file, paraview responds with an unmotivated 
"Segmentation fault".
However, I can read the same binary data with version 1.8.5 and I can 
read the
same data as ASCII with 2.2.1 as well.
Does anyone has an idea what's going wrong here?

Cheers, Michael

Hi,

Can you share some specific ideas about how to make the XY plot better? 
Ideas about how to make ParaView better are always appreciated.

I have two improvements that I want to put in. The first is to make the 
time axis for temporal plotting correspond to the time step of the 
reader when one is available. The second is to clean up the existing 
probe and pick plotting code to make them easier to maintain and to make 
batch, trace, and state playback fully functional for testing. Other 
than these two I don't have any plans for it.

cheers,
Dave DeMarle

Improved 2D data support (including plots) is a medium to long term
goal for the paraview team.

Message-ID: <6.2.1.2.2.20051012115641.03800f70@pop.mcs.anl.gov>


I'm resending the included email and adding some info.

In the included email, I describe aberrant behavior of the isovalue slider in the GUI of the contour filter.  I've just noticed the same behavior with the isovalue slider I use in my custom interface to select an isovalue.  Whenever I slide the slider back and forth a few times before proceeding with the button click that passes control to paraview to create the isosurface and color it, things work fine.  If I only move the slider a small amount, things usually fail.

The class my slider and the default contour slider have in common is vtkKWScale.  (I use vtkPVScale.)  I can only conclude that somehow, the isovalue selected by the slider is not guaranteed to be set, or passed to where it needs to be passed to.

Was vtkKWScale changed between paraview 2.0.0 and July 11, when I downloaded the development release I'm having trouble with?  Maybe the slider resolution is being processed differently, e.g.?


Thanks.

It doesn't work if I just instantiate the filter, add the default value with the "Add" button, and click "Accept".

Message-ID: <20051013015806.F1CA7727BE@mailhost.nacad.ufrj.br>


I've been using the vtkCellDerivatives.xml package, as described in the Wiki
pages, to produce vorticity data. After deriving cell based vorticity vector
I apply the cell to point data filter followed by the magnitude function of
the calculator in order to generate scalar data and vorticity iso contours
accordingly. My problem begins to appear when I try to animate the iso
contours. After some frames being rendered the animation stops with the
followig error message:

"There was a VTK Error in file: c: dev paraview22 vtk common
vtkDataArrayTemplate.txx (241)
Unable to allocate 2233310 elements of size 4: bad allocation"

Any idea to avoid this error?

Thanks

Renato.

Hi David,

Thanks for your answer.

Before using paraview I was using Xmgrace or Tecplot.
* Xmgrace is a wonderfull tool to make XY plot but onlyx XY plot
* Tecplot is great toolbox because you can make XY plot, 2D and 3D plot at the 
same time. And I think you improve your productivity with this kind of all in 
one tool. But it's expensive and sometimes slow with large dataset.

To answer your question David, I'm dreaming of those kind of features in 
Paraview: have the possibility to make 3D as well as 2D or XY plot with the 
same software. Paraview is already a killer apps for 3D plot but it will be 
be great if the XY plot module can support the following features and in 
particular precise control of graph features such as:

* major and minor thichmarks (in/out)
* grid control of the plot
* Unlimited number of graphs
* Unlimited number of curves on a graph
* customizable colors
* different dashed line styles
* different fill patterns
* different marker symbols with different Color/fill markers
* text annotations with subscripts, superscripts and symbols
* LaTeX and richtext label support
* legends of the graphs
* curve Fitting
* data set operations: evaluating expressions and direct editing of data
* free or pan zooming, masking of data points and marker
* every object can be dragged by mouse


those are some wiches ... but I know i'm dreaming
Paraview is already a very good plot software but I think that with this kind 
of features it will rock !

Regards
Fran?ois

Hej,

I was not aware of the possibility to export raw 2D data! Can you please
tell me how you (Berk) do it?

Concerning the XY plot features I am missing (maybe just because I don't
know of their existence):

* sample/probe data on a custom curve (i.e., not only on a line or
point); resulting from a cut between a plane and a grid boundary.
* plot a custom variable as a function of an other custom variable,
i.e., plot surface pressure as a function of y-value.


Thanks,
Simone

Get more memory. :)

Sorry just being cheeky.

Clearly the memory allocation is failing. If this was a big data set
that's probably all it is. If the dataset is small than there might be a
more serious problem.

I have a 3 wall system very similar to  a cave.  I am using paraview 2.2.1 
with the xml .pvx file.  Does anyone know how to use this correctly?  I have 
3 machines rendering and one for control and my xml file is as follows:

<pvx>
  <Process Type="client" />
  <Process Type="server">
  <Machine Name="ids1"
            Environment="DISPLAY=m1:0"
            LowerLeft="-1.0 -1.0 -1.0"
            LowerRight="1.0 -1.0 -1.0"
            UpperLeft="-1.0  1.0 -1.0" />
  <Machine Name="ids2"
            Environment="DISPLAY=m1:0"
            LowerLeft="-1.0 -1.0 -1.0"

            UpperLeft="-1.0  1.0 -1.0" />

  </Process>
</pvx>

ids4 is control and I run the following commands and only 2 of the 3 nodes 
are launched and it freezes up immediately

ids1: mpirun -np 3 -machinefile /root/mpi.nodefile 
/usr/local/paraview-2.2.1/bin/pvrenderserver /root/passive.pvx
ids4: pvclient -sh=ids1 /root/passive.pvx

Any ideas?

Try turning off "cache geometry" in the animation page.

Hi all

I'm a new Paraview user and very impressed by the capabilities though still
getting to grips with some aspects (such as formats for input files, more on
that later).

I am running 2.0 remotely on FreeBSD amd64 with no problems and 2.2 locally
on Mac OS X (10.4.2) - however whenever I try to save anything on OS X
nothing happens and an error message appears on the terminal, examples
below:

Ghost cell support for AMR datasets is still undecided. The reader
will (most likely) get ghost level requests and can honour those but
the filters down the pipeline will not know to remove ghost levels. I
hope to look into this in the future.

Subject: [Paraview] Compositing
Message-ID: <6.2.1.2.2.20051014151109.03686b38@pop.mcs.anl.gov>



On one visualization cluster I use, I tested both pvserver 2.0.0 and the 07/11 development release in parallel, running the client on my laptop.  I used both processors of each of several 2-processor nodes on the cluster -- nodes that have 1 graphics card apiece.

When I used the "Composite" slider and check box in paraview's "3D View Properties" panel to force compositing above 0.0 MB, the image in the graphics panel looked as though either the frame buffers were not being cleared, or as if both processes on a node were rendering over one another's images.

Yet, when I tried the same thing with pvserver 2.0.0, with the same settings, with another cluster that has 1 graphics card per 2-processor node, the image looked fine.  (On this cluster, I could not test the 07/11 release.)

Should I, in general, expect the munging of the image when running under these conditions?

Unless you compiled with Mesa and are doing offscreen rendering, then
yes you can expect that.

Well Brian, I think this problem can not be related with lack of memory
because I was trying to generate this animation in a machine with 4 Gb of
memory and the model was fairly modest (446,662 tetrahedra and 81,991
nodes).

Renato.

Get more memory. :)

Sorry just being cheeky.

Clearly the memory allocation is failing. If this was a big data set that's
probably all it is. If the dataset is small than there might be a more
serious problem.

OK now this is getting stranger...

On my G4 laptop running 10.4.2 the problem is as stated in my previous post.
An install from the same 2.2.1 tarball on a relatively new dual G5 2GHz
running the same system works fine.  Can anyone think why that might be?

Is it possible that I have conflicting (older) versions of tcl or tk on the
laptop - and if so how do I diagnose this?

I wonder if the builder of 2.2.1 could drop me a line.

TIA for any thoughts and please CC to my email

Subject: [Paraview] Problem when loading many time steps...
Message-ID: <20051016133131.7ADDC72859@mailhost.nacad.ufrj.br>


Hi all,

I've been struggling with Paraview to build an animation for a model with
446,662 tetrahedra, 81,991 nodes, and 1000 time steps. My data is
partitioned in 4 MPI partitions but I'm post-processing data in serial mode
loading each partition and applying the "append dataset" and "clean to grid"
filters in order to join my partitions (I've been doing that because the
server-of-server file has not been working as I expected). Each partitioned
file is stored in Ensight cases (Fortran binary and Ensight standard - not
Gold). 

My problem begins to occur when I try to load these case files. It seems
that Paraview tries to load the result file for each time step before
producing the initial image and this operation takes too much time when the
computer does not freeze. I think that Paraview should load the geometry and
the first (or the last) time step in order to produce an initial image and
leave to load the corresponding file for each time step only when we are
building animated images. Anyway, if anybody could help me with some tip
I'll be very thankful.

Regards

ps.: The related problem has been occuring in a Dell Precision workstation
(P4 3.6 GHz, 4 GB of memory and video card Nvidia Quadro FX 3400 and OS
Windows XP/SP2).

Hello all,

I think there is a memory problem with animation.
Last week, I try to make several simple animations : 100 vtk files
(Animation only on filename)
I make 2 avi files and my PC show an error "Windows must increase your
virtual memory"
I opened my task manager and I used 1.7 Go.
I must exit to paraview to free the memory.

Best regards,

Thierry,

Berk sent out an email with the suggestion that 'Cache Geometry' might
be the problem. Try unchecking 'Cache Geometry' on the animation page
and see if the memory issue clears up.

Yes, that work.
Thanks,
But could we imagine the avi save automatically uncheck 'Cache Geometry' ???

Hi Everyone,

We are intending to create a branch of the ParaView CVS tree 
(including VTK) for the 2.4 release of ParaView either Thursday or 
Friday of this week.  Please limit your CVS commits to things that 
are broken on the dashboard.  I will send out another e-mail when the 
branch has been cut.

Thanks for your cooperation.

I am a new user of paraview. Is it possible to create oilflow (pathlines
on a surface) with Paraview. If yes does anybody know how to do it.

"Pathlines" are usually the flow through transient fields; ParaView doesn't 
do that (yet). The "Stream Tracer" filter can create streamlines through a 
static field.

Create a surface through your data with "Cut" or "Contour" (creates an 
isosurface) and then feed the output to "Stream Tracer".

Hej,

I tried to find a solution some weeks ago and the best way to visualize
mean flow surface pathlines ("oilflow" or "skin friction lines" in
classical aerodynamics) is to constrain the skin friction (coefficient)
vector on the surface of interest ("surface vectors" filter). Then
visualize either using glymphs ... or streamlines emanating from the
surface (you might have to define more than one seed if you have several
attachment and separation lines)


Regards, Simone

Hi All,

The ParaView 2.4 branch has been created for the ParaView (including 
VTK), vtkSNL, and VTKData repositories.  The tag for the branch is 
ParaView-2-4.  I will be starting the release process for ParaView 
2.4.0 (beta release).  If you find problems that need to be merged 
into the 2.4 branch, please let me know (and preferably e-mail me a 
patch to incorporate the changes).  You are now free to make checkins 
to the main CVS trees for ParaView and VTK again.

- Amy

I have encountered a bug when using pvserver with a pvx file in anything 
higher than 2.0.3.  If more than 2 machines are specified paraview both 
pvserver and client hang.  The same configuration works fine with 2.0.3.

Could someone submit this bug for me?  Thanks.

Subject: [Paraview] This is how to run paraview in a cave passive

Message-ID: <BAY103-F75FC36E4936415079AAC7DE760@phx.gbl>

I assume you could run it in active stereo also if you skip the 
quad-buffered part.

Here are the steps to running in a cave environment in passive stereo.

For linux:

1) Setup your rendering node(s) to run quad-buffered stereo (nvidia 
cards:yes ATI:N/A)
2) Download paraview 2.0.3 (anything above has a problem with hanging).
3) Change VTK_STEREO_RED_BLUE to VTK_STEREO_CRYSTAL_EYES in 
paraview-2.0.3/VTK/Rendering/VTKRenderWindow.cxx and make install.
4) Copy the installed paraview dir to all nodes.
3) Create a valid pvx file.
4) Run pvserver either using mpi or for a single machine controlled by 
another use pvserver alone: mpirun -np # -machinefile youfile  
/location/pvserver /locationyourfile.pvx OR pvserver /location/your.pvx
5) From the host run pvclient with the stereo option: pvclient -sh=yourhost 
--stereo
6) Scale your model accordingly. (important in allowing model/data to appear 
in front of screen)

Thats it.

Terry

To clarify that is stereo option 4 in the nvidia driver not quad-buffered

I assume you could run it in active stereo also if you skip the 
quad-buffered part.

Here are the steps to running in a cave environment in passive stereo.

For linux:

1) Setup your rendering node(s) to run quad-buffered stereo (nvidia 
cards:yes ATI:N/A)
2) Download paraview 2.0.3 (anything above has a problem with hanging).
3) Change VTK_STEREO_RED_BLUE to VTK_STEREO_CRYSTAL_EYES in 
paraview-2.0.3/VTK/Rendering/VTKRenderWindow.cxx and make install.
4) Copy the installed paraview dir to all nodes.
3) Create a valid pvx file.
4) Run pvserver either using mpi or for a single machine controlled by 
another use pvserver alone: mpirun -np # -machinefile youfile  
/location/pvserver /locationyourfile.pvx OR pvserver /location/your.pvx
5) From the host run pvclient with the stereo option: pvclient -sh=yourhost 
--stereo
6) Scale your model accordingly. (important in allowing model/data to appear 
in front of screen)

Thats it.

Message-ID: <435FA993.1010101@colorado.edu>

Hello all
   I am trying to determine why my video card does not seem to be used 
by the current paraview volume rendering code.
I am confident it is not using the video hardware because the volume 
rendering on the voxel8.vtk data set is many orders of magnitude
slower than other computers I have tried.  This data set has 27 points 
in 8 cells on an unstructured grid.
(Interactive Render,  3.745 seconds
Still Render,  3.665 seconds for this data set, with both set to the 
projection method)
I am running on a Dell M50 notebook with a Nvidia quadro4 500 GoGl 
graphics card.
I have updated Vbios and drivers to the most recent I can find.

  Does anyone else happen to have the same hardware? Have you found how 
to make it work with paraview?
Does anyone know the exact feature set used in the hardware so I can 
compare it against my card and possibly
other cards I can upgrade to?

  As a reference I use Amira on this same machine and I can volume 
render and spin in real time
much larger data sets. So at least I know the hardware is working.

  Thanks for any help

The feature set needed by the projected tetrahedra mapper in ParaView is
small.  It uses only OpenGL 1.1 compliant methods.  It renders triangle
fans in a display list using a 2D texture that has an internal format of
GL_INTENSITY.  The hardware you describe should have no problem
implementing these features.

If you have the ParaView code, you can look at the projection volume
render implementation at
ParaView/VTK/VolumeRendering/vtkProjectedTetrahedra.cxx.  If you can
compile the code, you might want to try removing OpenGL commands until
it renders fast.  You may also want to check that
vtkProjectedTetrahedraMapper::Render() is being called at all (as
opposed to the Render method of software volume mapper).  I suppose it's
conceivable that ParaView is using the wrong mapper, but I don't know
why it would be hardware specific.

Sorry I can't be of more help, but I cannot replicate your problem.

I have some basic questions about the stereo rendering in ParaView:

1) what type of glasses are needed to view the image (red/cyan, red/ 
blue, etc) ?

2) are colors preserved?

Thanks,

Dave
