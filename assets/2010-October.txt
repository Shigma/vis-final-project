Subject: [Paraview] Problems combining volume and line data
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=M5zniBmRtRN2hXMFqQGfetStjaK7ag7L5_9tC@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
I have some image data that I'd like to volume render. It starts out
as a nifti file and I can view it in paraview after conversion to a
vtk structured grid (using the ITK ConvertBetweenFileFormats tool). I
also have some line data (DTI tracts) that I have converted to
ploydata lines. I can view these (but there is a question about that
later). My problem is that the coordinate systems for the two do not
match up. I also have a converter that transforms the image to
polydata, by using the world coordinates for each pixel. This seems to
match up nicely with the DTI tracts, but of course I can't view this
with the volume renderer. The problem seems to be that the x and y
axes in the structured data seem to be wrong (flipped). Any
suggestions on how to convert images for viewing by paraview and
keeping track of world coordinates?

Also, I'd like to be able to colour my lines by orientation. I can't
figure out how to do this. Is it necessary to include local difference
information in the polydata file, or can I get paraview to compute
this for me for each edge?

Thanks

Hi again,

For this dataset I've managed to hack a solution by making sure that
the initial nifti file was oriented in the direction assumed by the
vtk structured grid. This doesn't deal with direction cosines, but
they aren't significant in this case. I guess the long term solution
is to translate the direction cosines into an orientation that can be
entered into paraviews transformation.

I am still stuck with how to colour lines according to direction though.

Thanks

The way I did this a year or two ago, was using a multiblock reader which had locations of probes (surfaces etc from a cad program) -  (this would correspond top one dataset per contour in your example). Then I made a wrapper around vtkIntegrateAttributes which ran the filter once per block and collected the results into a vtkTable for plotting in the standard chartwindow (though the charts have changed a bit since I did this)
(NB. Paul, I'm sure you've downloaded these classes before because you asked me about them in the past).
All you'd need to do is use the connectivity filter to extract each contour, and place them into a multiblock filter, then use the vtkProbeIntegrationFilter which I don't maintain at the moment, but I'm sure google will find the source.

Yeah, I wondered if you were needing the area.

If you want to compare the speed you could also try using a Python script (assigned to a macro button) which sets up this pipeline in the GUI for you automatically based on your desired contour values, branching out your pipeline into a bunch of Contour plus Integrate Variables filters, and then all of the outputs appended in the end...

There should also be a way to do the Contouring before the programmable filter, and then set up, pretty much like you did, a series of Threshold plus IntegrateAttributes filters and then pull all the results into a table at the end.

Anyway, glad you figured it out.

That's great.

This is very rough, but I was thinking of something like this after setting the programmable filter Output Data Set Type to vtkTable (to test I've created a Wavelet Source and run it through a Gradient filter, and then a Calculator which creates a new value called RTGradMag, which is the magnitude of the gradient vector, then the data is Contoured by RTData value with Compute Scalars checked ON):

Could you be a bit more clear about what you're trying to do? It sounds like you're trying to take your contours and integrate some attributes over each of the contours separately so you get a table which contains as many rows as the number of contours (and maybe separate columns for each attribute)?

As I was playing around I had trouble creating a programmable filter which has a polygonal mesh as input, but a vtkTable as output... Does anyone know if this is possible? Or, does vtkDataObjectToTable filter exist for ParaView so the data could be run through that before the programmable filter?

If I'm understanding what you're trying to do, it seems like it should be possible to implement with a programmable filter if this piece can be accomplished, even without the Integrate Attributes filter.

I'd knock up a filter which stores the desired value each time it executes, and increments the list by one on each execution. This would build up a list (in a polydata or vtkTable for example) which could then be plotted on a graph. A reset button on a custom panel can be used to clear the values. I've done this a couple of times for time related filters when I wanted to plot something unusual over T.

Hi,

I have created a contour and integrated the output to produce a single value.  Is there a way to plot this value as the contour changes?  I have created an animation for the isosurface but cannot see a filter that I could use to plot these values across the range.

Thanks in advance,

Hello Karl,

I wonder, if you had success with your approach!? Actually, I would like 
to do similar with these lines:

from paraview.simple import *
servermanager.LoadState("/home/gcae504/Dissertation/3D_Nielsen/OpenFoam/01_SAS_SSTF_URANS/01__56T_SST/STREAM_SLICE0.pvsm")
SetActiveView(GetRenderView())
Render()
sources=GetSources()
print "Sources: ", sources
FindSource("Slice1").SliceType.Origin = [5.0, 1.0, 1.0]
print FindSource("Slice1").SliceType.Origin
Render()

For the first test, I would like to change the Slice origin.
Unfortunately, the script gives me a segmentation fault using the 
Python-Shell from within paraview and using pvpython it simply gives a 
black picture.
I do not use the python trace state option as there are some settings 
missing and the above approach would fit better into my daily working 
style.

Would be nice, if you have a suggestion how to do this and how to change 
the source file name!?

Thanks in advance!
Fabian

Hi,  I am trying  to compile my (XDMF based) reader with de development 
version of paraview, but a get a parser error:

[  5%] Generating moc_PGDReader_Plugin.cxx
[ 10%] Generating vtkPGDReaderClientServer.cxx
syntax error
*** SYNTAX ERROR found in parsing the header file 
/home/fbordeu/projects/Paraview_PGD_Reader/vtkPGDReader.h before line 
234 ***
make[2]: *** [vtkPGDReaderClientServer.cxx] Erreur 1
make[1]: *** [CMakeFiles/PGDReader.dir/all] Erreur 2
make: *** [all] Erreur 2

this is the problematic line:

     void 
construct_scalar_point_fields_2(std::vector<vtkUnstructuredGrid * >& 
alldata, vtkIdList *ptIdsPGD, std::vector<int> &spacedata);

I already use the //BTX and the //ETX for the variable declaration (like 
in 
http://paraview.org/Wiki/Plugin_HowTo#SYNTAX_ERROR_found_in_parsing_the_header_file)

I think is the vector class that causing the problem, because if a put

void construct_scalar_point_fields_2(vtkUnstructuredGrid *  alldata, 
vtkIdList *ptIdsPGD, int &spacedata);  (of course my code does not work )

the parser work fine.

Any ideas??.

Thanks,

Hello Fabian,

I never got that working and eventually gave up.
But - this was a year ago. In the meantime Utkarsh and David have added a possibility to alter the file when loading a state file. In the GUI a dialog pops up when loading a state file which allows to change every file referenced in the state file. I haven't tried, though, whether this feature is available from Python.

You'll have to BTX/ETX out this method as well. Functions with stl
objects as arguments cannot be wrapped.

It is working, but why???

a have a similar line after without the //BTX, //ETX and the parser 
works fine.

this is magic for me. Thanks

Hello Karl,

oh, I hoped you could get it to work...
Is the new option, you are mentioning, available in the latest git 
version? With 3.8.0 I am not able to see it. And it would be great to 
access this by python!?

Best Regards!
Fabian

Subject: [Paraview] Multi-views with multiple animated cameras
Message-ID: <ABD1B5752A0D724F9E100C97EA9EB7E15CEBB787E2@exvic-mbx04.nexus.csiro.au>

Hi,

I would like to have two separate 3d views of my data that have a different moving camera in each.

If I set up my scene with 2 views, then go to Animation view, it only allows me to add a single "Camera" animation which is only associated with one of the views. I have discovered a clumsy workaround which is:

o start with 1 view
o add a camera animation "Interpolate between locations"
o split the view so there are now 2 views
o add another camera animation "Interpolate between locations", which will be associated with the new view.

May I suggest that in the "Animation view" add drop box that all the individual cameras are listed individually?



On a separate note, is it possible for links between cameras positions to be done on individual elements of the ViewPosition (e.g. x/y/z)?


Cheers,
Ray

Hi,

In the comparative view inspector you can select the time for each of the views. This causes the appropriate file in a sequence to be shown. Is it possible for these times to also activate changes from the Animation View (e.g. transforms)? This does not currently appear to be the case.

Thanks,
Ray

Not sure exactly what you mean. But you want to animate a parameter in
the comparative view, you can add more tracks to the comparative view
for those parameters in addition to the time track.

Is there an option to visualize block (partitions) boundaries? I see a 
contour problem and I would like to see if it falls on  a partition 
boundary.
Hope my question is clear,
Stephen

Subject: [Paraview] PassData() question
Message-ID: <BAY148-w20D59426045E158506D1CAB26E0@phx.gbl>


Hello,
I was just showing to my students how to write a very basic filter, for them to concentrate on the different steps rather than on the algorithm itself but... my example did not work!
The filter was supposed just to withdraw the X components of the normal of a PolyData and the students were asked to show a cylinder before and after the filter so as to compare the shading.
Looking at the code of the PassData() function, it seems that it really copies everything but when I apply my filter, the shading is modified both in the output and the input.
So where is the problem and how should I do it?

int vtkPbPassData::RequestData(
  vtkInformation *vtkNotUsed(request),
  vtkInformationVector **inputVector,
  vtkInformationVector *outputVector)
{
  // get the info objects
  vtkInformation *inInfo = inputVector[0]->GetInformationObject(0);
  vtkInformation *outInfo = outputVector->GetInformationObject(0);

  // get the input and output
  vtkPolyData *input = vtkPolyData::SafeDownCast(
    inInfo->Get(vtkDataObject::DATA_OBJECT()));
  vtkPolyData *output = vtkPolyData::SafeDownCast(
    outInfo->Get(vtkDataObject::DATA_OBJECT()));

  // pass all associated data to output dataset
  output->CopyStructure(input);
  output->GetPointData()->PassData(input->GetPointData());
  output->GetFieldData()->PassData(input->GetFieldData());

  // modify the normals
  vtkPointData *pd = output->GetPointData();
  if (pd ==NULL) {
    vtkErrorMacro(<<"No point data");
    return 1;
  }
  vtkFloatArray *norms = (vtkFloatArray *)pd->GetNormals();
  if (norms == NULL) {
    vtkErrorMacro(<<"Normals must be defined for this filter to work");
    return 1;
  }
  float *coords = norms->GetPointer(0);

  for (int i=0 ; i<output->GetNumberOfPoints() ; i++,coords+=3)
    *coords = 0;

  return 1;
}

Animation view shows/edits the camera animation track for the active
view. You cycle through all the views you have one after the other and
add camera animation tracks for each of them. Since Views are not
really named in the UI, even if we list all cameras in  the animation
view, it will hard for users to realize which camera is associated
with which view.

It's not possible to link individual camera properties using the GUI.
You can always code something up in Python to achieve similar effects.

try using extract surface and then put it in wireframe.

Subject: [Paraview] Particle trajectories with Paraview - How to to use an
 existing dataset (xml / hdf5) - error messages with "Particle Pathlines"
Message-ID: <4CAC6D39.80801@th.physik.uni-frankfurt.de>

Dear Paraview users,

I know that this topic has probably been discussed a couple of times.
But so far I haven't been able to get find any real solutions from the
discussion threads to my specific problem. I'm afraid I will need a
detailed dummy / newbie explanation..


What I would like to do:
----------------------------------------

Plot the trajectory of a moving particle, i.e. trace its path with some
sort of line. The position of the particle is given as x,y,z coordinates
(euclidean position) at certain distinct time steps.
The ability to fade out the track after n time steps would be nice. And
of course I need more than one particle, but that doesn't really matter.


The data format I have:
----------------------------------------

I'm using a converter written by someone else to convert the output of
my simulations to a format that is understood by paraview. In principle
I do have the source code of this converter, but I haven't really
bothered to look into it yet (and don't really have the time to do so now).
The output I get from this converter is hdf5, i.e. a xml file and a .h5
file. The data is organized in frames, one frame per time step. See
below for an excerpt from my xml file.

In principle this dataset just holds the positions and momenta of point
like particles (plus some more scalar values) at given time steps.



What I've done so far / Error messages:
--------------------------------------

Loading this dataset (the xml file) into paraview works fine. It
displays all the points and animating is no problem. Each frame is
correctly associated with the actual time (as denoted in the xml file)
and I can loop through the time steps to see the particles evolve,
inspect scalar properties with glyphs and so on.

But how can I get the trajectory of a particle? Or rather the polyline
connecting the coordinate points the particle has passed at the given
time steps.

I've tried using the "Particle Pathlines" filter but it gives me error
messages like

 "vtkCompositeDataPipeline (0x5c93630): Algorithm
vtkTemporalPathLineFilter(0x54ff590) returned failure for request:
vtkInformation (0x55b9160)"

for Paraview 3.6.2 or

"vtkTemporalPathLineFilter (0x4b7a680): The input dataset did not have a
valid DATA_TIME_STEPS information key"
and
"vtkCompositeDataPipeline (0x4b7c0c0): Algorithm
vtkTemporalPathLineFilter(0x4b7a680) returned failure for request:
vtkInformation"

for Paraview 3.8.0




I would be very glad if you had some suggestions!

Cheers,
Oliver

I may be totally missing the point here, but the two cylinder look

You have shallow copied the point normals from the input to the output. Then overwritten them in the output. And therefore have overwritten them in the input too. so of course they look the same. Passdata just passes the array pointers using a shallow copy

Deepcopy the normals from input to output, then overwrite them. Now you have different arrays for in and out.

this is a very common mistake and your students will learn a great deal about how the pipeline operates. And hopefully you will too!

Subject: [Paraview] PassData() question

Hello,
I was just showing to my students how to write a very basic filter, for them to concentrate on the different steps rather than on the algorithm itself but... my example did not work!
The filter was supposed just to withdraw the X components of the normal of a PolyData and the students were asked to show a cylinder before and after the filter so as to compare the shading.
Looking at the code of the PassData() function, it seems that it really copies everything but when I apply my filter, the shading is modified both in the output and the input.
So where is the problem and how should I do it?

int vtkPbPassData::RequestData(
  vtkInformation *vtkNotUsed(request),
  vtkInformationVector **inputVector,
  vtkInformationVector *outputVector)
{
  // get the info objects
  vtkInformation *inInfo = inputVector[0]->GetInformationObject(0);
  vtkInformation *outInfo = outputVector->GetInformationObject(0);

  // get the input and output
  vtkPolyData *input = vtkPolyData::SafeDownCast(
    inInfo->Get(vtkDataObject::DATA_OBJECT()));
  vtkPolyData *output = vtkPolyData::SafeDownCast(
    outInfo->Get(vtkDataObject::DATA_OBJECT()));

  // pass all associated data to output dataset
  output->CopyStructure(input);
  output->GetPointData()->PassData(input->GetPointData());
  output->GetFieldData()->PassData(input->GetFieldData());

  // modify the normals
  vtkPointData *pd = output->GetPointData();
  if (pd ==NULL) {
    vtkErrorMacro(<<"No point data");
    return 1;
  }
  vtkFloatArray *norms = (vtkFloatArray *)pd->GetNormals();
  if (norms == NULL) {
    vtkErrorMacro(<<"Normals must be defined for this filter to work");
    return 1;
  }
  float *coords = norms->GetPointer(0);

  for (int i=0 ; i<output->GetNumberOfPoints() ; i++,coords+=3)
    *coords = 0;

  return 1;
}

The Xdmf file (or reader) must be not handling the time properly, can you send (or ftp if big) me xdmf and hdf files and I'll have a look at it. I use the pathline filter extensively and know it works ok.

Dear Paraview users,

I know that this topic has probably been discussed a couple of times.
But so far I haven't been able to get find any real solutions from the
discussion threads to my specific problem. I'm afraid I will need a
detailed dummy / newbie explanation..


What I would like to do:
----------------------------------------

Plot the trajectory of a moving particle, i.e. trace its path with some
sort of line. The position of the particle is given as x,y,z coordinates
(euclidean position) at certain distinct time steps.
The ability to fade out the track after n time steps would be nice. And
of course I need more than one particle, but that doesn't really matter.


The data format I have:
----------------------------------------

I'm using a converter written by someone else to convert the output of
my simulations to a format that is understood by paraview. In principle
I do have the source code of this converter, but I haven't really
bothered to look into it yet (and don't really have the time to do so now).
The output I get from this converter is hdf5, i.e. a xml file and a .h5
file. The data is organized in frames, one frame per time step. See
below for an excerpt from my xml file.

In principle this dataset just holds the positions and momenta of point
like particles (plus some more scalar values) at given time steps.



What I've done so far / Error messages:
--------------------------------------

Loading this dataset (the xml file) into paraview works fine. It
displays all the points and animating is no problem. Each frame is
correctly associated with the actual time (as denoted in the xml file)
and I can loop through the time steps to see the particles evolve,
inspect scalar properties with glyphs and so on.

But how can I get the trajectory of a particle? Or rather the polyline
connecting the coordinate points the particle has passed at the given
time steps.

I've tried using the "Particle Pathlines" filter but it gives me error
messages like

 "vtkCompositeDataPipeline (0x5c93630): Algorithm
vtkTemporalPathLineFilter(0x54ff590) returned failure for request:
vtkInformation (0x55b9160)"

for Paraview 3.6.2 or

"vtkTemporalPathLineFilter (0x4b7a680): The input dataset did not have a
valid DATA_TIME_STEPS information key"
and
"vtkCompositeDataPipeline (0x4b7c0c0): Algorithm
vtkTemporalPathLineFilter(0x4b7a680) returned failure for request:
vtkInformation"

for Paraview 3.8.0




I would be very glad if you had some suggestions!

Cheers,
Oliver

  Yes, I know, It's impossible to obtain an isosurface with the maximum 
value,
but I want just use it in order to compute a new value (max - 0.1 for 
example) and use this new value for threshold.

So my actual problem is how create the contour ?
I tried with :

cf = vtk.vtkContourGrid()
cf.SetInputConnection(pdo)
cf.SetValue(1,0.1)

I didn't obtained some images. Perhaps I need some lines code with 
self.GetPolyDataOutput() ?

Thank you.

Hi everybody,

I begin with Paraview and I would like to have a variable input (like 
the maximum temperature at each time step) for the isosurface into the 
contour filter.
In this way, I created a programmable filter to get the maximum 
temperature :

pdi = self.GetPolyDataInput()
pdo =  self.GetPolyDataOutput()
numPoints = pdi.GetNumberOfPoints()
temperature = pdi.GetPointData().GetArray("temperature")

max=-1.0
for i in range(0, numPoints):
    if (max < temperature.GetValue(i)):
        max = temperature.GetValue(i)
print(max)

But, now my problem is how create the contour filter ?
I tried with :

cf = vtk.vtkContourGrid()
cf.SetInputConnection(pdo)
cf.SetValue(1,0.1)

but I didn't obtained some images. Perhaps I need some lines code with 
self.GetPolyDataOutput() ?

Thanks in advance,
Guillaume

The use of a programmable filter is perhaps more than you actually needed, now that you know how to get the range of the input. I would start simply with the Python shell, create a contour and create its representation like this:

SetActiveSource(Input) # set your input here, if not already selected as "active"

c1 = Contour()
c1.Isosurfaces = [max - 0.1]
Show(c1) # this will create the geometry and add it to your view
Render()

Otherwise, if you still want to do it with a programmable filter, you're probably missing the last two lines:

c = vtk.vtkContourFilter()
c.SetInput(pdo)
c.SetValue(0, 0.01)
c.Update()
self.GetOutput().ShallowCopy(c.GetOutput())

The Update and the ShallowCopy() are the most important.

Of course I suspected that a shallow copy was performed, and I explained
 to my students that it was to save memory and avoid duplicated of 
information in the pipeline, but when I looked at the code of the PassData() method, it was not clear if "arrayIndex = this->AddArray(dsa->GetAbstractArray(i));" actually performed a shallow copy or not.
So I tried to do a deep copy but I surely made a mistake since nothing happen and finally I decided to ask you concerning the first issue.
So thanks to confirm that a shallow copy was the reason of my first problem.
Now please help a little bit more to fix this one:

  // since pass data makes shallow copies, make a deep copy of the normals
  vtkFloatArray *normals = vtkFloatArray::New();
  normals->DeepCopy(input->GetPointData()->GetNormals());

  float *coords = normals->GetPointer(0);

  for (int i=0 ; i<output->GetNumberOfPoints() ; i++,coords+=3)
    *coords = 0;

  output->GetPointData()->AddArray(normals);

As far as I read in the VTK doc, adding an array with the same name as an existing one will replace it by the new one, so I expected that "normals" would replace the existing array of normals, but I am probably wrong...

Subject: RE: [Paraview] PassData() question
















You have shallow copied the point normals from the input to the
output. Then overwritten them in the output. And therefore have overwritten
them in the input too. so of course they look the same. Passdata just passes
the array pointers using a shallow copy

 

Deepcopy the normals from input to output, then overwrite them.
Now you have different arrays for in and out.

 

this is a very common mistake and your students will learn a great
deal about how the pipeline operates. And hopefully you will too!

Subject: [Paraview] PassData() question





 

Hello,

I was just showing to my students how to write a very basic filter, for them to
concentrate on the different steps rather than on the algorithm itself but... my
example did not work!

The filter was supposed just to withdraw the X components of the normal of a
PolyData and the students were asked to show a cylinder before and after the
filter so as to compare the shading.

Looking at the code of the PassData() function, it seems that it really copies
everything but when I apply my filter, the shading is modified both in the
output and the input.

So where is the problem and how should I do it?



int vtkPbPassData::RequestData(

  vtkInformation *vtkNotUsed(request),

  vtkInformationVector **inputVector,

  vtkInformationVector *outputVector)

{

  // get the info objects

  vtkInformation *inInfo = inputVector[0]->GetInformationObject(0);

  vtkInformation *outInfo = outputVector->GetInformationObject(0);



  // get the input and output

  vtkPolyData *input = vtkPolyData::SafeDownCast(

    inInfo->Get(vtkDataObject::DATA_OBJECT()));

  vtkPolyData *output = vtkPolyData::SafeDownCast(

    outInfo->Get(vtkDataObject::DATA_OBJECT()));

one thing ... what if the normals are double precision? use this
vtkDataArray *inNormals = input->GetPointData()->GetNormals()
vtkDataArray *normals = inNormals->NewInstance();
normals->DeepCopy(inNormals);

then
for (vtkIdType i=0; i<N; i++)
     double n[3];
     normals->GetTuple(i,n);
     n[0] = 0.0;
     normals->SetValue(i,n);
}

finally

 output->GetPointData()->SetNormals(normals);

I wrote this from memory, so it surely contains mistakes. Hopefully it'll work

JB


  float *coords = normals->GetPointer(0);

  for (int i=0 ; i<output->GetNumberOfPoints() ; i++,coords+=3)
    *coords = 0;

  output->GetPointData()->AddArray(normals);

As far as I read in the VTK doc, adding an array with the same name as an existing one will replace it by the new one, so I expected that "normals" would replace the existing array of normals, but I am probably wrong...

Subject: RE: [Paraview] PassData() question
You have shallow copied the point normals from the input to the output. Then overwritten them in the output. And therefore have overwritten them in the input too. so of course they look the same. Passdata just passes the array pointers using a shallow copy

Deepcopy the normals from input to output, then overwrite them. Now you have different arrays for in and out.

this is a very common mistake and your students will learn a great deal about how the pipeline operates. And hopefully you will too!

Subject: [Paraview] PassData() question

Hello,
I was just showing to my students how to write a very basic filter, for them to concentrate on the different steps rather than on the algorithm itself but... my example did not work!
The filter was supposed just to withdraw the X components of the normal of a PolyData and the students were asked to show a cylinder before and after the filter so as to compare the shading.
Looking at the code of the PassData() function, it seems that it really copies everything but when I apply my filter, the shading is modified both in the output and the input.
So where is the problem and how should I do it?

int vtkPbPassData::RequestData(
  vtkInformation *vtkNotUsed(request),
  vtkInformationVector **inputVector,
  vtkInformationVector *outputVector)
{
  // get the info objects
  vtkInformation *inInfo = inputVector[0]->GetInformationObject(0);
  vtkInformation *outInfo = outputVector->GetInformationObject(0);

  // get the input and output
  vtkPolyData *input = vtkPolyData::SafeDownCast(
    inInfo->Get(vtkDataObject::DATA_OBJECT()));
  vtkPolyData *output = vtkPolyData::SafeDownCast(
    outInfo->Get(vtkDataObject::DATA_OBJECT()));

  // pass all associated data to output dataset
  output->CopyStructure(input);
  output->GetPointData()->PassData(input->GetPointData());
  output->GetFieldData()->PassData(input->GetFieldData());

  // modify the normals
  vtkPointData *pd = output->GetPointData();
  if (pd ==NULL) {
    vtkErrorMacro(<<"No point data");
    return 1;
  }
  vtkFloatArray *norms = (vtkFloatArray *)pd->GetNormals();
  if (norms == NULL) {
    vtkErrorMacro(<<"Normals must be defined for this filter to work");
    return 1;
  }
  float *coords = norms->GetPointer(0);

  for (int i=0 ; i<output->GetNumberOfPoints() ; i++,coords+=3)
    *coords = 0;

  return 1;
}

Message-ID: <AANLkTik8Ct4ywK1x0a+cxA6o26GDifQqZxMevQdwLsZ+@mail.gmail.com>

If you open vase_1comp.vti from VTKData and set representation to points,
all of the points appear black. If you apply a glyph filter (2D vertex
glyphs) you can see some of the points of the vase are white. If you set the
Maximum Number of Points to 50,000 in the properties tab of the glyph
filter, you can pretty much see the vase (as white points). Is there a way
to see these white points without applying the glyph filter? Shouldn't this
be what you see as soon as you open the data set (it is displaying the
points when representation=points, so it might as well color them, right?)?

Hi Utkarsh,

I have been experimenting and I believe that the "add camera" option in the "Animation View" only adds a camera to the *newest* view and *not* the selected view as you would expect. If this is a bug it should be easy to fix.

I am using ParaView 3.8.0 32 bit on Windows.

Cheers,
Ray

Animation view shows/edits the camera animation track for the active
view. You cycle through all the views you have one after the other and
add camera animation tracks for each of them. Since Views are not
really named in the UI, even if we list all cameras in  the animation
view, it will hard for users to realize which camera is associated
with which view.

It's not possible to link individual camera properties using the GUI.
You can always code something up in Python to achieve similar effects.

Oliver,

I received your files (off list) and gave them a try. I see now what the problem is.

You've got a temporal collection, and inside this, is a multi-block set of particles. What is happening is that the pathline filter is being called once per block by the executive, but the DATA_TIME_STEPS key is stamped on the multi-block wrapper, and each time the pathline filter is executed on a sub-block, the sub-block is extracted from the collection and passed in - without - the DATA_TIME_STEPS key stamped on it.

Now this is fixable in two ways.
1) Have the executive stamp the sub-blocks with the wrapper's TIME key as they are extracted and passed in.
2) Have the Xdmf reader stamp the sub-blocks as they are generated (easier to do IMHO).

BUT. 

Even if we make one of these fixes, I suspect the pathline filter will fail. This is because the pathline filter caches particle positions (w.r.t time) each time it is executed and builds a trail for each particle ID. If it is looped over a multiblock dataset - the executive reuses the same copy of the pathline filter for each block - so the pathline filter will get highly confused as it receives 5 executions for each time step - and the ID's present will be also occur 5 times (assuming you have Ids from 0-N for each block, if you have 0-5N and they are not duplicated, then it might just be OK).

Anyway. This is a serious problem as the pathline filter won't operate on the multiblock data. I'll add this to my list of 'one day I must fix this' - actually, I will soon need to use the pathline filter on multiblock data myself, so this is a good heads-up that I need to do something.

Here are ideas - 

Solution 1: Doesn't work. If you use Extract-Block filter in ParaView, it just creates a new multiblock dataset with the unwanted blocks removed - it doesn't solve the problem of the sub-block stamping, you'd still need to fix 2) above in the reader. I have my own vtkFlattenDataset Filter (similar to extract blocks but removes the multiblock hierarchy) which I tried and it does work (for one block, but I didn't check for multiple to see if Ids are reused across blocks as my filter appends the datasets if >1 are taken). Unfortunately, this filter is not very well tested so not safe for public consumption.

Solution 2: If you can you split your blocks into separate Xdmf files so that you load 5 files instead of 1 (sorry, this is painful), then all will be ok. _This will at least work_

Solution 3: I could add multiblock support for the pathline filter, but this would take a spare afternoon/day which I don't have right now.

If I think of a solution 4, I'll post again.

JB

The Xdmf file (or reader) must be not handling the time properly, can you send (or ftp if big) me xdmf and hdf files and I'll have a look at it. I use the pathline filter extensively and know it works ok.

Subject: [Paraview] Particle trajectories with Paraview - How to to use an existing dataset (xml / hdf5) - error messages with "Particle Pathlines"

Dear Paraview users,

I know that this topic has probably been discussed a couple of times.
But so far I haven't been able to get find any real solutions from the
discussion threads to my specific problem. I'm afraid I will need a
detailed dummy / newbie explanation..


What I would like to do:
----------------------------------------

Plot the trajectory of a moving particle, i.e. trace its path with some
sort of line. The position of the particle is given as x,y,z coordinates
(euclidean position) at certain distinct time steps.
The ability to fade out the track after n time steps would be nice. And
of course I need more than one particle, but that doesn't really matter.


The data format I have:
----------------------------------------

I'm using a converter written by someone else to convert the output of
my simulations to a format that is understood by paraview. In principle
I do have the source code of this converter, but I haven't really
bothered to look into it yet (and don't really have the time to do so now).
The output I get from this converter is hdf5, i.e. a xml file and a .h5
file. The data is organized in frames, one frame per time step. See
below for an excerpt from my xml file.

In principle this dataset just holds the positions and momenta of point
like particles (plus some more scalar values) at given time steps.



What I've done so far / Error messages:
--------------------------------------

Loading this dataset (the xml file) into paraview works fine. It
displays all the points and animating is no problem. Each frame is
correctly associated with the actual time (as denoted in the xml file)
and I can loop through the time steps to see the particles evolve,
inspect scalar properties with glyphs and so on.

But how can I get the trajectory of a particle? Or rather the polyline
connecting the coordinate points the particle has passed at the given
time steps.

I've tried using the "Particle Pathlines" filter but it gives me error
messages like

 "vtkCompositeDataPipeline (0x5c93630): Algorithm
vtkTemporalPathLineFilter(0x54ff590) returned failure for request:
vtkInformation (0x55b9160)"

for Paraview 3.6.2 or

"vtkTemporalPathLineFilter (0x4b7a680): The input dataset did not have a
valid DATA_TIME_STEPS information key"
and
"vtkCompositeDataPipeline (0x4b7c0c0): Algorithm
vtkTemporalPathLineFilter(0x4b7a680) returned failure for request:
vtkInformation"

for Paraview 3.8.0




I would be very glad if you had some suggestions!

Cheers,
Oliver

Hello, paraview users

I draw the file ?Sample_inter.vtk? on ParaView. (ref:attached file)
I chose ?Gouraud? in Interpolation option.
The contor picture doesn?t seem to be interpolated by 4 points.
However,the graph which is made by PlotOverLine shows the gradation of
4 points scalar.
Why are they different?
Does anyone know this problem?
How can I make contour picture interpolated by  Gouraud ?

I look forward to your reply to my inquiry

Thank you so much for your very detailed answer!

I think, I'll go with solution 2 and try modifying our converter such
that it outputs the blocks to separate files. Or rather, in a first
attempt, I will simply discard blocks 2 through 5 completely, since I
don't really need this information right now anyway.

Best regards,
Oliver

This is because the pathline filter caches particle positions (w.r.t time) each time it is executed and builds a trail for each particle ID. If it is looped over a multiblock dataset - the executive reuses the same copy of the pathline filter for each block - so the pathline filter will get highly confused as it receives 5 executions for each time step - and the ID's present will be also occur 5 times (assuming you have Ids from 0-N for each block, if you have 0-5N and they are not duplicated, then it might just be OK).

If you use Extract-Block filter in ParaView, it just creates a new multiblock dataset with the unwanted blocks removed - it doesn't solve the problem of the sub-block stamping, you'd still need to fix 2) above in the reader. I have my own vtkFlattenDataset Filter (similar to extract blocks but removes the multiblock hierarchy) which I tried and it does work (for one block, but I didn't check for multiple to see if Ids are reused across blocks as my filter appends the datasets if >1 are taken). Unfortunately, this filter is not very well tested so not safe for public consumption.

Hello All,

am I the only one who has problems while building plugins with Development 
installation? I have downloaded fresh 3.8.1-Dev, unpacked, configured my 
plugin with CMake, generated makefile and get after typing make the following:

make[2]: *** No rule to make target 
`/home/kitware/Kitware/ParaView-3.8.1/Support/qt-4.6.2/bin/lib/libQtUiTools.a', 
needed by `libGUIMyPlugin.so'.  Stop. 
make[1]: *** [CMakeFiles/GUIMyPlugin.dir/all] Error 2
make: *** [all] Error 2

I have never specified explicit dependence of my plugin on 
`/home/kitware/Kitware/ParaView-3.8.1/Support/qt-4.6.2/bin/lib/libQtUiTools. 

Am I doing something wrong?

Hi Alexey,

The dependency is inherited. As stated in the wiki
(http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView:Plugin_Deployment_with_Development_Installs)
you'll need to provide your own installation of Qt 4.6.2 - but not necessarily
using the path used at Kitware on their build hosts.

I typically fix up the Makefiles *every time cmake has been rerun* as follows:

* alter the installation path of qt (use something appropriate instead of
  /path/to/qt/lib !)

sed -i -e
's,/home/kitware/.*ParaView-3-.*/Support/qt-4.6.2/bin/lib,/path/to/qt/lib,g' \
        CMakeFiles/*.dir/build.make \
        CMakeFiles/*.dir/flags.make \
        CMakeFiles/*.dir/link.txt

* get rid of ffmpeg, hdf5, sz and python dependency (which my plugins do not
depend on)

sed -i -e '/^lib.*.so: \/home\/kitware\/.*ParaView-3-.*\/Support\//d;' \
        CMakeFiles/*.dir/build.make
sed -i -e 's/ [^ ]*libhdf5.a//; s/ [^ ]*libsz.a//; s/-lpython2.5//;' \
        CMakeFiles/*.dir/link.txt

Hope that helps
Sven

Thanks for reporting this. It will be fixed soon (definitely before
the next release).

Hi Sven,

thanks a lot! I have also found similar workaround how to built it but I 
thought it should work straightforwardly. Now I see - I have to provide third 
party libraries and there is even a page in the Wiki.

Hi Felipe,

I had this problem too. My workaround was to remove 
/usr/lib/paraview-3.8/libstdc++.so.6 file.

Hope this helps!

Hi Felipe,

Does cmake work when you don't set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH? Have you tried
prepending your LD_LIBRARY_PATH instead? It is strange that cmake would
break when you set LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/paraview-3.8:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

Hi Felipe,

According to http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView_Binaries ParaView 3.8.1 64bit
has been built on Debian Etch 4.0r8 using GCC 4.1.2. Your Ubuntu 10.04 64bit
ships with GCC 4.4.3. You should avoid using a newer GCC release for your plugin
or the plugin will most likely not work with PV 3.8.1 on older distributions.

Try to install the lucid packages gcc-4.1 and g++-4.1 and add the following
options to the cmake command line
         -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER:FILEPATH=/usr/bin/gcc-4.1 \
         -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER:FILEPATH=/usr/bin/g++-4.1
Set LD_LIBRARY_PATH as you did, too.

Or - but that's a lot more work and probably overkill - set up a virtual machine
and install Debian Etch 4.0r8 in it in case you want to be really sure that your
plugin works on any host where PV 3.8.1 x86_64 runs and you plan to pass it to
others.

Sven

Does cmake work when you don't set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH?  yes
Have you tried prepending your LD_LIBRARY_PATH instead? ther is no 
LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable in my env

finally a erase the /usr/lib/paraview-3.8/libstdc++.so.6 (Alexey idea)

Thanks

Hi Felipe,

What libraries are missing? I just fixed the missing
/Utilities/Xdmf2/vtk/*.h files and can upload the tarball with the missing
headers shortly.

Subject: [Paraview] ANN: Qt/Testing converted to a submodule
Message-ID: <AANLkTim=wh2fUiQ2sUN-t+KWoE0Xb-+dV5sSVKGm9oe6@mail.gmail.com>

Hello All,

Qt/Testing is now a git submodule so that it may be used by other projects.
Please be advised that the next time you pull from master or release you
will need to additionally perform a "git submodule update --init". If using
an older version of git you may need to instead use "git submodule init"
followed by "git submodule update".

Thank you for your patience and please reply to this email if you experience
any issues.

Hi Dave,

all the libraries (that I need) are there, only the headers where  
missing.
I only have to wait for 2 patches to be applied to the xmdf library,  
so my reader can work properly with the binaries.

http://public.kitware.com/Bug/view.php?id=11278

Thanks to everyone for the help.

Subject: [Paraview] order of components XDMF tensors
Message-ID: <AANLkTinAz6H_uEXj-S68bFtfNjRpUi_Mku4Y40CZx-nx@mail.gmail.com>

I have taken to building my vectors in XDMF using the following XML:

< ---- BUNCH OF SETUP XML>


<Attribute Type="Vector" Center="Node" Name="force">
	<DataItem ItemType="Function" Function="JOIN($0, $1, $2)" Dimensions="4000 3">
		  <DataItem Name="fx" Format="HDF" DataType="Float" Dimensions="4000">
			  test.h5:/fx
		  </DataItem>
		  <DataItem Name="fy" Format="HDF" DataType="Float" Dimensions="4000">
			  test.h5:/fy
		  </DataItem>
		  <DataItem Name="fz" Format="HDF" DataType="Float" Dimensions="4000">
			test.h5:/fz
		</DataItem>
	</DataItem>
</Attribute>								

So, for cartesian tensors, this is the usual (x,y,z) ordering mapped
to (comp0, comp1, comp2)

In the case of both symmetric tensors (Type=Tensor6) and non-symmetric
tensors (Type=Tensor), what ordering should I use?  This type of
information is not on the XDMF website and I wasn't able to figure it
out via playing around with visual representation of mock tensors in
PV itself.

Thanks so much.

Hey David,

Seems to be because it's a 2D vector. I converted it into 3D with the calculator and it seemed to work.

If you look back in the mailing list there should be some better explanation of the reasons behind this, but when you choose Points representation for ImageData, it is only rendering the outer layer of points, not all of them from inside the block, too. When you apply the glyph filter you are creating PolyData, and so the rendering algorithm is different, and you can see all the points throughout the space.

If you apply a glyph filter (2D vertex glyphs) you can see some of the points of the vase are white. If you set the Maximum Number of Points to 50,000 in the properties tab of the glyph filter, you can pretty much see the vase (as white points). Is there a way to see these white points without applying the glyph filter? Shouldn't this be what you see as soon as you open the data set (it is displaying the points when representation=points, so it might as well color them, right?)?

Thanks Eric. If anyone else is curious, the Calculator filter command is:

ImageScalarsGradient_X * iHat + ImageScalarsGradient_Y * jHat + 0 * kHat

Message-ID: <4CAF46CF.70901@ec-nantes.fr>

with this exemple you can find the correct order.

for tensor6 the order is 0 1 2 1 3 4 2 4 5 so like in a matrix
0 1 2
1 3 4
2 4 6

I am pretty sure that for tensor the order is  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
0 1 2
3 4 5
6 7 8

but you have to check

Hello,

I'm trying to write python code to to process an EnSightReader object depending on how many blocks it has. Can anyone tell how to "get" this information?

Also, what is the general method for getting object information; for example how would I get the name of each block in the EnSightReader object?

Thanks,

There's no way of "fetching" the mapper through Python. You can affect
parameters on the mapper using properties on the representation
itself.

Thanks - those are indeed the correct ordering for the tensors.
Thanks for the nudge towards figuring it out.

Subject: [Paraview] setting the flags for compilation for offscreen
	rendering support
Message-ID: <AANLkTimYG3yxNPz09rT1zx0VRhYfcfiA8SbMrfKN8eQu@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have been using ParaView with Python scripts successfully, but I still
have the problem of offscreen rendering not working properly, i.e., I always
get a screen popping up every few seconds while the script is running. From
the discussion below I understand that setting up offscreen rendering
properly is done at compile time:

http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2010-April/016734.html

But I am not sure where I need to set the flags mentioned, such as
VTK_USE_OFFSCREEN, VTK_USE_DISPLAY, etc. I would like to try this myself
before I ask the admins on the cluster I am using to do it for me. I have
been looking at the Makefiles and config files in the 3.8.1 version, but
there are so many of them...Should this be done in vtkPVConfig.h.in perhaps?
Thanks!

Milos

You should set VTK_USE_OFFSCREEN to on (I'm assuming you've already turned
on VTK_OPENGL_HAS_OSMESA).  Then you'll need to set the OSMesa libraries and
header files (OSMESA_INCLUDE_DIR and OSMESA_LIBRARY).  When I've done this
in the past I didn't set VTK_USE_DISPLAY so you can probably leave that as
is.  To be safe, you may want to set OPENGL_INCLUDE_DIR, OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY,
and OPENGL_glu_LIBRARY to the OSMesa versions of those (I'm not sure if this
is necessary or not).  Finally, then you'll need the following in your
python script to turn on off screen rendering:

import paraview.servermanager as sm
options = sm.vtkPVOptions()
options.SetUseOffscreenRendering(1)

Dear All,

I am trying to animate an eigenmode (a vibration mode) of an aircraft using the .vtk format in ParaView.
I managed to Wrap by Vector the result and using an appropriate scale factor (e.g. 5 0 -5 0 5) to get the desired outcome of motion.

Although, the color of the aircraft remains the same and it is not scaling from maximum to zero etc.
In other words, the color is static and it does not represent the motion of the aircraft.

Is there a way to interpolate (both motion and color) between the deformed and the undeformed state.

Thank you in advance.

Best regards,
Georgia

Hi,

I really appreciate the programmable filter in python.
It is really powerfull.

Now, is there a way to add GUI controls to a programmable filter ?
Let's say I want to propose to users a file selector, or the control of 
a parameter.

I use Paraview 3.8.1

You can create a .xml file, that you will load as a plugin.
See Examples/Plugins/HelixSource.

Hi,

I have write i python shript. It working fine in IDLE. But I want to run it
in the paraview python shell. I think the problem is that I use a relativ
path and not a absolut one.
How do i do to make the python shell use relative paths?

when I use os.listdir('.')

I allways get the same result.

['bin', 'lib', 'Uninstall.exe'] and that is the folders from E:\ParaView

Hello, paraview users

I draw the file ?Sample_inter.vtk? on ParaView. (ref:attached file)
I chose ?Gouraud? in Interpolation option.
The contor picture doesn?t seem to be interpolated by 4 points.
However,the graph which is made by PlotOverLine shows the gradation of
4 points scalar.
Why are they different?
Does anyone know this problem?
How can I make contour picture interpolated by  Gouraud ?

I look forward to your reply to my inquiry

Subject: [Paraview] How to add vector/scalar field as attributes to a
	vtkPointSet (vtkPolyData, ...)?
Message-ID: <924556.53075.qm@web29705.mail.ird.yahoo.com>

Hi,

Like the title say, I would to like to add some attributes to a vtkPointSet 
(vtkPolyData and vtkUnstructuredGrid).
The attributes are vector(2D, 3D,...) field or scalar field. 

For a scalar Field, If I want to add an attribute to the cells , I do: 
output->GetCellData()->AddArray( data) and 
output->GetPointData()->AddArray(donnees);  for the points
For the moment it is ok, because I can select them in Paraview.

But now, I have a 2D (or 3D) vector field (velocity) and I would to add the 
velocity field for the points or the cells.  How can I do that ?
Moreover, if I want to show somme arrow (to show the direction of the vectors) 
should I use the glyph filter ?

Thank you.

I think this is a rendering issue and not an interpolation issue.  From the
2d plot you can see that it's properly interpolating the values.  I think
the quadrilateral is getting rendered as 2 triangles in which case the
diagonal values appear to be constant since the 2 end points are at the same
value.

Subject: [Paraview] How to add vector/scalar field as attributes to a

For the velocity array you'll need to set the number of components.  You
probably want to set the number of components to 3 for both 2D and 3D so
that ParaView can manipulate the vector quantities (for 2D just set the last
component to 0).

Using the glyph filter will give you arrows for showing the velocity
magnitude and direction.

Thanks to point to this example.
3 more questions.

* When the script is long, it is not convinient to implement it
inside the XML file. Is there an example to use a "import script" ?

* Does the XML file provides a Property to select a file to be opened ?

*  Imagine that the 1st argument is a file to open. The second
argument possible variables to load. Is it possible to fill a list
with those variables get from the file opened ?

Thanks

Hi,

I'm sorry if this is answered elsewhere, I have googled around, but
not found anything that actually fixes the problem.

I have Windows XP SP2, completely fresh install, I just installed it
in my virtualbox.  The only things on the box are virtualbox tools,
paraview 3.8.1 which I just downloaded, and process monitor.  When I
bring up the Python Shell and type
   
import PyQt4.QtGui

I get 

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<console>", line 1, in <module>
ImportError: DLL load failed: This application has failed to start
because the application configuration is incorrect. Reinstalling the
application may fix this problem.

There is no other python or VTK on the box to confuse things.

In an attempt to fix the problem I added some things to my PATH and PYTHONPATH.
You can see what I added by these commands I type in the Python Shell:

>>> import os
>>> print os.environ['PATH']
C:\Program Files\ParaView 3.8.1\bin;C:\Program Files\ParaView 3.8.1\lib\paraview-3.8;C:\WINDOWS\system32;C:\WINDOWS;C:\WINDOWS\System32\Wbem
>>> print os.environ['PYTHONPATH']
C:\Program Files\ParaView 3.8.1\bin;C:\Program Files\ParaView 3.8.1\lib\paraview-3.8
>>> 

In an attempt to debug the problem I installed process monitor and this is its
output with a filter that only allows output for the paraview.exe programme
(there are some failures, but a lot of successes on opening PyQt4\QtGui.pyd)

I can't believe this can be difficult to fix, surely other people have ran into
this?

Anyway, any help much appreciated!

Humm, It was not my intention to package PyQt4 in the Windows installer.

Quite frankly, I will mostly likely rerun the package step and make sure
that those site-packages are not included. Regardless, nothing in ParaView
uses PyQt. I had it built on my system when I was building the VisTrails
plugin for the 3.6.2 release.

That said, I have a feeling your error is most likely Visual Studio runtime
related as I can import that module with no errors on my home Windows 7
machine with no development tools installed.

Upgrading to SP3, installing the runtime redistributable at the system level
(
http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=9b2da534-3e03-4391-8a4d-074b9f2bc1bf&displaylang=en),
or possibly copying the runtime dlls (msvcm90.dll, msvcp90.dll and
msvcr90.dll) located in ParaView/bin, into
ParaView/bin/Lib/site-packages/PyQt4 may get this working for you.

Even if nothing in paraview uses PyQt, my paraview python plugins that
I have written use PyQt to get user input.  I know I am only one user
here, but I would greatly appreciate it if windows paraview continued
to ship with PyQt4.  It is a handy thing to have.

Thanks for your help!

Subject: [Paraview] solid color in anumation
Message-ID: <AANLkTikbWPj8sgS5Hp3J-8R+ozmLtDtknhvTqN_T9b6B@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Paraview users,

I am making a simple animation of a scalar field in 2D.
i have a set of vtu files with increasing numbering that represent
subsequent timesteps.
i can animate this without a problem however there is a slight
inconvenience.
each new timestep is visualized as a solid color surface. is there a way to
set the visualization properties for all timesteps at once?
or is there a threshold value i can set at which the visualization switches
from solid color to color by scalar?

i am running ParaView-3.8.1-Linux-x86_64

Thanks
Thomas

This is the way I use this feature.
Your script and all the libraries inside it must been viewable in your
PYTHONPATH.

* Does the XML file provides a Property to select a file to be opened ?

In my xml files, I ask for the complete path to the file to read.

Here again. It would be great. But I don't think it is possible.

CMake is the development version from git.

These builds use OSMesa and should not be using the GUI.

They have CMake variables set which I think mean QT should not be
touched at all :

PARAVIEW_BUILD_ParaView:BOOL=OFF
PARAVIEW_BUILD_QT_GUI:BOOL=OFF

In any case I told CMake where to find qmake :

QT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE:FILEPATH=/usr/bin/qmake-qt4

and the error persists.

Here's what I have done:

//output is a vtkPolyData

int nbComponents = 2;

vtkSmartPointer<vtkFloatArray> dataToAdd = 
vtkSmartPointer<vtkFloatArray>::New();

vtkIdType nbElems = output->GetNumberOfCells(); 
int size = nbElems * nbComponents;

dataToAdd->SetNumberOfComponents(2);
dataToAdd->SetNumberOfTuples(size);
dataToAdd->SetName(name);
    
int cpt = 0;
for(unsigned int i = 0; i < values.size(); i += 2)
{
    dataToAdd->InsertTuple2(cpt, values[i], values[i+1]);            
    cpt++;
}

output->GetCellData()->AddArray(dataToAdd);        


Everything is ok and I can see elements that are colored corresponding to the 
magnitude, x and y components.

But now, If I want to display gliph of these velocities I can't. Only attibutes 
attached to the points are presents.  So, What is the way to display gliphs of 
attributes that are attached to some elements.

Thank you.

vtkPointSet (vtkPolyData, ...)?

For the velocity array you'll need to set the number of components.  You 
probably want to set the number of components to 3 for both 2D and 3D so that 
ParaView can manipulate the vector quantities (for 2D just set the last 
component to 0).

Using the glyph filter will give you arrows for showing the velocity magnitude 
and direction.

Subject: [Paraview] Descriptive statistics filter
Message-ID: <20101013155304.19753kxzvy40bq9s@horde.vki.ac.be>

Dear ParaView users & developers,

  I have an ouput file that comes from a cfd simulation. After I load  
the data in paraview and apply the descriptive statistics filter, I  
see a table presenting mean value, min., max. ... of my quantities.  
I'd like to ask if it's possible to export this table as a text file  
so that I can plot the values of certain columns with gnuplot, for  
example.

  My second question concerns the keyword 'Cardinality' in descriptive  
statistics. I'd expect this to relate somehow to the number of degrees  
of freedom of my mesh, but the numbers in 'Cardinality' column do not  
always correspond. When I make a slice of my mesh and apply the  
statistics to it, for example, the cardinality values are far bigger  
than the number of nodes of the sliced plane or curve. Is cardinality  
always the total number of nodes of the grid?

Thank you.

  Best regards,

Martin Vymazal

Yes, clicking on the table so it becomes the active view and then  
choosing the File->Save Data menu will let you export it as a CSV file.

Cardinality is the number of observations encountered. For point data,  
it will be the number of nodes in the mesh (PLUS an extra entry for  
each time a node is shared on more than one process if you have  
ParaView running in parallel). For cell data, it will be the number of  
cells in mesh.

The reason that you see a large number of points for the cardinality  
of a slice is that slicing creates a new mesh whose nodes are not  
always nodes of the original mesh... they are intersections of mesh  
edges with the slice plane. If you really want properties of a subset  
of mesh nodes, you can use the Elevation filter plus a Threshold to  
select a subset of cells or points and pass that to Descriptive  
Statistics. You might also be able to use the selection mechanism to  
select nodes of the original mesh with your view's camera set to  
parallel projection (instead of perspective projection). Once you have  
the nodes selected, use the Extract Selection filter to create a new  
dataset from the selected nodes.

	Hope this helps,
	David

Slicing MAY also convert hexahedral cells into triangles before  
intersecting edges with the slice plane (I just don't recall for sure).

Subject: [Paraview] Animation  follow path
Message-ID: <4CB615C5.9030504@lpl.arizona.edu>

I'm using ParaView 3.8.1 and trying to create an animation sequence over 
some topography.    The 'help' built into the tool when looking for help 
on animation appears to refer to a much earlier version of paraview, 
which appears to have changed considerably.  

When I open the Animation View window,  I can create an 'orbit' 
animation using selecting 'Camera' and 'Orbit' then clicking on the plus 
sign to insert orbit parameters.   However, when I try to create an 
animation that follows a path using 'Camera' and 'Follow Path',  it isnt 
obvious where one sets up the path to follow.   Clicking on the plus 
sign doesnt do anything.   

Any suggestions on how to create a simple animation following a path 
(fly over)?

thanks much

Subject: [Paraview] RAW to STL Script Help?
Message-ID: <AANLkTim0Q7x3ay8rgKxPsyxM1mWEaFbcu_e_z5xhDoyj@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,

I have a large number of RAW files (unsigned characters in 3
dimensions of varying size) and I need to extract isosurfaces and save
them as STLs. I've been using paraview to do this (and it's awesome!),
but doing it by hand is becoming impractical. Unfortunately, I've been
having trouble figuring out how to script it.

In particular, I can't figure out how to load RAW files or how save
STLs. In fact, the best documentation on the python API I can find is
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Python_Scripting ... Could
someone direct me towards something a bit more comprehensive?

Thanks in advance,

Christopher Olah

PS. I hope this isn't too trivial to write to you about -- I couldn't
really find anything on what level of question was appropriate for
this list.

Hi

I posted about this ages ago, and with your help got it working on
linux, but now I am having problems getting it going under Windows.

Let me summarize what I am doing.

I am writing a Python plugin, and I want to popup a custom dialog.
For simple dialogs I have found:

   import PyQt4.QtGui
   l = PyQt4.QtGui.QInputDialog.getText(wid, 'Slice', 'Length')

to work fine.  But I need more complicate dialogs.  Yes I have read

   http://paraview.markmail.org/message/6h767kpak5dcoqwt

(thanks Pat), otherwise surely I would not have made it this far!

My code is below.  It runs fine under paraview linux, and it runs fine
in a nonparaview simple test app under Windows, but when running under
paraview on Windows, it hangs when I push the OK button.

In the URL above, it says one shouldn't use exec_() and I am
(incidentally it works under linux ok).  I tried to use setModal(True)
then show(), but control returns immediately to me, then paraview
hangs anyway.

Also in the URL above, the example works just fine for me, unless I
put a simple 'print "hello"' at the end, then paraview hangs.
Something way beyond my meagre skills is happening here.  Please any
help is much appreciated!


import os,sys
from PyQt4.QtGui import *
from PyQt4.QtCore import *
import paraview

def callback_wrapper(func):
   v = paraview.vtk.vtkObject()
   def wrap(*args, **kwargs):
      v._args = args
      v._kwargs = kwargs
      v.Modified()
   def callback(o, e): func(*v._args, **v._kwargs)
   v.AddObserver("ModifiedEvent", callback)
   return wrap

class MyDialog(QDialog):

   def __init__(self, *args):
      QDialog.__init__(self, *args)
      self.start = 0

      buttonBox = QDialogButtonBox()
      okButton = buttonBox.addButton(buttonBox.Ok)

      QObject.connect(okButton, SIGNAL("clicked()"), self.accepted)
      layout = QVBoxLayout()
      layout.addWidget(buttonBox)
      self.setLayout(layout)

   @callback_wrapper
   def accepted(self):
      self.start = 1
      self.accept()

#app = QApplication(sys.argv)        

foo = MyDialog()

# this hangs paraview under windows
#foo.setModal(True)
#foo.show()

# this works on linux, but hangs (just prints OK:) under windows if
# user pushes OK
if foo.exec_():
   print "OK:", foo.start
else:
   print "They cancelled", foo.start

Hey Christopher,

Well, I think that page is the best current documentation. Which version of ParaView are you using? (The API has changed quite a bit over various versions, and if you're using an earlier version than 3.8 or 3.9, the Python API has gotten much nicer these days.)

I'm not actually sure how to write the STL file with PV 3.8.1, but with the current development version (3.9) you can load the data and write the STL with something like this (which I used the Python State Trace to figure out the commands -- ask if you don't know how to use this functionality because it's _really_ helpful in writing scripts):

# =====================
try: paraview.simple
except: from paraview.simple import *

noisy_10x100x100_sphere_raw = ImageReader( guiName="noisy_10x100x100_sphere.raw", ScalarArrayName='ImageFile', DataExtent=[0, 10, 0, 100, 0, 100], FilePrefix='/Users/emonson/Programming/ParaView_git/ParaViewData/Data/noisy_10x100x100_sphere.raw', NumberOfScalarComponents=1, FileDimensionality='3', DataByteOrder='LittleEndian', DataOrigin=[0.0, 0.0, 0.0], FilePattern='%s', DataSpacing=[10.0, 1.0, 1.0], DataScalarType='unsigned int', FileLowerLeft=1 )

Contour1 = Contour( guiName="Contour1", Isosurfaces=[1021190000.0, 1043550000.0, 1065900000.0], ComputeNormals=1, ComputeGradients=0, ComputeScalars=0, ContourBy=['POINTS', 'ImageFile'], PointMergeMethod="Uniform Binning" )

Show()

ResetCamera()
Render()

writer= CreateWriter("raw_contours.stl", Contour1)
writer.UpdatePipeline()
# =====================

Note that some of the options that are specified might be defaults that you wouldn't have to include, but I got these from the State Trace. Also, I didn't try to include the loop for varied file names...

Maybe someone else can chime in with the STL writing if you're using 3.8.1.

Hope this points you in the right direction,
-Eric

Hey Eric,

Thanks! I was using 3.8.1 but I'm pulling from git right now. :) If
someone knows how to write an STL in 3.8.1, it would still be nice to
know, of course.

Thanks again,

Christopher

I've actually never heard of python state trace. So, please, go on.
The only thing that comes up with Google is a paraview mailing list
thread about it being broken and a few miscellaneous mentions.

Subject: [Paraview] adjusting the glyph filter
Message-ID: <AANLkTikp_pGXQh_7qm0+P1Ambbruz=xvFF68Q7AVYMd-@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Paraviewers

The Glyph Filter includes in its properties a glyph type "Arrow."
Each arrow can have its radius and length (for both the tip and shaft)
be drawn proportionally to the value of the vector it represents.

I'm asked to slightly (?) adjust the glyph filter so that, for each
individual arrow, its length is determined by the value of vector A,
and its radius is determined by the value of vector B [and its color
is determined by vector C [ and its opacity is determined by vector
D]].

I've been a programmer for many years, but have come to Paraview just
this week.  I've been searching and stepping through some of the
tutorials / examples, but so far nothing looks like what I'm trying to
do.

My question, for lovely veterans: at what level would this type of
change need to occur?  Can it be done just through "Programmable
Filters?" (So far, I don't think so).    Do I have to learn VTK and
compile new filters from there?

To sweeten the deal, I have a bit of a budget to get this done (by 21 October).

my setup:

I'm running ParaView universal binary on Mac OS X 10.6.4 (Snow Leopard)
ParaView Version 3.8.1  32-bit
Qt version 4.6.2

Hi Andy,

Thank you for replying.
Do you mean that the rendering image doesn't reflect the result of
interpolation ?
If so, what is the most common usage?
In what situation is the interpolation used ?

I don't have an answer, but while you're waiting for a better response
these might be working taking a look at:

Hi Christopher,

the python trace allow the user to record some actions in the UI and
generate a python script out of it.
Depending on the ParaView version:
- You will have some button start/stop trace on the right side of the
Python shell.
- or from the Git repo, directly accessible from the Tools menu.

Enjoy,

Seb

This wiki page describes some of the functionality, but doesn't seem to be quite up to date regarding "Trace State". If you find the things Sebastien is mentioning and have trouble just let us know.

The documentation is for the current (git) version. You can go back
and look in the history to see the comment for 3.8.

Subject: [Paraview] [paraview] compiling Mesa with paraview
Message-ID: <FE9BA413-28F8-4090-BDD8-0502378D4CF4@lanl.gov>

I'm recently started to install paraview on a new machine,
OS is Ubuntu, a 64 bit machine.
Mesa itself is built smoothly and my cmake configuration
is the same as I built before (I successfully built Mesa with
PV many times), I've tried three versions of Mesa to be
integrated into PV, 7.9, 7.6.1 and 7.0.4. About 48% of building PV,
I get the following consistent error

the newer versions just have libOSMesa.so.7 undefined reference...
Is there anything I need to do to configure Mesa, or is this a  
paraview issue?

Yes.

If your grid uses triangles then the image should match the interpolation
for the typical node/point based interpolation.

Hi Joshua,

The best way to configure paraview with OSMesa is to use the following
settings.

VTK_USE_X : OFF
OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY : <leave this blank>
OPENGL_glu_LIBRARY: to osmesa's libGLU.so.
OSMESA_LIBRARY : /usr/lib64/libOSMesa.so
VTK_OPENGL_HAS_OSMESA : ON
VTK_USE_MANGLED_MESA : OFF
VTK_USE_OFFSCREEN : ON

I also recommend you either use an older Mesa (7.5.2 for example) or use the
latest from their git repository as there is a major bug in the latest
released versions for which ParaView will crash.

Mesa has suffered some turmoil lately as far as OSMesa is concerned.

The end result is that the most recent version of mesa and the
development version can not have libOSMesa.so and libGL.so (not even the
one produced along with OSMesa) linked by the same application.

My OSMesa build configuration is here :

http://www.cdash.org/CDash/viewNotes.php?buildid=748789

I build Mesa from git every night like this :

rm -rf /home/kevin/mesa_osmesa/*
cd /home/kevin/mesa
make realclean
git pull origin
./autogen.sh \
  --prefix=/home/kevin/mesa_osmesa/ \
  --with-driver=osmesa \
  --disable-gallium

make -j8
make install

Just a comment:

If you are building ParaView for desktop use, do not set OSMESA (i.e.
set VTK_OPENGL_HAS_OSMESA to OFF). Set OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY to Mesa's GL
library.

If you are building ParaView for server use (only) and you want
offscreen rendering support, follow Dave's instructions.

After Mesa's latest changes, you need to build two different versions
of ParaView if you want offscreen rendering with OSMesa on the server.

Hi Rob,

I would look at the new vtkGlyph3DMapper which is a new representation type
in ParaView. This will be a good foundation for a custom representation. To
learn how to add a new representation you can read
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Plugin_HowTo#Adding_new_Representations_for_3D_View_using_Plugins_.2A_new_in_version_3.7

This problem should be fixed with the git-master following recent
changes in the wrapping code. In any case that warning is harmless. In
the old implementation of the wrapping code for Append looks something
as follows:

static PyObject *PyvtkInformation_Append(PyObject *self, PyObject *args)
{
  /* handle an occurrence */
  {
  vtkInformation *op;
  vtkInformationIntegerVectorKey  *temp0;
  PyObject *tempH0;
  int      temp1;
  op = (vtkInformation *)PyArg_VTKParseTuple(self, args, (char*)"Oi",
&tempH0, &temp1);  // WARNING_PRODUCER
  if (op)
    {
    temp0 = (vtkInformationIntegerVectorKey
*)vtkPythonGetPointerFromObject(tempH0,(char*)"vtkInformationIntegerVectorKey");
    if (!temp0 && tempH0 != Py_None) goto break38;
    ....
    }
  }
break38
.....
  /* handle an occurrence */
  {
  vtkInformation *op;

  vtkInformationDoubleVectorKey  *temp0;
  PyObject *tempH0;
  double   temp1;
  PyErr_Clear();
  op = (vtkInformation *)PyArg_VTKParseTuple(self, args, (char*)"Od",
&tempH0, &temp1);
  if (op)
    {
    temp0 = (vtkInformationDoubleVectorKey
*)vtkPythonGetPointerFromObject(tempH0,(char*)"vtkInformationDoubleVectorKey");
    ....
    }
  }
...
}

It was reading the int/double argument first and then testing the type
of the key. Since the vtkInformationIntegerVectorKey was checked
before the vtkInformationDoubleVectorKey, the warning was produced by
the line maked WARNING_PRODUCER.

The new wrapping code checks the type of the key first and hence won't
produce the same warning.

Are you working from a paraview installer, or compiling paraview yourself?
I was able to reproduce the linux bug (by putting a 'print "hello"' at the
end) and then solve it by commenting out two lines in
ParaView/Qt/Python/pqPythonShell.cxx.  Just search for the lines with
"processEvents" and comment them out and then recompile.


I'll try to explain it why this fixes the problem-

Before paraview executes the python script it acquires a lock.  The lock is
part of the python C api to help make things thread safe (
http://docs.python.org/c-api/init.html#thread-state-and-the-global-interpreter-lock).
 Paraview doesn't use threads, but it uses multiple python
interpreters,
and each interpreter has its own "thread state".  So before any code is
executed by the paraview python shell, the shell acquires the lock to
activate its interpreter.

Next, the python script hits a print statement which sends an output string
to the paraview python shell.  The shell calls processEvents so that the
widget has an opportunity to repaint itself (make the text appear on your
screen) without having to wait for the entire python script to complete
execution.  The problem is that during processEvents, the events generated
by calling show on a PyQt widget are also processed.  While processing these
events, PyQt tries to acquire the lock itself, fails, and then waits-
paraview hangs because this all happens in the same thread.  The fix is
either to comment out the processEvents call in pqPythonShell.cxx, or
release the lock before calling processEvents and then reacquire it
afterward.

I have never tested PyQt+Paraview on Windows, there may be further bugs.
Also, there could be other scenarios where the paraview python shell and
PyQt fight over the lock.

Hope this helps a bit!

Hi Shinya,

If I am not mistaken Gouraud is an interpolation for shading than for
field values. Try crating a Sphere source and changing the
Interpolation selection between Gouraud and Flat, hopefully you'll see
the difference in shading.

Subject: [Paraview] Fwd: Interpolation problem
In-Reply-To: <AANLkTinLBBOeMO8MRapoii6e0t_bm9Cw94Wi1K--81mt@mail.gmail.com>
Message-ID: <C8DDD418.7D69%kmorel@sandia.gov>

If I can, I would like to expand the conversation a little bit because I don?t think the technical details are telling the whole story.

The root of the problem is that the interpolation of a scalar field based on the four corners of a square (or any quadrilateral) is in general ill-defined.  We usually mean for field to be linearly interpolated between the points.  That is, find some function of the form f(x,y) = a*x + b*y + c that gives the correct scalar for all four points.  But, in fact, four points over constrain the problem and no such linear function exists.

So really, the differences you are seeing are the differences between how the internal VTK functions resolve the interpolation and how your rendering hardware is doing it.  I haven?t looked at the source code, but I?m assuming that VTK is using something like bilinear interpolation.  Bilinear interpolation works by first interpolating the scalar on opposite edges and then interpolating again between these edges to get a point in the interior.  Bilinear interpolation has several advantages: it can be done independently of neighboring polygons and still be C0 continuous, it is easy to implement, it is smooth in the interior, and it gives an interpolation that intuitively makes sense.  Note, however, that bilinear interpolation is not linear.  This is evident by your plot (which is a parabola).

Your graphics driver is much more concerned with speed.  As such, it takes your quadrilateral and breaks it into triangles.  This circumvents the whole interpolation problem because the three vertices of the triangle perfectly constrain the linear function.  It is also easy for the graphics hardware to compute the interior of the triangle.  Of course, the result is not as, shall we say, pleasant as bilinear interpolation.  It is not smooth: There is a C1 discontinuity at the line where the quadrilateral was split into triangles.  Also, this splitting is arbitrary.  The split could just as easily been made in the opposite direction.  In that case, you would see a red line go from upper left to lower right instead of that blue line from lower left to upper right.

So the rendering is probably not what was indented when defining the scalar value on a quadrilateral.  However, ParaView allows it because correcting the problem would make the rendering prohibitively slow.  Furthermore, it is rarely even noticeable.  The square in this example is worst case.  Not only do no linear functions fit, they are not even close.  Thus, the different ways to resolve the issue are dramatically different.  In a practical application, this does not occur.  The scalar values tend to more closely fit a linear function.  If a quadrilateral like this occurred in a real data set, it might be indicative of a meshing problem.  Furthermore, real meshes have lots of facets.  If this square was a small part of a much bigger surface, differences in interpolation are less meaningful.

In short, the interpolation your graphics hardware performs is sufficient for qualitative analysis (getting an overview of behavior), which is all its really good for anyway.  When you do qualitative analysis (showing actual numbers in the data) such as in your plot, the more accurate interpolation models of VTK are used.

Hi Andy,

Thank you for replying.
Do you mean that the rendering image doesn't reflect the result of
interpolation ?

Yes.

If so, what is the most common usage?
In what situation is the interpolation used ?

If your grid uses triangles then the image should match the interpolation for the typical node/point based interpolation.

I tried your configuration for 7.5.2
I also included the OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY in my configuration
since if I don't include OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY, I would get the
same error

this is what I'm getting

Hi Josh,

Just to confirm, do you want to build with off screen or on screen
rendering? If you want off screen then you cannot link to libGL and you need
to leave OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY blank (I believe because all of the GL symbols
are then included in libOSMesa).

Also you need to build Mesa as Kevin described with these options.

rm -rf /home/kevin/mesa_osmesa/*
cd /home/kevin/mesa
make realclean
git pull origin
./autogen.sh \
 --prefix=/home/kevin/mesa_osmesa/ \
 --with-driver=osmesa \
 --disable-gallium

make -j8
make install

I just updated the wiki ParaView build page with instructions on how to build with MESA.  Note that there is a known bug with MESA 7.8.2 which has been reported to the MESA developers.

Message-ID: <4CB8E134.4080809@gmail.com>

  Hi,

     I understand that Paraview has Xdmf support.

     I tried executing the examples from the following link

         http://www.xdmf.org/index.php/Write_Xdmf

     the python shell in Paraview says that the Xdmf module is not found.

     Any ideas ?

Regards

Hey Nicholas,

If you build ParaView with XDMF_WRAP_PYTHON: ON, then the build process should generate _Xdmf.so (or whatever your platform's extension is for python module libraries) in the [build]/bin directory. If that is in your PYTHONPATH, you should be able to substitute "from _Xdmf import *" instead of the example's original first line.

There may be a more elegant way to install it so you can use the original line and not have to alter your PYTHONPATH, but hopefully this will get you started until someone more knowledgeable speaks up.

Note that if you build ParaView with Python support, the other thing that should get built is libvtkXdmfPython.so, which includes the vtkXdmfReader and Writer, which can be very handy.

Talk to you later,
-Eric

Hi,

thanks.  Windows is not my platform of choice, i've never successfully
compiled up paraview with visual studio before.  anyway now I have a
lot more motivation, and i do have the Paraview Guide with
instructions, so I will give it a go.

Thanks Pat.  I think I follow.  Although I'm not sure what affect not
calling processEvents will have on my widget.  Will it never have a
chance to update?

Ok, thanks.

Indeed it does, it is nice to know I'm not trying to figure this out
all by myself.

Before compiling paraview on windows, you might try this-

You can prevent processEvents from being called by taking the python console
widget out of the loop.  Paraview sets sys.stdout and sys.stderr to a helper
object that directs the output to the widget (where processEvents is
called):

 >>> import sys

>>> sys.stdout.__class__

<type 'vtkPVPythonInterpretorWrapper'>

So you can reroute output to disk:

sys.stdout = open("stdout.txt", "w")
sys.stderr = open("stderr.txt", "w")

Now you won't see any output in the paraview gui, it will be written to
those files instead.  The output isn't flushed on every write, so you might
not see anything in the files until you quit paraview.  You could define
your own stdout object that calls write on a file followed by flush.

Since nobody was able to help me on the cmake list, may be this is a PV issue?
My problem is I do not manage to compile a plugin with the development distribution.
After a couple os discussions on the cmake list, my CMakeLists.txt now looks like this:

SET(ParaView_DIR /ParaView-Development-3.8.1-Linux-i686/lib/paraview-3.8)
FIND_PACKAGE(ParaView REQUIRED)
INCLUDE(${PARAVIEW_USE_FILE})

ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN(MyPlugin "1.0"
                                     SERVER_MANAGER_XML MyPlugin.xml
                                     SERVER_MANAGER_SOURCES vtkMyPlugin.cxx)

INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES(/ParaView-3.8.1/VTK)

but the header files are still not found:

[ 14%] Generating vtkSMXML_MyPlugin.h
-- Generate module: MyPlugin
[ 28%] Generating vtkMyPluginClientServer.cxx
Scanning dependencies of target MyPlugin
[ 42%] Building CXX object CMakeFiles/MyPlugin.dir/vtkMyPlugin.o
/vtk/vtkLocal/MyPlugin2/vtkMyPlugin.cxx:26:35: error:

find /ParaView-3.8.1/VTK -name vtkMarchingCubesCases.h
/ParaView-3.8.1/VTK/Filtering/vtkMarchingCubesCases.h

And this plugin compiles well with a PV-3.8.0 source installation.

Any help?

Thanks, that worked just fine!
Another thing that works is if I just don't do any print'ing ;-)

When I get my compilation working, I would like to test this.  Is this
something like what I need?

PyGILState_Release(state);
QCoreApplication::processEvents(QEventLoop::ExcludeUserInputEvents);
PyGILState_STATE state = PyGILState_Ensure();

However, where do I get hold of the current 'state'?

Would it be possible for you to submit a patch so this is fixed for
all?

Thanks

Matt

Hi,

A while ago I had a problem in my python plugin of trying to determine
the current working directory of the script.  Pat solved the problem
by patching the method

   void pqPythonDialog::runScript(const QStringList& files)

in

   Qt/Python/pqPythonDialog.cxx

so it had this in it:

   if(file.open(QIODevice::ReadOnly))
      {
      this->runString(QString("__file__ = \"%1\"").arg(files[i]));
      this->runString(file.readAll().data());
      }

I don't think this made it into the main paraview repo.  Is it
possible for this patch to go in?

Thanks

Matt

Subject: [Paraview] //Remote rendering with tesla cards
Message-ID: <006501cb6ea6$03fa8f90$0befaeb0$@tu-bs.de>

Dear all,

We are trying to utilize our cluster in order to visualize data directly on
the compute nodes. 24 nodes (each has 8 computing cores) are equipped with 4
Tesla cards. We were following the instructions given by the ParaView wiki
and by those slides here:

www.vpac.org/files/GPU-Slides/Visualisation_using_the_GPU_Computing_Processo
r.pdf

Meaning that Xservers are installed and glxgears is giving good results on
the remote nodes. However, if we try to use ParaView on the headnode
(assuming pvserver is running on the remote nodes, just using one GPU per
node:

#PBS -l nodes=dnode161:ppn=2+dnode162:ppn=2

/hpc3lustre/software/lib/openmpi-1.4.1-gcc41/bin/mpirun -np 2 \
/hpc3lustre/software/irmb/paraview/ParaView-3.9.0-dev/bin/pvserver \
-display :0.0 --use-offscreen-rendering

), we were confronted with the following errors after connecting from the
client to the servers:

Waiting for server...
X Error: GLXBadContextTag 173
  Extension:    157 (Uknown extension)
  Minor opcode: 5 (Unknown request)
  Resource id:  0x40010b0

...

X Error: GLXBadContextTag 173
  Extension:    157 (Uknown extension)
  Minor opcode: 145 (Unknown request)
  Resource id:  0x1
Xlib: sequence lost (0x10000 > 0x693c) in reply type 0x1!
Write failed: Broken pipe

Probably we are just missing a tiny thing, but looking for solution yet
yielded no results :( Maybe one of you had the same problems and some more
exprience? Also I think, the problem is not located at the remote nodes but
on the headnode. I am looking forward for any hints and suggestions. Thanks
in advance!

Ben.

P.S.: When does ParaView will get a "reload"-pipeline button?

    BUG #11327. Fixed freeze after WriteImage in parallel pvbatch.

    vtkSMUtilities::SaveImageOnProcessZero has a broadcast to ensure that all
    processes have correct error code in symmetic mode. In
non-symmetric mode that
    was resulting in hangs since on the root node would call
    SaveImageOnProcessZero(). Fixed that by using the non-broadcast
variant when not
    running in symmetric mode.

Subject: [Paraview] Visualisation for the solution with variable time step
	size
Message-ID: <20101018160906.42ba97e6@kairos.BauV.UniBw-Muenchen.de>

Hello,

I am solving a time-dependent pde and want to use Paraview for the
visualisation of the solution. The time integration is chosen
adaptively, i.e. the size of the time steps is not constant.
Furthermore I want to compare the numerical solution with different
time discretizations. Therefore I need to encode the information about
the time in the vtk files.

Actually I would prefer to use legacy-ASCII-vtk-files
(example.001.vtk, example.002.vtk,.....).

Is there any possibility to get this information in the legacy vtk-files
so that Paraview can use them? Or do I really need to use vtk-xml-files?

I have attached a minimal example with 3 legacy-vtk-files.
If I open these file with Paraview, I don't see any information about
time in Paraview, but the files are just numbered (0,1,2).

Kind regards,

Thomas

Hi Fred, The marching cubes header is in the development tarbal. I am taking
a look now into why the headers aren't automatically included simply by
including PARAVIEW_USE_FILE.

Hi,

How to create a Reader using a Python script ?

I would like to study the simplest example to do this ?

For now I can create a Source that uses a Python ProgrammableFilter
but I want to consider it as a Reader since I have a filename
as entry.

Thanks

I'm assuming you want something more refined than:

Programmable Filter:

filename = 'myfilename'
execfile(my_python_code.py)

---
where filename is used within my_python_code as a variable?

Yes, especially if you want to design a plugin where filename
is an entry choosen by a user.
I am looking for a real example in the configuration of a
ServerManagerConfiguration file for a python reader.

Hi Patrick,

Is there a reason you don't want to write a C++ plugin to achieve this?
Readers are fairly straightforward to implement with ParaView and there are
plenty of examples. Plus, I don't know if it is possible to achieve what you
want with Python API alone, but hopefully someone will correct me if I'm
wrong.

Cheers,
Adriano

Subject: [Paraview] Volume calculation of unstructured meshes (or image
	stacks)
Message-ID: <1D31903B135C481B83B2EE6AAB31E099@notebook>

Hi All,

What is the general approach for calculating volumes of unstructured meshes?

I have a generalised problem of converting scan data of various types into
something where I can automatically calculate the volume of objects. I have
been trying a number of approaches but I am getting results which suggest
that I am doing it incorrectly.

The most likely pipeline so far looks like:

Image Stack -> Threshold -> Iso Volume -> Integrate Variables

However I see other approaches like vtkMassProperties.

I am guessing I need the best end datatype to calculate volume and process
of getting to that datatype? Or is it better just to work on the image data?

Cheers,

Paul

Hi Patrick,

Have you tried adding a StringVectorProperty to your XML for a filename
(with <FileListDomain name="files"/>) and having a GUI XML file for adding a
reader?  I think someone suggested you look at the helix source xml (
http://paraview.org/gitweb?p=ParaView.git;a=blob;f=Examples/Plugins/HelixSource/helix.xml;h=d6c385561d9cdffc5298ced17d700bae8bc167b6;hb=HEAD)
and you can see how to add the GUI XML file in the other reader example (
http://paraview.org/gitweb?p=ParaView.git;a=tree;f=Examples/Plugins/Reader;hb=HEAD
)

Note: I haven't actually tried this as I'm not at a computer today with the
source on it.

Regards,
Paul

Hi Paul,

Thanks to share your experience on this topic.
As I wrote to another paraview user,
my python code is a small 200 lines using netCDF4, numpy
and its conversion is not as straightforward as it could be because I use
many numpy functions.
Of course, I can do it but the python approach is more attrative.

I have tried to add
     <StringVectorProperty
        name="FileName"
        animateable="0"
        command="SetFileName"
        number_of_elements="1">
        <FileListDomain name="files"/>
     </StringVectorProperty>

to the helix.xml example but
when I load it nothing appears in the source menu.

What I would like is a Python Reader example.
If someone has this to share, I am very interested.

Patrick

You will need a separate xml file for the GUI plugin to tell paraview about
the new format.  Look at pqReader.xml in
"Examples/Plugins/Reader".

In doing so, it seems that the reader must have a "SetFileName" function.
How do you handle this with python ? Or can you avoid this ?

I do not think the integration of a python script in the GUI can be as
perfect as that of a reader writen in c++.

What would happen if the square were not in the (x,y) plane. The function
become a f(x,y,z) function ?
Or by writing f(x,y) you meant f(i,j) where i and j are locl coordinates ?

Message-ID: <5ED9044701A7DA499E9A3740DE53467E04CEAC65@lola2003svr2>

 
Hi,
 
This must be very simple in Paraview but I can't seem to work it out.
 
I'd like to save a view for one dataset so that I can then go and get
another dataset and present the new data at exactly the same viewpoint
thus making it easy to see the differences.
 
I thought I could do it using the 'save' function in the Camera
positions menu but this doesn't quite work.  When I read the next
dataset in and load the view, the zoom and positioning are wrong, even
though the actual view angle may be correct.
 
How do I do this?
 
Thanks,
 
Phil

The interpolations (in VTK) are done in parametric space, so the location of the polygon in 3D space is inconsequential.  Although I used x,y in my discussion, it would be more correct to use parametric parameters u,v (or i,j or whatever).  I didn?t talk about parametric space because I didn?t want the explanation to get more complicated.

If I can, I would like to expand the conversation a little bit because I don?t think the technical details are telling the whole story.

The root of the problem is that the interpolation of a scalar field based on the four corners of a square (or any quadrilateral) is in general ill-defined.  We usually mean for field to be linearly interpolated between the points.  That is, find some function of the form f(x,y) = a*x + b*y + c that gives the correct scalar for all four points.  But, in fact, four points over constrain the problem and no such linear function exists.

So really, the differences you are seeing are the differences between how the internal VTK functions resolve the interpolation and how your rendering hardware is doing it.  I haven?t looked at the source code, but I?m assuming that VTK is using something like bilinear interpolation.  Bilinear interpolation works by first interpolating the scalar on opposite edges and then interpolating again between these edges to get a point in the interior.  Bilinear interpolation has several advantages: it can be done independently of neighboring polygons and still be C0 continuous, it is easy to implement, it is smooth in the interior, and it gives an interpolation that intuitively makes sense.  Note, however, that bilinear interpolation is not linear.  This is evident by your plot (which is a parabola).

Your graphics driver is much more concerned with speed.  As such, it takes your quadrilateral and breaks it into triangles.  This circumvents the whole interpolation problem because the three vertices of the triangle perfectly constrain the linear function.  It is also easy for the graphics hardware to compute the interior of the triangle.  Of course, the result is not as, shall we say, pleasant as bilinear interpolation.  It is not smooth: There is a C1 discontinuity at the line where the quadrilateral was split into triangles.  Also, this splitting is arbitrary.  The split could just as easily been made in the opposite direction.  In that case, you would see a red line go from upper left to lower right instead of that blue line from lower left to upper right.

So the rendering is probably not what was indented when defining the scalar value on a quadrilateral.  However, ParaView allows it because correcting the problem would make the rendering prohibitively slow.  Furthermore, it is rarely even noticeable.  The square in this example is worst case.  Not only do no linear functions fit, they are not even close.  Thus, the different ways to resolve the issue are dramatically different.  In a practical application, this does not occur.  The scalar values tend to more closely fit a linear function.  If a quadrilateral like this occurred in a real data set, it might be indicative of a meshing problem.  Furthermore, real meshes have lots of facets.  If this square was a small part of a much bigger surface, differences in interpolation are less meaningful.

In short, the interpolation your graphics hardware performs is sufficient for qualitative analysis (getting an overview of behavior), which is all its really good for anyway.  When you do qualitative analysis (showing actual numbers in the data) such as in your plot, the more accurate interpolation models of VTK are used.

Hi Andy,

Thank you for replying.
Do you mean that the rendering image doesn't reflect the result of
interpolation ?

Yes.

If so, what is the most common usage?
In what situation is the interpolation used ?

If your grid uses triangles then the image should match the interpolation for the typical node/point based interpolation.

Hi,

I've been trying to use the 'probe location' filter to extract values at
certain points.  How does this work?  I find that if I bring the filter
up and enter a position then I can see the point displayed at the
position that I wanted.  When I go to the information tab, the data at
this position is not there.  I've found that I can randomly get the data
to appear on the information tab but I've not been able to work out what
I did to achieve this.  I must have refreshed the graphics or page
somehow but most times I can't get the data out.

Any ideas?

Thanks,

Phil

You need to hit "Apply" after having positioned the probe filter at
the location you want. After that the "Information' tab will update.

Are you trying to do this without compiling anything?  I'm not even sure you
can load in a GUI plugin via XML - maybe someone else can confirm here?

Is there a python command in a Python script that will tell ParaView to exit?

Thanks,

  Hi Phil,

Saving (and re-applying) the camera settings should do what you need.

Are the two datasets the same size?
Did you apply the saved settings after loading the second dataset?

Nope. Python is not supposed to "drive" the ParaView Qt GUI. If that's
what you indeed want, why not simply use pvpython/pvbatch?

Not unless you want to type something like this...

    from PyQt4 import QtCore
    QtCore.QCoreApplication.quit()

Hi,

I get an error while trying to build the make files for building
paraview on Windows.  The error is:

   Entering             Z:/Utilities/VTKClientServer/Common
CMake Error at Utilities/VTKClientServer/vtkClientServer.cmake:16 (INCLUDE):
  include could not find load file:

    C:/build/pv/VTK/Utilities/vtkCommonKit.cmake
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  Utilities/VTKClientServer/vtkClientServer.cmake:37 (PV_PRE_WRAP_VTK_CS)
  Utilities/VTKClientServer/Common/CMakeLists.txt:2 (PV_WRAP_VTK_CS)

   Returning to         Z:/Utilities/VTKClientServer

Now for the details.  I have Cmake 2.8.2, paraview source 3.8.1 from
http://www.paraview.org/files/v3.8/ParaView-3.8.1.zip, QT 4.7.0 from
http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/windows-cpp-vs2008, visual studio 2009,
and windows XP SP3.  In cmake I have this:

   CMake Warning at CMakeLists.txt:97 (MESSAGE):
      Warning: You are using Qt 4.7.0.  Officially supported version is Qt 4.6

I don't think this can be the problem as the error isn't in any Qt
directories.

I also tried using the latest source via git using:

   git clone git://paraview.org/ParaView.git
   git submodule init
   git submodule update

but I got a similar message.

Does anyone have any clues please?

Thank you!

Matt Wilkins

How are your build/source directories organized? Is the source dir on the Z
drive and the build dir is on C?

Hi,

Yes, the source dir is on the Z drive and the build dir is on C.

My windows machine is running in virtualbox on my linux machine.  The
source directory, Z:, is a drive mapped through to a directory on my
linux box.  The build directory is C:/build/pv.

Thanks

Matt Wilkins

Hello!

Does anyone know, when ParaView 3.10 will be shipped, so that ParaView can also load CGNS data?

However, that's the branching date, not the release date. The binaries
may be 3-4 weeks after we branch.

Sorry, I didn't realize that the VTK submodule had been moved there, I fixed the problem a few hours later in VTK but ParaView was stuck with the broken test compilation. I will move it now.

  Phil,

It could be a bug but... I am unable to reproduce it myself using pv 
3.8.1. If it's not a bug then it could be confusion of how this feature 
works. just to verify could you try the following:

1) start pv
2) make a cone source with the default values
3) change the view noticeably: rotate, shift, move out, etc, etc ...
4) from the camera dialog, save the camera config
5) close pv
6) start a new pv
7) make a cone source
8) from the camera dialog, load the camera config you saved in step 4

I have just done these steps on my workstation with PV 3.8.1 and the 
view was restored with no problem. If you still experience the problem 
using the above steps you should file a bug report on 
http://www.paraview.org/Bug with details about your platform and steps 
to reproduce the situation.

Dear Takuya

Thanks for your infomation.
I created sphere and changed the interpolation tab.
I could  recognize the difference between flat and Gouraud.
Thank you very much.

Hi Ken,

Thank you for considerate replying.
Your e-mail is really helpful for me.
I understand that the calculation of rendering is different with?the
inside calculation of VTK.
And my case is the worst one.
So, I will try to interpolate the data before I import it in ParaVIew.
If I do , the contour  would  be more smooth.

Thank you,

Shinya Ogata

Hello!

I've now heard, that the Visit data base bridge is alread included in the actual version 3.8 and that 3.10 will ship an improved data base bridge version.
But there seems no entry of the data base bridge in the plug in manager or in the binary folders and Paraview still can't recognize CGNS. I fear, that in 3.10 it would be the same result.
So my question is: How can I activate the Visit data base bridge, if it's already included in 3.8?

Best regards

Michael Scheerer

All you need do is remove the Collection "unset" Grid from around the actual grid. You've created a collection of 1 temporal grid, hence the multiblock structure.

Dear John, Dear Paraview users,

after having been abroad for a couple of days and thus busy with other stuff, I returned to my visualization issue.
I've given one of your solutions a try and discarded unused blocks from my data set, sticking just with one block. Unfortunately this very naive approach doesn't work. I would guess I'm still having a multi-block with incorrect time stamps - just that the multi-block now consists of only one block.

I think I'll be able to modify the routines that create the xdmf data sets. But I would need some hints on how the data structure should actually look like in order to work as expected.
Looking at the xmf-File (see attachments for full example) my data is now organized like this:
<Grid Name="euclidean position" GridType="Collection" CollectionType="Unset">
      <Grid Name="Event 1" GridType="Collection" CollectionType="Temporal">
        <Grid Name="Frame 1" GridType="Uniform">
          <Topology Name="Topology" TopologyType="Polyvertex" Dimensions="629"/>
          <Geometry Name="Geometry" GeometryType="XYZ">
            <DataItem NumberType="Float" Precision="4" Dimensions="629 3" Format="HDF">trajectoryTest2.h5:/Case/Event 1/Frame 1/euclidean position</DataItem>
          </Geometry>
          <Time TimeType="Single" Value="0.2"/>
          <Attribute Name="azimuthal angle" AttributeType="Scalar" Center="Node">
            <DataItem NumberType="Float" Precision="4" Dimensions="629" Format="HDF">trajectoryTest2.h5:/Case/Event 1/Frame 1/azimuthal angle</DataItem>
          </Attribute>
..............
So, to me it looks as though I've got a temporal collection and inside of this there are grids called "Frame x" with each of these representing one time step. The "Frame"-grid is stamped with a time as above (<Time TimeType="Single" Value="0.2"/>) and contains several points XYZ with some assigned attributes.
How should the structure look like in order to work as expected (and discussed below)? Should there be a time stamp associated with the temporal collection grid one level above?
Or is there a deeper problem with the information stored in the h5 file?

Thank you guys so much for helping me on this one. I really appreciate it!


Cheers,
Oliver

I think, I'll go with solution 2 and try modifying our converter such

that it outputs the blocks to separate files. Or rather, in a first

attempt, I will simply discard blocks 2 through 5 completely, since I

don't really need this information right now anyway.

Oliver

Oliver,



I received your files (off list) and gave them a try. I see now what the problem is.



You've got a temporal collection, and inside this, is a multi-block set of particles. What is happening is that the pathline filter is being called once per block by the executive, but the DATA_TIME_STEPS key is stamped on the multi-block wrapper, and each time the pathline filter is executed on a sub-block, the sub-block is extracted from the collection and passed in - without - the DATA_TIME_STEPS key stamped on it.



Now this is fixable in two ways.

1) Have the executive stamp the sub-blocks with the wrapper's TIME key as they are extracted and passed in.

2) Have the Xdmf reader stamp the sub-blocks as they are generated (easier to do IMHO).



BUT.



Even if we make one of these fixes, I suspect the pathline filter will fail. This is because the pathline filter caches particle positions (w.r.t time) each time it is executed and builds a trail for each particle ID. If it is looped over a multiblock dataset - the executive reuses the same copy of the pathline filter for each block - so the pathline filter will get highly confused as it receives 5 executions for each time step - and the ID's present will be also occur 5 times (assuming you have Ids from 0-N for each block, if you have 0-5N and they are not duplicated, then it might just be OK).



Anyway. This is a serious problem as the pathline filter won't operate on the multiblock data. I'll add this to my list of 'one day I must fix this' - actually, I will soon need to use the pathline filter on multiblock data myself, so this is a good heads-up that I need to do something.



Here are ideas -



Solution 1: Doesn't work. If you use Extract-Block filter in ParaView, it just creates a new multiblock dataset with the unwanted blocks removed - it doesn't solve the problem of the sub-block stamping, you'd still need to fix 2) above in the reader. I have my own vtkFlattenDataset Filter (similar to extract blocks but removes the multiblock hierarchy) which I tried and it does work (for one block, but I didn't check for multiple to see if Ids are reused across blocks as my filter appends the datasets if >1 are taken). Unfortunately, this filter is not very well tested so not safe for public consumption.



Solution 2: If you can you split your blocks into separate Xdmf files so that you load 5 files instead of 1 (sorry, this is painful), then all will be ok. _This will at least work_



Solution 3: I could add multiblock support for the pathline filter, but this would take a spare afternoon/day which I don't have right now.



If I think of a solution 4, I'll post again.

Oliver



The Xdmf file (or reader) must be not handling the time properly, can you send (or ftp if big) me xdmf and hdf files and I'll have a look at it. I use the pathline filter extensively and know it works ok.

Subject: [Paraview] Particle trajectories with Paraview - How to to use an existing dataset (xml / hdf5) - error messages with "Particle Pathlines"



Dear Paraview users,



I know that this topic has probably been discussed a couple of times.

But so far I haven't been able to get find any real solutions from the

discussion threads to my specific problem. I'm afraid I will need a

detailed dummy / newbie explanation..





What I would like to do:

----------------------------------------



Plot the trajectory of a moving particle, i.e. trace its path with some

sort of line. The position of the particle is given as x,y,z coordinates

(euclidean position) at certain distinct time steps.

The ability to fade out the track after n time steps would be nice. And

of course I need more than one particle, but that doesn't really matter.





The data format I have:

----------------------------------------



I'm using a converter written by someone else to convert the output of

my simulations to a format that is understood by paraview. In principle

I do have the source code of this converter, but I haven't really

bothered to look into it yet (and don't really have the time to do so now).

The output I get from this converter is hdf5, i.e. a xml file and a .h5

file. The data is organized in frames, one frame per time step. See

below for an excerpt from my xml file.



In principle this dataset just holds the positions and momenta of point

like particles (plus some more scalar values) at given time steps.







What I've done so far / Error messages:

--------------------------------------



Loading this dataset (the xml file) into paraview works fine. It

displays all the points and animating is no problem. Each frame is

correctly associated with the actual time (as denoted in the xml file)

and I can loop through the time steps to see the particles evolve,

inspect scalar properties with glyphs and so on.



But how can I get the trajectory of a particle? Or rather the polyline

connecting the coordinate points the particle has passed at the given

time steps.



I've tried using the "Particle Pathlines" filter but it gives me error

messages like



 "vtkCompositeDataPipeline (0x5c93630): Algorithm

vtkTemporalPathLineFilter(0x54ff590) returned failure for request:

vtkInformation (0x55b9160)"



for Paraview 3.6.2 or



"vtkTemporalPathLineFilter (0x4b7a680): The input dataset did not have a

valid DATA_TIME_STEPS information key"

and

"vtkCompositeDataPipeline (0x4b7c0c0): Algorithm

vtkTemporalPathLineFilter(0x4b7a680) returned failure for request:

vtkInformation"



for Paraview 3.8.0









I would be very glad if you had some suggestions!



Cheers,

Oliver

In the 3.8 releases it is available in the Windows 32 bit, Linux 32 bit and
Linux 64 bit binaries and does have cgns support. If you download any of
those three binaries you should see it in the plugin manager under the tools
menu. The plugin is listed as VisItReaderPlugin.

Just to clarify, ParaView 3.8 shipped with an implementation version
of the visit-bridge for a few platforms. However we realized that this
version was very complicated to build and deploy. Also since then
Visit underwent changes notably adopting CMake. So we decided on
another edition of the Visit-bridge. Since 3.8  we have been working
on another revision  which is dramatically different from the one
released with 3.8. This v2 bridge will be available with 3.10.
Currently you can try it out using the git-repo Robert mentioned.

Hope that helps.

Hi Burlen,

Thanks for your reply.  I think I've sorted things out now based on your
reply.  First of all, I wasn't aware of a new version (I was using
v3.8.0) and so I've downloaded that.  I don't think that was the problem
though.

I've been playing around with the saving of the camera settings and have
now found that it works fine so long as I have the 'Use Parallel
Projection' turned off in the View Settings.  I can save a view, exit
and read in the same or a different case and it all works fine.

If I save a view when 'Use Parallel Projection' is turned on and then
exit, re-read etc then the camera settings do not work and whilst the
re-loaded view is correctly orientated, the zoom is all wrong.  Turning
'Use Parallel Projection' on and off does not fix this.

My platform is AMD 64bit running openSuse 11.1 but I get the same
problem on Windows 32bit.  I'm not sure if this is a bug or if it just
hasn't been coded to work with parallel projection.

Regards,

Phil

  Phil,

It could be a bug but... I am unable to reproduce it myself using pv
3.8.1. If it's not a bug then it could be confusion of how this feature
works. just to verify could you try the following:

1) start pv
2) make a cone source with the default values
3) change the view noticeably: rotate, shift, move out, etc, etc ...
4) from the camera dialog, save the camera config
5) close pv
6) start a new pv
7) make a cone source
8) from the camera dialog, load the camera config you saved in step 4

I have just done these steps on my workstation with PV 3.8.1 and the
view was restored with no problem. If you still experience the problem
using the above steps you should file a bug report on
http://www.paraview.org/Bug with details about your platform and steps
to reproduce the situation.

The manta view plugin has not yet been updated to work within the new view
framework that Utkarsh committed a week or so ago. We are working on
restoring it and hope to have it back before 3.10.

Ok thanks.  I noticed quite big changes to view - I'm just about to find out
if all my old plugins work...

Just out of interest, is it a good idea to be using the git master?

Phil,

It is a bug after all. Would you mind filing a report?

http://www.paraview.org/Bug

these steps can be used to reproduce.

1) start pv
2) enable parallel projection
3) make a cone source with the default values
4) change the view noticeably: rotate, shift, move out, etc, etc ...
5) from the camera dialog, save the camera config
6) close pv
7) start a new pv
8) make a cone source
9) from the camera dialog, load the camera config you saved in step 4

thanks
Burlen

There are tradeoffs to using the leading edge or latest stable release of
any project.

With leading edge you get the latest bug fixes but also the latest bugs.

Likewise you get features as soon as they appear but if you are writing code
you have to deal with the way features change more rapidly. Although a pain
at times, that is actually good because it gives you advanced warning about
what needs to be changed before the next release

Lastly, although we try our best to keep master stable with dashboards and
such, some days the code is just broken. The new branchy workflow should
significantly help with that.

As for today the dashboards aren't in great shape but ParaView appears to be
working for the most part.

Mandelbrot source was overloaded when I loaded PointSprite plugin
in paraview 3.8.1. I saw two Mandelbrot sources in the menu Sources
when I loaded it. It may cause some confusion in paraview.

In PointSprite_Rendering.xml, the class vtkImageSpriteSource was
labeled Mandelbrot.

I don't know the reason why the class had to labeled Mandelbrot,
but i think it would be better for the class to use other name
instead of Mandelbrot or to change ProxyGroup name in which the
class belongs from "sources" to "internal_filters".

Thanks,
Isamu

This is an error introduced by some cut'n'paste that clearly didn't quite get cleaned up properly. If it's not already fixed on the main branch, I'll take a look at it. The point sprite plugin needs a bit of work - I've been having trouble with it too recently.

Subject: [Paraview] Volume rendering vtkStructuredPoints
Message-ID: <AANLkTinHbtqg34u2e7_nV7bn-k-x4ZUryhscqYKMap-x@mail.gmail.com>

I used a vtkProbeFilter to resample an unstructured grid dataset onto a
vtkStructuredPoints, which I then tried to volume render in Paraview. The
result is attached. Paraview seems to be ignoring the vtkValidPointMask and
instead rendering every point whether it is valid or not. Is there some way
to get Paraview to exclude invalid points from the volume rendering?

Try using a conditional expression in the calculator to set the invalid
values to some slightly off range value. Then edit the color map to make
that off range value completely transparent.

Message-ID: <AB48A31C4EC97E498F4235B7CEF74A194D49CBB658@MBX00.d.ethz.ch>

    Hi all

I have the following definition for a home-made reader where I wish to pass 5 integers back to my python client.

 <IntVectorProperty
       name="Windices"
       command="GetWindices"
       number_of_elements="5"
       default_values="0 0 0 0 0"
       information_only="1">
       <SimpleIntInformationHelper/>
     </IntVectorProperty>

The problem I have with both version 3.8.1 and 3.9 is that the auto-generated code gets written as:

  if (!strcmp("GetWindices",method) && msg.GetNumberOfArguments(0) == 2)
    {
    int     *temp20;
      {
      temp20 = (op)->GetWindices();
      resultStream.Reset();
      resultStream << vtkClientServerStream::Reply << vtkClientServerStream::InsertArray(temp20,4) << vtkClientServerStream::End;
      return 1;
      }
    }

i.e with an InsertArray(temp20,4) instead of what I wish to see, an InsertArray(temp20,5);
5, because I wish to pass an array of 5 values. If I modify the auto-generated code and replace 4 by 5, everything works inside my Python shell as expected.

Have I made an error in my XML code, such that the auto-generated code fails to give me what I expect?

TIA

The wrapper auto-generated code is not related to the xml stuff at
all. The wrapper thinks it's expecting a 4-tuple as the return value
from GetWindices. Have you specified a "hints" file for this class so
that this method gets wrapped? If so you will have to fix the hints
file to indicate the return value is a 5-tuple. If not, what's the
signature of GetWindices in your header file?

If I load cgns files with vector fields and own defined field names, no vector visualisation representation is possible. All vector components are treated like single scalar fields.
Is it, because of the self defined non CGNS standard field names or is it a non implement feature of the CGNS data base bridge?
Or should I grouped the 2-3 scalar fields to one vector field? And how?

You can use the calculator to group arrays together to make a vector field.
Assuming the three arrays are labelled "X", "Y", and "Z" the expressions is
X*iHat+Y*jHat+Z*kHat.

I have the same "No native data type can represent a 64-bit integer"
on the latest git (20 minutes ago) paraview and cmake-2.8.3_rc1 under
windows and 64 bit visual studio 2008. I will try to nuke the build

Oops. Sorry. I messed up the search. I thought this was a paraview thread..

Subject: [Paraview] Temporal integration
Message-ID: <20101025211549.85735xgyhkcz5gth@horde.vki.ac.be>

Hello,

  I would like to ask if ParaView can integrate in time. My dataset  
comes from a time-dependent CFD simulation. I sliced the geometry and  
computed some (integral) quantities on this slice. In other words,  
there's one scalar value associated with the sliced plane at every  
time step. It would help me if I could integrate these scalars as  
time-dependent variables since I need a time-averaged value as well.  
Is this possible?

  Thank you.

Best regards,

    Martin Vymazal

I can't think of a filter that does that, but there is no reason it could not be implemented with the temporal extensions to the VTK pipeline.

Or you could try using the existing plot over time filter to extract a time series over one or more points in a field.  You could then integrate the curve it returns.  Perhaps the integrate attributes filter will do it.  Or maybe not; I don't know how it behaves with 1D data.

comes from a time-dependent CFD simulation. I sliced the geometry and
computed some (integral) quantities on this slice. In other words,
there's one scalar value associated with the sliced plane at every
time step. It would help me if I could integrate these scalars as
time-dependent variables since I need a time-averaged value as well.
Is this possible?

  Thank you.

Best regards,

    Martin Vymazal

Hi I have pulled the latest changes from GIT.
For some reason the surface LIC behaves differently now :

vtkSurfaceLICPainter (0x417a540): No polydata input!

I am generating slices on a multiblock dataset. This used to work without a
problem, is there something new that needs to be done ?

Thanks,

Hi,

In the calculator, you can see all the components of the vectors (in the
scalars list). You can use the iHat, jHat and kHat vectors too.
Then you should be able to calculate "manually" the cross product.

And although there is no button for it, the standard calulcator will
evaluate cross products if you type the expression in manually.

The full list of expressions the calculator knows about are (from
vtkFunctionParser.cxx)
static char funcNames[NUMBFUNCS][10] = {
   "abs(",  "exp(",   "ceil(", "floor(",
   "ln(",   "log10(", "log(",  "sqrt(",

Hey all,
I'm experiencing issues with the calculator filter. Basically I'm trying 
to create local_entropy_generation_rate=F(turbulent_viscosity 
,space_derivatives_of_velocity_components) and I keep getting some kind of 
error in vtkArrayCalculator.cxx, line 305, like  "Invalid array name: 
VectorGradient" or "Invalid array name: TurbVisc".

I tried messing around with the cell-to-point or point-to-cell data 
filters but it did not help. My initial input is one single CFD dataset 
created by Code_Saturne. I can display the turbulent viscosity and the 
derivatives of the velocity field as I wish, but I don't manage to use the 
array data to create my entropy function...

Any clue?

Thanks!
JB

You can use the 'ComputeDerivatives' filter and select 'Vorticity' as the
output vector type.

The Gradient of Unstructured DataSet does provide a vorticity computation
option but as the filter's name implies, it is only valid for grids that

Message-ID: <F5B3BE9B-1212-4374-918D-C3DC5B0047C3@indiana.edu>

Hi all,

I'm trying to evaluate ParaView (3.8.1) as a possible framework/app for a tool we're trying to build (standalone, not client/server).  Our tool will primarily vis only static 2D ImageData.  We would like the ability to select a region of the ImageData, e.g. select an entire row, and have an X-Y plot be displayed in another window.  So, in this use case, one window (ImageData) remains static, but as a new row is selected, another window (plot/chart) is dynamically updated.  I'd welcome pointers to docs/examples and suggestions.

I did see this thread on widgets:  
http://paraview.markmail.org/search/?q=mouse+event#query:mouse%20event+page:1+mid:iqhyx3k4ik6sk5ue+state:results

and I was also playing around with the Selection Inspector.  However it seems that this only works with a 3D window(?) which is actually something I'd like to avoid, in terms of the freedom to rotate the ImageData about X or Y.

thanks, Randy

When I have a collection of files named

Paraview lets me open the name_*.vpt file and it sets each one as a separate

However, if I read a name_*.mhd, it seems to not do the same thing - only
the first image in the series is displayed throughout. Is there a way to get
this to happen?

Using the new sortable spreadsheet view (which is great!), it is very easy
to find the maximum value in an image. Is there a way to highlight the
pixels that are selected in the spreadsheet view (as you can highlight the
points that are selected if the data is a polydata, etc)?

It seems that you're using wrong names.

The name of the only data that you can use in the formulas are available
under the buttons "scalars" and "vectors" in the calculator filter.
If you don't see anything, no variables is stored at the points of your
dataset.

You can see the data stored at the center of cells by into the information
tab.

ParaView developpers,

are the dashboards run from their build directories, or from the installed directories?

the reason I ask is that for several days now, I can build at 100%, but  "make install" fails with errors like:

I'll take a look Jean, BundleUtilities is something added late last week.
Can you send all of the output from make install? I think somewhere in it,
it complains what library it had a problem.

Randy,

The 2D view by default uses a texture-based mapper for rendering the
image slice. We haven't implemented the selection capability yet for
this mapper (the same is true if you use slice representation in the
3D view). What is your time frame for this application? Maybe we can
fast track adding support for selecting on image slices. An
alternative is to create a frustum selection and that should work even
in 2D view with slices.

In the spreadsheet view there is a list of all of the indices of the
points in the image along with their associated value (scalar or
vector). When you select rows in the spreadsheet, nothing changes in
the image. I am looking to turn points in the image associated with
the selected rows pink or something like that (as is done with
polydata).

I hope this clarifies what I am trying to do.

Ah you're talking of 2D view. Yup, that's a missing feature. Can you
add a bug to the bug tracker please? You should see the points in 3D
view, however.

following:

Should we really be running BundleUtilities for a normal make install?

The installation of third party libraries (by BundleUtilities) is controlled
by PARAVIEW_INSTALL_THIRD_PARTY_LIBRARIES, which is default OFF. I can
most certainly turn it OFF (especially for Linux) by default. That will
result in no Qt, FFMPEG, Python, etc libraries being installed in
<blah>/lib/paraview-3.x. If you don't have Qt (for example) in usr/lib
though, you will have to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH appropriately.

Anyone object to PARAVIEW_INSTALL_THIRD_PARTY_LIBRARIES being defaulted to
OFF on Linux?

You're right, it works as expected in the 3D view.

Time frame?  I'm an academic.  And you're offering free, open source software. :)  Let's just say +1 to a request list.

But beyond the selection functionality, is there some way to (dynamically) connect the selection to update a 2-D plot?  I can (sort of) already select a row in my ImageData, if I use a 3D view (http://mypage.iu.edu/~heiland/pv-stuff/).  But is there some magic to connect that selection to a port, that triggers an update to a plot window, etc?

So what are you plotting in the plot view? Directly the data that's
being selected or are you applying some other filter and then that's
shown in the plot view?

Can you create your pipeline/view setup in ParaView itself and send me
the screenshot. That will clarify the pipelines you're using.

Turning  PARAVIEW_INSTALL_THIRD_PARTY_LIBRARIES to OFF fixes my install issue. Thanks for the tip.

btw, is there any reason the hdf5 libs get installed in /fullpath/lib instead of /fullpath/lib/paraview-3.9? There are the only libs being installed one level up (from the rest).

Thanks
Jean

I think turning this OFF by default is the way to go.

Hi,

I am driving paraview via pvpython, and trying to do a probe over
line.  I would think this is quite easy, but it is proving
frustratingly difficult!  This is what I am typing

from paraview import servermanager
c = servermanager.Connect()
reader = servermanager.sources.XMLUnstructuredGridReader(FileName =
"/var/tmp/file.vtu")
pl = servermanager.filters.ProbeLine(Input = reader)
pl.Source.Point1 = [-7000, -5000, 0]
pl.Source.Point2 = [4300, 6300, 1111.75]
view = servermanager.CreateRenderView()
rep = servermanager.CreateRepresentation(pl, view)
pl.UpdatePipeline()
view.ResetCamera()
view.StillRender()

I get a nice picture of the x axis and a short y axis, but nothing
plotted.  I try a probe over line in paraview with the same beginning
and end points and I get data displayed.

I am not specifying what variables should be displayed for the probe
over line, so perhaps nothing is getting displayed?  I cannot for the
life of me find how I would specify what to display though.  If I do a
probe over line in paraview with the Python Shell Trace running, I can
see that the SeriesVisibility attribute in the
paraview.servermanager.XYChartRepresentation object is being set.
However I don't have that representation, I only have the 'rep' above,
and that doesn't have a SeriesVisibility attribute.

Thank you for any help, even if it is a pointer to where this is
documented!

Matt

Thanks! I was hoping it was out there in HTML format somewhere (probably I
could generate that myself from the python sources), but
help(paraview.simple) gets me the information I need.

What version of ParaView are you using? Here's my script with 3.9
(should work with 3.8 too).

Wavelet()
pl = PlotOverLine()
pl.Source.Point1 = [-10, -10, -10]
pl.Source.Point2 = [10, 10, 10]
CreateXYPlotView()
Show()
Render()

Hi,

    I have a chance to re-test all the HDF5 and XDMF files with Paraview 
3.8.1 on Ubuntu 10.04 64bit.

    No problems at all.

    So all my issues with using XDMF to display HDF5 is a problem with 
the build of Paraview 3.8.1 on OSX 10.5 (PPC)

    Thank you for the tip on structuring XDMF files.

Regards

Hi Utkarsh,

Thanks, I am using 3.9, but I wasn't using paraview.simple, just
following the examples in the Python Scripting chapter in the ParaView
Guide.  Using paraview.simple does make things simpler ;-)  and indeed
I can get it to work.

For the record this works fine for me:

from paraview.simple import *
reader = servermanager.sources.XMLUnstructuredGridReader(FileName = "/var/tmp/file.vtu")
pl = PlotOverLine(Input = reader)
pl.Source.Point1 = [-7000, -5000, 0]
pl.Source.Point2 = [4300, 6300, 1111.75]
CreateXYPlotView()
d = Show()
d.XArrayName = 'arc_length'
d.SeriesVisibility = ['namecolours (0)', '0', 'namecolours (1)', '0', 'namecolours (2)', '0', 'vtkValidPointMask', '0', 'arc_length', '0']
d.UseIndexForXAxis = 0
Render()

OK, so got past this problem, more to come I expect!

Thank you

Matt Wilkins

Hi,

As promised, I have another question!

The code below can render a picture to the screen fine.  But I would
like to send the picture to a file, without rendering anything to the
screen.  I know I can put
   WriteImage('/tmp/foo.png')
at the end to save the output, but that is after I've popped up an
image.

I did find a powerpoint by David E DeMarle about paraview scripting
with this in it:

writer = servermanager.writers.PNGWriter()
writer.FileName = '/tmp/foo.png'
writer.Input = pl
writer.UpdatePipeline()

But when I try that I get:
ERROR: In /scratch/pv/ParaView/VTK/IO/vtkPNGWriter.cxx, line 54
vtkPNGWriter (0xb108028): Write:Please specify an input!
which is odd since I thought I had set the input via writer.Input = pl

My full code was

from paraview.simple import *
reader = servermanager.sources.XMLUnstructuredGridReader(FileName = "/var/tmp/file.vtu")
pl = PlotOverLine(Input = reader)
pl.Source.Point1 = [-7000, -5000, 0]
pl.Source.Point2 = [4300, 6300, 1111.75]
writer = servermanager.writers.PNGWriter()
writer.FileName = '/tmp/foo.png'
writer.Input = pl
c = CreateXYPlotView()
d = Show()
d.XArrayName = 'arc_length'
d.SeriesVisibility = ['namecolours (0)', '0', 'namecolours (1)', '0',
'namecolours (2)', '0', 'vtkValidPointMask', '0', 'arc_length', '0']
d.UseIndexForXAxis = 0
writer.UpdatePipeline()

I feel pretty bad about always asking questions on this list, but I
just can't seem to find documentation, or if I do, it is for a
slightly different setup (as in David E DeMarle's powerpoint for
instance).  So, if I am just missing some good doco source, please
point me that way!

Thanks for any help!

Hi Matt,

By quickly reading your code, I understand that you try to put
the ouput of the PlotOverLine on the the input of an image writer.
The mistake, IMHO, is that PlotOverLine outputs a vtkPolyData
(Polygonal Mesh in ParaView), that's why the writer doesn't want it as
input (it expects a vtkImageData instead).

I think that what you want is a screenshot of the plot. You should look
in that direction. Sort of "Offscreen screenshot" ?? Don't know...

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview and temporal data set cache
Message-ID: <400207.57542.qm@web29719.mail.ird.yahoo.com>

Hello,

I develop a reader that process a format describing geometry, attributes and 
temporals data.  When I load a file in paraview and that I ask for a specific 
time step, I can trace the call and I see that a RequestData is done.  So, for 
each request data, my output contains the geometry, the attributes and temporal 
data for the asked time step.
But, when in Paraview I have asked for all time steps, there is no more call to 
RequestData in my reader plugin.  

I guess that Paraview has a temporal Data Set cache implementation. 

Am I right ?

Thank you.

I can ask my self. I have just discover that we can set the cache geometry cache 
in the Paraview Edit/Settings.
Sorry for the inconvenience.

Subject: [Paraview] Error importing numpy [Windows]
Message-ID: <OF26720D5B.2ED6DC60-ON852577CB.00585262-852577CB.005A35DA@CHROMALLOY.COM>

I'm attempting to use an existing installation of numpy in Paraview on 
Windows. I installed Paraview from a binary installer onto Windows. 
Paraview installed it's own Python version without numpy. I tried 
appending the path to an existing numpy installation on the computer to 
the PYTHONPATH within the Paraview Python shell, but I cannot import numpy 
(see Python shell traceback):

ImportError: DLL load failed: %1 is not a valid Win32 application.

Both the Paraview and Windows Python versions are 2.6. Any ideas on how to 
proceed?

How do I select a volume mapper from the python API? I want to use
raycasting rather than the default projected tetrahedra.

You can use the following:

DataRepresentation1.SelectMapper = 'GPU'
