Hi all,

I have a pvbatch script from which I would like to get the output data 
set of the second output port of a filter which has 2 output ports. How 
can I do this?

Subject: [Paraview] two questions
Message-ID: <200809012319045000581@gmail.com>



         hi everyone, during the practising of paraview, I have two questions.

          
         one, when using Windows XP as the client, I want to connect the Linux based culster as server.

       
          I tried it , if I choose to launch the linux server mannuly, then connect to the server throgh paraview GUI on Windows, it worked well.

          But, as we know, paraview could launch the server through command type, no need to launch the server before connecting.

         This time ,  I failed, for the linux rufused it , how to avoid this ?


         It seemed not because of the firewall.

          ====================================================


         the other one , I want to show some logos during the launch of pvserver on the server , how to custom the source code, could somome give

         some suggestions ??

         =======================================================



          ok, thanks, waiting for the answers.

Yeah. We will track it down at one point. It has been a low priority
since it is harmless (I guess not entirely since it is confusing).

Just committed a fix to ParaView to add an optional argument 'idx' to

I am not seeing that behavior in either the 3.2 release or the CVS version.  As far as I can tell, ParaView is correctly requesting a single time step from the pipeline.  If you have other filters, it is possible that some of them are requesting multiple time steps.  It is also possible to get "thrashing" behavior if you have a branching pipeline and the branches are requesting different time steps.

Message-ID: <C9C5F90AF4778B449CF1FC5A9BD9148905F00E@sbsserver.DigitalFlowSolutions.local>

Dear Paraview people,

            I am working with Paraview with very large datasets (around
40Gb). I have written a filter derived from MeshQuality which doesn't
seem to display the returned data arrays correctly. I checked with the
same mesh and the MeshQuality filter. The same thing happens: I put the
output on volume rendering to look at the quality field and the whole
dataset is invisible. I have tried rescaling the range but to know
avail. Is this a known problem?

Any advice? With smaller meshes the problem disappears and the quality
field is visible with volume rendering.

Are you sure that pvserver is being launched correctly?  It could be that
whatever command you gave to ParaView to launch the remote pvserver
executable is not correct.  If pvserver was launched properly, you should
see that after the failed connect there is still a pvserver running and
waiting for the client to connect (and you should be able to connect
manually).

If pvserver is being launched correctly, then the problem is probably that
the client is not waiting long enough to connect.  That is, the client tries
to connect to the server before the server is completely launched and
waiting for connections.  Try increasing the delay before connecting to the
server or get around the whole problem by doing a reverse connect.

You could modify ParaView3/Executables/pvserver.cxx to make a splash screen
and then delete it before it calls vtkPVMain::Run.  However, pvserver
launches fast enough where you the splash screen would flash to fast to
actually see.  You could add a delay to keep the splash screen up longer,
but that would be more annoying than useful.

Indeed, it is a pipeline: cut, calculator, surface vectors and two streamline 
filters at the end. Requesting specific time steps results in going through 
all the intermediate steps, which can take a very long time.

However! This seems to only happen AFTER an animation was generated (as png 
images). So likely something is broken here. Can someone confirm please?

If your mesh is typical, then probably most of the cells are of good quality, and there are a handful of cells of bad quality.  Thus, when volume rendering most of the cells will be invisible and that handful of cells will have some opacity.

The probable reason that you can see them in a small mesh and not a large one is that the cells are spatially much smaller (with respect to the entire mesh) for the large mesh.  In correct volume rendering, a material of a constant density will have smaller opacity the thinner it gets.  Your cells are probably so small that there is not enough accumulation to actually see them.

You can adjust for the small scale of the cells by adjusting the "Scale" parameter in the Color Scale Editor dialog box.  That parameter is actually a unit length specification for the opacity parameters given.  Setting it to about cell length divided by 10 should give you decent results.  However, an easier and probably more effective approach would be to bag the volume rendering and use the threshold filter to extract the cells of interest (in this case, the bad ones).

Message-ID: <48BD4894.9000605@nacad.ufrj.br>

(...now I'm pretty sure that the problem is not version mismatch ;o)  )

I'm trying to run a client x server reverse connection between an 
Altix-ICE(server/offscreen rendering) and a Windows XP laptop.

The scenario is:

-- ParaView 3 CVS's HEAD (I updated both, client and server, today)
On Windows side, I've compiled using VS2005 (Qt 4.3.4);
On SUSE's side, I've used mvapich 1.0.3, SGI's Mesa 6.4.2;

-- The connection setup is:
On the client side: reverse connection manually configured;
On the server side: I used the following torque's script to launch the 
pvserver:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Torque's script (just the most relevant parts)

export 
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:/absolute/path/to/paraview/lib/directory/

mpiexec -n ${NUM_PROC} /absolute/path/to/paraview/bin/directory/pvserver 
--use-offscreen-rendering -rc -ch=Windows.Laptop.Ip
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Launching procedure:
I've let the client waiting and submitted the paraview's job script. The 
Torque started my job (RUN STATUS), and the following message echoed on 
the client's screen:

probably using mismatching versions of client and server.

If I try to ping Windows.Laptop.Ip from the server, it's there:

My guess is that something is wrongly configured, but I can figure it 
out. Does ParaView have any kind of verbose mode where I could track 
down where the problem is?

None of the filters you mention should effect the pipeline time and I still cannot replicate your problem.  I was using the exodus reader, so it could be a problem with whatever reader you are using.  Perhaps you could add breakpoints to the RequestInformation and RequestData methods to see check the times being requested.

I guess I found the problem. The Altix-ICE's nodes can't ping outside 
(the test I had done in the first email was using the service node).

If I try:
rsh r1i0n0 ping Windows.Laptop.Ip
the command returns:
118 packets transmitted, 0 received, 100% packet loss, time 117007ms

Hey Paraview Community,

I'm having problems in setting a paraview writer to work.

A friend of mine has programmed a writer, and in his machine it compiles and
works fine. He sent me the source code and I managed to cmake it and to
compile it, with MS Visual Studio 2005 and pointing to a Paraview 3.2.3
distribution in my computer. I've already set my environment variable
PV_PLUGIN_PATH to a folder called ParaviewPlugins, where I put all the dll's
of the plugins which I want to load with Paraview. When I open the program,
I go to the option "Manage Plugins..." in "Tools", and can see all the
plugins whose dll's are in the ParaviewPlugins folder, including my writer.
Every other plugin is working just fine, but I can't manage to save a file
in the extension specified in my writer's code.

Does anybody have an idea of what's going on ? I

Hello Rafael,

Did you compile paraview from the source?

Thank you for your help,

I successfully used (without parentheses)

ifndef NDEBUG

to detect release build.

I've never seen that before.  You could try deleting the user settings file.  It is located at

C:\Documents and Settings\<username>\Application Data\ParaView\ParaView3.2.ini

The user settings have a nasty habit of sticking around even after doing a reinstall of ParaView.  I can't think of anything specifically in there that would cause your problems, but it's worth trying.

Thanks for a hint, but how do you explain that the problem happens only after 
an animation has been generated? It does not occur before, a frame is reached 
in one precise jump.  --Dominik

I am a bit confused.  The initial question sounded like a volume rendering problem; you could not see the result of the mesh quality filter very well.  Is the problem you are reporting that the output of the mesh quality filter is incorrect?  Do the ranges look wrong in the information tab?  Does the threshold filter not extract cells you expect to be of poor quality?

Does your modified mesh quality filter behave differently than the one that comes with ParaView?  The pipeline should not be updating your filter unless it needs to refresh the calculation.  The mesh quality filter will be run multiple times on multiblock data (once per block), but I assume that is not the case for you as volume rendering is not available on data with more than one block.  The cell count might be off because you are running in parallel.  Each process will have a partition of the whole mesh, so the cell count will be smaller unless you are getting the global multiprocess controller and adding up all the cells.

If the pipeline is inappropriately calling your filter multiple times, it might be that your filter is calling its own Modified method (usually indirectly through, for example, a call to one of the Set* macros).  You can check for that by making sure that the MTime ivar does not change while invoking RequestData or any other ProcessRequests method.

Dear Ken,
    Thanks for your answer but I am not sure that this is the reason as I have other fields which have large values. If I count the number of cells in one pass through vtkMeshQuality and output to a file, I find that the answer is far less than the actual number of cells in the mesh. I have a gut feeling that because the mesh is so big that the MeshQuality filter is entered several times as it updates the progress bar, wouldn't that mean that the newly created quality arrays are overwritten each time the filter is entered? I'm not too sure about how the filters actually work.
How is this prevented?

Thanks
Nat.

Subject: RE: Strange behaviour with large datasets

If your mesh is typical, then probably most of the cells are of good quality, and there are a handful of cells of bad quality.  Thus, when volume rendering most of the cells will be invisible and that handful of cells will have some opacity.

The probable reason that you can see them in a small mesh and not a large one is that the cells are spatially much smaller (with respect to the entire mesh) for the large mesh.  In correct volume rendering, a material of a constant density will have smaller opacity the thinner it gets.  Your cells are probably so small that there is not enough accumulation to actually see them.

You can adjust for the small scale of the cells by adjusting the "Scale" parameter in the Color Scale Editor dialog box.  That parameter is actually a unit length specification for the opacity parameters given.  Setting it to about cell length divided by 10 should give you decent results.  However, an easier and probably more effective approach would be to bag the volume rendering and use the threshold filter to extract the cells of interest (in this case, the bad ones).

Dear Paraview people,
            I am working with Paraview with very large datasets (around 40Gb). I have written a filter derived from MeshQuality which doesn't seem to display the returned data arrays correctly. I checked with the same mesh and the MeshQuality filter. The same thing happens: I put the output on volume rendering to look at the quality field and the whole dataset is invisible. I have tried rescaling the range but to know avail. Is this a known problem?
Any advice? With smaller meshes the problem disappears and the quality field is visible with volume rendering.

Hi Ken,

 

"The mesh quality filter will be run multiple times on multiblock data
(once per block), but I assume that is not the case for you as volume
rendering is not available on data with more than one block."

 

I think this sentence sums up my problem: the unstructured grid does
indeed consist of multiblock data.

Ok thanks so much for your help. I will look for a different approach to
what I am trying to do.

 

Thanks for your time.

Nat.

Hi,

There are some features that I do not know if ParaView has. And if
not, I want to suggest them. I should note that I am a beginner with
using ParaView and the VTK pipeline.

1- The possibilty of rereading a data file, while keeping everything
else the same.

2- More facilities for zooming and panning:
a- A button for click and drag to select the region to zoom in.
b- Zooming in and out, taking the center for zooming the initial
location of the cursor, not the center of the view area. This is how
Gmsh (e.g.) works, and I find it most useful.

Best regards,

Santiago

Hi Everyone,

	Is there a way to get a better display of a mesh in Paraview? In
Windows and Linux, I get the following behavior on all my systems: the
attached Capture.jpg file shows the surface of a mesh (with edges also
drawn). Note that some of the occluded edges are "bleeding" into the
display. I have the same behavior regardless of the platform and graphics
card I use (the picture was taken on a system running Vista x64 with a
Quadro FX 4500 card).

	Thanks in advance,

			Gonzalo

You forgot to attach the image, but I think your report is the same as bug #6658.

  http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=6658

The issue is already resolved in the development repository and will be available in the next release of ParaView.

Keep the list informed as to what you find as more users are starting to

Subject: [Paraview] ExodusII data
Message-ID: <48BE4853.3000802@cscs.ch>

Does anyone have a more complex ExodusII dataset than the Can data in 
ParaViewData. I'd like to copy some of the features from the GUI panel, 
but  could do with some test data that has heirarchies of blocks etc. 
I'd like to expose a tree-like structure to allow the user to load only 
this/that block etc, I'm guessing the quickest approach will be to clone 
an existing reader implementation.

Thanks

JB

Does anybody know where the source-code for version 3.3.1 is? It's not

"ParaView-3-3-1"?

3.3 is a development version (because x.3 is odd), and we only
sporadically tag development versions. Since it is the _current_
development version, cvs update -dAP will grab what is up to date
right now.

Aggg.. Sorry about that. OS X Leopard. Qt 4.3.5, Debug build (Both).

Updated cvs a few minutes ago and saw the same issue, This time with  
some "standard" data:

Launch ParaView.
Create a Sphere Source
Apply the "Elevation" filter
Apple the Threshold filter. At this point I get the errors;

"QFormBuilder was unable to create a widget of the class  
'pqDoubleRangeWidget'."
"QFormBuilder was unable to create a widget of the class  
'pqDoubleRangeWidget'."
QObject::connect: Cannot connect (null)::valueEdited(double) to  
pqThresholdPanel::lowerChanged(double)
QObject::connect: Cannot connect (null)::valueEdited(double) to  
pqThresholdPanel::upperChanged(double)

And the UI is missing the text edit fields for the lower and upper  
bounds. ParaView will then crash if I go any further.

I'll attach the cmakecache.txt file for your review;

Mike

Did you do a make install of paraview?
Can you check the path in ParaView3/Qt/Core/pqFormBuilder.cpp line 47.  It 
needs the directory contianing the pqWidgets library.

No install. I am trying to run from the build directory by issuing the  
following command:

Bin/paraview.app/Contents/MacOS/paraview

Line 47 of that file (which ends in .cxx BTW) is the following:

this->addPluginPath( QCoreApplication::applicationDirPath() +  
"/../../../");

Which probably won't work for an installation if I understand things  
correctly. We could add:

     //Look in the Application Package "ParaView.app/Contents/plugins
     this->addPluginPath( QCoreApplication::applicationDirPath() +  
QDir::separator() + "../plugins;" );
     //Look for a folder called "plugins" at the same level as  
ParaView.app
     this->addPluginPath( QCoreApplication::applicationDirPath() +  
QDir::separator() + "../../../plugins;");

at that would allow for plugins to be loaded from other places, but  
then we are just looking for a particular plugin (pqWidgets) so that  
may not be necessary.

Also, when I try a "make install" the ParaView.app _never_ really gets  
created. I have not had time to troubleshoot this though.

Are you sure the qrc file got compiled into the plugin that shows up in your 
list of loaded plugins?

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview 3 and web portals....
Message-ID: <48BEAB74.A14A.0000.0@osc.edu>

I would like to clarify how we would like to use paraview in this fashion, in the hope that it might generate some response. Currently, there is a CFD course that is taught online. Parameters to a particular problem are entered in a web page and submitted for a run on our HPC cluster. Images of the solution are generated and supplied to the student through the web interface. The batch script runs a processed script generated from Paraview 2.6. We currently also have Paraview 3 installed on the cluster. 

We would like to have more flexibility in processing the images after the solution is submitted, i.e. switching the modes of the data, vector or scalar data, and panning and zooming on the images, and, subsequently, handled by the students in the web application. 

I hope this describes our intentions better. Would appreciate any feedback.

This happens for the same input files on both Windows and Linux versions

Speaking of (slightly :-) - any idea how close we are to the next "stable"

the expectation that we're fairly close.

Message-ID: <200809040918.17065.dominik@itis.ethz.ch>

I have a complicated layout of filters on the left panel. How do I go about 
saving them as a filter in PV CVS? (saving state does not work for transient, 
fixing number current time steps). I tried 'create a custom filter' but it is 
not comprehensive. I clicked around and ended up nowhere. Any hints are 
appreciated.
PS. I dd not find anything on wiki, and can again no longer find a search link 
to ML archives.

best regards

Subject: [Paraview] casting vtkPointData* to double*
Message-ID: <BAY122-W4877CDAADB19D170D3937BC590@phx.gbl>


Hi!
I?m writing a filter and I want to perform arithmetic operations, i.e. "+=" with the scalar data associated to each point of my grid. So I get the Point Data from the input file:

void vtkHorizontalAverage::Execute()
{vtkStructuredGrid *input = this->GetInput();
vtkStructuredGrid *output = this->GetOutput();

 vtkPointData *inPtr = input->GetPointData();
 vtkPointData *outPtr = output->GetPointData(); 
...

here and now I want to apply the += operator, but I have no idea how to cast my vtkPointData - object, since I do not really know where to fit the cast operator in, to the vtkPointData class or to the vtkDataArray.. 

I could also use a reinterpretcast, but I?m not sure if the format of the data in vtkPointData is double or float.. 

So, any help would be apreciated! 
thx,
NH

Subject: [Paraview] problems linking a new filter
Message-ID: <BAY122-W406EF120DAF31CACCC5ECCBC590@phx.gbl>


Hello,
I have written a new filter and put in the method New():

static vtkHorizontalAverage *New() {return new vtkHorizontalAverage;}

it is in the header-file vtkHorizontalAverage.h, HorizontalAverage is the new filter.
As there is already the definition there, there is nothing else concerning New() in the corresponding .cxx-file.

Now building paraview with that filter, it compiles fine, but linking I get the following error:

Linking CXX Executable ..\..\..\bin\ServerManagerStateLoader.exe:
..\bin\libvtkPVFilters.a(vtkPVFiltersInstantiator.obj):vtkPVFiltersInstantiator.cxx: undefined reference to 'vtkInstantiatorvtkHorizontalAverageNew() '

What can I do to avoid that? Is there any file I need to include additionally, or.. ?? 
thx for help,
NH

vtkPointData is a collection of arrays (for example temperature,
density, velocity), each of which may have multiple components (for
example VEL_X, VEL_Y, VEL_Z) and multiple tuples (the temperature at
the first point, the temperature at the second point, ..., the
temperature at the millionth point). vtkPointData::GetScalars() will
give you access to the currently active scalar array. You will then
have to get access to the raw pointer or use element indexing (both of
which are descibed in the vtkDataArray documentation) to do element
wise arithmetic. Lastly, you may want to look at the calculator
filter.

cheers,
Dave DeMarle

Thanks.
   I also tried to fix the tab order while I was looking around but  
nothing seems to work. I put the following code in the constructor for  
pqThresholdPanel.cxx:

   QWidget::setTabOrder(this->UI->SelectInputScalars, this->UI- 
 >ThresholdBetween_0);
   QWidget::setTabOrder(this->UI->ThresholdBetween_0, this->UI- 
 >ThresholdBetween_1);
   QWidget::setTabOrder(this->UI->ThresholdBetween_1, this->UI- 
 >AllScalars);

but it didn't seem to have any effect after a recompile.

Subject: [Paraview] custom filter?
In-Reply-To: <200809040918.17065.dominik@itis.ethz.ch>

Custom filter mechanism is designed to be used to combine a sub-pipeline 
into a single filter (or source) (with all the a paramter settings for 
each of the individual filters/sources) exposing a subset of the 
parameters to the user.

Eg. Here's my pipeline:
Sphere -> Shrink --> "Extract Edges"

Suppose we want to combine the Shrink-->ExtractEdges into a new custom 
filter "ShrunkEdges".

* Select the Shrink and the Extract Edges filter in the pipeline browser 
(use Ctrl key for multiple selections).
* With the two filters selected, go to Tools menu and choose "Create 
Custom Filter"
* The "Create Custom Filter" wizard will show up.
* First give our filter a new name. This name must be unique and if 
conflicting an error message will be shown. We are calling this one 
"ShrunkEdges" (step1.png). Then click "Next".
* We now choose what are the inputs to the custom filter that the user 
can set. By default, paraView will find the first filter in the 
sub-pipeline (in this case "Shrink") and expose it's "Input" property as 
the input to this custom filter. Since that's exactly what we want here 
(step2.png), click "Next".
* Next we need to choose the outputs from this filter. By default, 
paraview will choose the last filter in the subpipeline (in this case 
'ExtractEdges'. Let's say we want this custom filter to have two 
outputs, the output after the shrink stage as well as the one after 
extracting edges. ExtractEdges is already exposed as an output, we now 
expose the shrink filter as well. Select the "Shrink" in the left-side 
tree. It's output ports will be shown the "Output Port" combo. Choose 
the output port (relevant if the filter itself had more than 1 output 
ports), the assign it some unique name, say "ShrunkOutput" then press 
"+" to add it to the exposed outputs list (step3.png).  Click "Next".
* Next we expose the subset of parameters on this custom filter that the 
user can change at run-time. Let's say we want to allow the user to 
change the "Shrink Factor" on the shrink filter. Select the "Shrink" 
filter in the tree and then select the property to expose in the 
"Property" combo, assign it some name (or use the default) and the hit 
"+" to expose it (step4.png). Once all required properties are exposed, 
click "Finish" to create a definition for the custom filter.

The "Custom Filter Manager" will popup showing the newly defined custom 
filter. The manager is also available under the "Tools" menu. It can be 
used to remove/export/import custom filters.

Close this dialog.

Now to instantiate our new custom filter, simply look under the 
"Filters|Alphabetical" menu, we see our new "ShrunkEdges" filter. Now 
you can create it simply as if it were a normal filter.

Same is true with sources, if no input property is exposed, it's treated 
as a source and is available under "Sources" menu.

Thanks for the detailed explanation.

This does not seem ti work for transient datasets (it does the job for a given 
timestep only).
In addition, display properties can not be stored (opacity, active color 
scalars etc).
Or did I overlook something? Or do I need a more recent CVS? (mine is early 
August)

Thanks a lot,
Dominik

Subject: [Paraview] [XDMF] testing collections in parallel
Message-ID: <48C005CF.2090409@nacad.ufrj.br>


Jerry,

I've been doing some tests with XDMF and it seems that, now, the 
"spatial collection of temporal collections" (I will refer this 
combination as type 1 for simplicity) is working better than the 
"temporal collection of spatial collections" (type 2). I've implemented 
both and when I load in the type 1 the ParaView filters work just fine. 
I can use the calculator, isocontour, volume rendering, D3, etc... but, 
when I try the type 2, although the model is correctly loaded and 
rendered, some filters present a problematic behavior. D3 reports some 
kd-tree errors, the calculators does not compute anything, volume render 
closes the connection with the server. Maybe it's also related to the 
memory allocation and model extent problems reported by Jean sometime 
ago. Have you found anything? Can I do anything to help in finding the 
problem? I'm collecting some files for test and could send you later.

regards

Renato.

p.s.: I can't say nothing about parallel efficiency since the models I'm 
using are not so large and the time series are small as well.

This should be fixed in CVS now (at least for image data).

The requested piece was not passed down into request data this every
node was trying to produce everything. Also, the output image data was
not using dimension and extent to specify the global and local regions
properly.

cheers,
Dave

You may want to take a  look at lookmarks. Since you are interested in 
display properties, that might be better suited for your case. The 
paraview help has details about lookmarks.

Renato,

Answering from bottom to top .....

Jean's problem seems to be twofold. The first one was when running in 
parallel, internally XDMF was allocating memory for the entire dataset
way down in XdmfArray.cxx before re-sizing it to the proper size for the 
  piece. This has been fixed and checked in.

The second seems to be something to do with how the vtkXdmfReader is
keeping track of the vtkInformations from the vtk pipeline. This is
partially fixed. Dave Demarle just checked in a fix.

cvs up, and try again ... I'm going to try it here on some data.

Jerry

      return;
    }
}

and the other one does not???????????????????????????? (The other one - vtkHorizontalAverage - is posted in the post before)
Both should do the same thing, compute the horizontal average of the points of the grid, the only difference should be the data type of the input file! one is structured_points, the other one structured_grid!!!!!!

I?d be very grateful for any comments!
thx,

vtkStandardNewMacro() includes
vtkInstantiatorvtkHorizontalAverageNew(). You are missing that symbol
because you didn't use the macro.

If you have PV_PLUGIN_PATH defined on the server, ParaView should load
plugins from it. If this does not work, please report a bug in the

Santiago,
1) below may by covered by the "Refresh" button in the exodus reader.  Or, what data file are you interested in?

2a) is partially covered by bug number 6556.

2b) Great idea!

Takuya,

Can you try the attached patch and see if that fixes the issue?

Now the pqSMAdaptor tries to obtain the array status from the 
information property is not available in the property itself.

Can you let me know when you branch?  I'll get that snapshot into Fedora 
as a start then.

Well,
I added the vtkStandardNewMacro(vtkHorizontalAverage) -that?s the right parameter, isn?t it?
and now I get many compiler errors, like

'static *vtkHorizontalAverage vtkHorizontalAverage::New()' and 'vtkHorizontalAverage* vtkHorizontalAverage::New()' cannot be overloaded 

- is it now twice defined?

enother error: 

storage class specified for field "vtkInstantiatorvtkHorizontalAverageNew()"

and

vtkObjectFactory was not declared
CreateInstance() was not declared in this scope

what did I get wrong now?

thx,
NH

Subject: [Paraview] some suggestions
Message-ID: <200809051406506565745@gmail.com>



hi everyone, I am here want some suggestions.

We have successfully compiled Paraview3.2.2, both on Linux and Windows.

==============================================================

Recently, I was doing some work of custom it.

Firstly, we tried to gave a simplified Chinese version of Paraview for most Chinese people who want to use it. And this work went well,

but we met some small trouble.

Some GUI was shown dynamic ,just modify *.ui file was not enough.

And I have do some hard work to solve some labels.

There still some difficult ones.

For example, the Clip interface , the ?Clip Type? label, and "Inside Out " checkbox, seem difficult to find the origin place.

could some one gives some tips ?

====================================================================

I got the Paraview Use Guide. But I think that was not enghou to learn well of Paraview.

Some other materials to learn Paraview, to custom my paraview-like system ?

ok, waiting for answers.

Gang

====================================================================

I am here trying to study the code of the best visualization software .

Great, in that case, I shall commit the fix to CVS sometime today.

There is no such filter in ParaView 3.2, but in the current CVS and the
soon-to-be-released ParaView 3.4 there is a filter called Merge Blocks that
will merge all the blocks into a single unstructured grid.

Subject: [Paraview] Problems with Writer
Message-ID: <535972.4599.qm@web110101.mail.gq1.yahoo.com>

Hey all,

I've already sent an e-mail about this problem, but I'll detail it better.

I'm trying to extend Paraview so that it can write an unstructured mesh to a file in a specific format, which I call nds. The logic of writing into it is already programmed, and seems alright. 

Well, I am able to build the project of the plugin and generate the dll so that I can load it with Paraview. When I click to save a model, I see the option to choose my extension. BUT...when I click OK to perform the operation, I get a windows-like crash in paraview: "Paraview is not responding...". Windows Vista lets me debug the program (as I'm working with visual studio 2005), and when the IDE opens, it shows me the following message:

Unhandled Exception at 0x05572bcb (vtkServerManager.dll) in paraview.exe
0xC0000005: Access violation reading location 0x00000000

The problem is actually in the vtkSMStringVectorProperty class, in the method setElement, in the statement:

unsigned int numElems=this->GetNumberOfElements();

As I was able to get the writer of the "Examples" Folder to work, I suspect that the problem is really with my writer, specifically in my writers.xml file. Had the model of this file change ultimatelly ? I'm asking this 'cause I've already used this plugin in another version of Paraview.

I'm sending attached my writers.xml file.

Thanks in advance !

Rafael March.

Hi all,

First of all, thanks to VTK and Paraview developers for creating such a
wonderful product. We have been using VTK for our visualization application
with Qt as UI library for volume rendering, isosurfaces, medical imaging
etc.  This year
we wanted to port the application to a distributed architecture :
computation server / (rendering server+client)

So, instead for using the paraview GUI, we used only the paraview PV server
library.
But we found that Paraview's server library isn't very well documented and
pluging-in
our GUI wasn't as trivial as we thought [ Please point me to the
documentation
if we are wrong :)  ] .  We finally came up with  a solution in which we
added proxy
and other classes to assist integration of our application.

We are making this library opensource so that its helpful for other
developers working
with VTK. Please download at:

http://vizz.sourceforge.net/


Thanks

Note that ParaView does not really use the active scalars, so there is a
good chance that you will be unpleasantly surprised when you don't get the
array you expect.

ParaView uses a newer convention of vtkAlgorithm to specify input arrays:
the vtkAlgorithm::SelectInputScalars() method.  The SelectInputScalars
method has a 5 argument signature which I won't get into, but can be set
through the server manager with a StringVectorProperty that has an
ArrayListDomain assigned to it.  The XML for defining this property looks
something like this.

     <StringVectorProperty
        name="SelectInputScalars"
        command="SetInputArrayToProcess"
        number_of_elements="5"
        element_types="0 0 0 0 2"
        animateable="0"
        label="Contour By">
          <ArrayListDomain name="array_list" attribute_type="Scalars">
            <RequiredProperties>
               <Property name="Input" function="Input"/>
            </RequiredProperties>
          </ArrayListDomain>
          <Documentation>
            Doing something with this array...
          </Documentation>
     </StringVectorProperty>

See the ParaView guide for more information on these tags.

In the source you posted previously, you had the New method defined in the
header file.  The vtkStandardNewMacro also defines the New method.  The
linker is complaining that you have made two different implementations of
the New method.

In your header file, change the line

  static vtkHorizontalAverage *New(){return new vtkHorizontalAverage;}

To

  static vtkHorizontalAverage *New();

I suspect the problems you are having with transient data is the same bug
reported in issue #7586.

If I have an 8 exodus file dataset, how do I only read in one of these files?  Is the only way to copy this file to a temp directory?  Even if I try to open one file, they all are loaded in.

Thanks,

Alan

Try scrolling down to the bottom of the object inspector panel and modify
the filename pattern properties.  I usually find it easiest to just set the
start and end indices.

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview for FLUENT Postprocessing
Message-ID: <48C3921D.6030608@yahoo.de>

Hi,

I tried Paraview 3.3.1 for postprocessing of FLUENT runs and I am quite 
happy with the tool. Nevertheless, I have some questions an comments:

   * Import of *.cas works for smaller cases but only fluids and no
     face zones are imported. The names of the fluids get lost.
     Separation of the input into individual fluids can be done by
     "Extract Block" Filter
   * An alternative might be Ensight-Format. It contains all zones
     (fluids and surface). Once more "Extract Block" extracts a zone.
     It would be helpful if all blocks could be splitted into
     individual zones at once. It would be very nice if names from
     multipart data could be kept in PV. As soon as I try to import
     some data from Ensight except meshes Paraview crashes.
   * I am not sure how to save mutiparts best for later use. I tried
     multibody vtk but names got lost as well as individuell PV-Parts

Maybe someone out there finds me comments helpful or has some additional 
hints or answers to my open questions.

Subject: [Paraview] Animation. Second view of a field variable. How to
	format the file.
Message-ID: <48C4AA60.3020503@powertech.no>

Hi All,

The data (x_i(t),y_i(t),z_i(t)) is formatted as one pvd and many vts 
file. The animation runs fine in one 3D view.

In addition there is an associated time-varying function (t,K(t)) (e.g. 
the kinetic energy of the system). I would like to create a second view 
and herein animate K(t) along with the 3D view.

In what file format (example?) would the (t,K(t)) be cast in order to 
make the animations in two views be possible? (The ParaView Guide talks 
about `unaligned data items' in connection with `Time' in Chapter 10, 
section 10.3, but from that point on I find no more path).

Thanks,
ChG

Hi,
 
I installed Paraview 3.2.1 for both client and server. Can I still plugin some stuff to it?
* The example given is for Paraview 3.3, izit means Paraview with older edition cant plugin??
 
Thanks!

Since ParaView 3.0 there's no pvclient executable. You simply use the 
paraview executable to connect either to a remote server(to act like the 
old pvclient) or connect to a builtin server (similar to the old 
standalone paraview)

Thanks. How does the server connection work, does the client open an  
MPI intercomm to node 0 on the server or just a flat socket connection?

It opens a socket connection to the root node.

Hello Lee Shi Yun,

Any plugins that you make must be built from the source code.  Plugin source codes are upward compatible so you can build a plugin for 3.2.3 and it will recompile to work on 3.3.1 .  To build a plugin from source code requires that you have built ParaView from source code as well.

I hope this answers your questions,

--Sam

Subject: [Paraview] Writer example
Message-ID: <986030.99151.qm@web110109.mail.gq1.yahoo.com>

Dear friends,

I'm trying to create my own writer, and I'm having some problems. I wonder if anyone could send me a source code with an writer example, so that I can use it as a template.

I know that there is one called MyTiffWriter under Examples/Plugin/Writer, in the latest cvs version of Paraview. I've already compiled it, and it works fine. But, it has no code implementation, just overwrites the already existing vtkTiffWriter. So, it would be more useful to me an example with an explicit writer implementation.

Can anyone provide me this code ? 

Thanks in advance.

Rafael March.

Give this a try. It does load with the latest ParaView CVS. Could not  
actually figure out how to use it but the plugin did compile and load.

OS X 10.5.4, ParaView CVS, Xcode 3.1 tooling. CMake 2.6.1

Message-ID: <201391.87071.qm@web59514.mail.ac4.yahoo.com>

Hello again,

I've written a BASH script that translates the paths of any libraries that have been accessing from the ParaView executable to use @executable_path but unfortunately the GUI plugins don't work on the destination computer.  I am using the RPath feature of MaxOSX to generate the .Dylib files.  My goal is to make my plugins work on any Mac running the 3.3.1 version of ParaView downloaded from the ParaView website.

On the build computer I'm getting the error message "QObject::setParent: Cannot set parent, new parent is in a different thread".  The plugins still work on this computer but if I copy them to another machine that doesn't have the build environment, the readers won't work.  The source plugin works since it only has a server-manager plugin anyway.  I suspect the filter would work also for similar reasons.

My build machine is a MacPro with 2 quad-cord Xeon processors and 4 Gigs of RAM running MacOSX 10.5.4 .

Hi Val:

Can you say more about what you have in mind for your plugin?  If it's 
more related to AG than ParaView, we can discuss it off the mailing list.

Couple things come to mind that need to be checked.
    Where exactly in relation to the paraview.app bundle are you  
trying to load the plugins from?
    Also, what is the output of running "otool -L  [plugin]".

I have some ideas but let's see the answers to those first..

Would it work to strip all the @executable_path's out, and fix the id of it, 
so you get something like this:

libLabReaderGUIPlugin.dylib:
        libLabReaderGUIPlugin.dylib (compatibility version 0.0.0, current 
version 0.0.0)
        libpqComponents.dylib (compatibility version 0.0.0, current version 
0.0.0)
        libpqCore.dylib (compatibility version 0.0.0, current version 0.0.0)
        libQtChart.dylib (compatibility version 0.0.0, current version 0.0.0)
        libQtTesting.dylib (compatibility version 0.0.0, current version 
0.0.0)
        libpqWidgets.dylib (compatibility version 0.0.0, current version 
0.0.0)
        QtAssistant.framework/Versions/4/QtAssistant (compatibility version 
4.3.0, current version 4.3.5)
  .. and so on.

With just library names, doesn't the Mac loader use the ones that are already 
loaded?
An exception to removing absolute paths might be if the plugin depends on 
something that paraview doesn't depend on.

Why not an intercomm, isn't MPI (RMA in particular comes to mind) the  
best method to transfer large amounts of data between a client and  
the root node?

Hi,

unfortunatelly, I couldn't compile it. Got 17 "error LNK:unresolved external symbol" like errors. Have any idea what's wrong ? Do you have another example ?

Thanks !

Give this a try. It does load with the latest ParaView CVS. Could not  
actually figure out how to use it but the plugin did compile and load.

OS X 10.5.4, ParaView CVS, Xcode 3.1 tooling. CMake 2.6.1

Hello Rafael,

Did you build ParaView from the source to link against?  What version of CMake are you using?

You could save K(t) as field data. Then you can extract the zero'th
entry in the K array (which has just one element) and plot that over
time. A vts file with field data in it looks something like this...

<VTKFile type="StructuredGrid" [snip]
  <StructuredGrid WholeExtent=[snip]>
    <FieldData>
      <DataArray type="Float64" Name="MyField" NumberOfTuples="1" format="ascii"
 RangeMin="26.1" RangeMax="26.1">
        26.1
      </DataArray>
    </FieldData>
[snip]

Hi Sam,

yes, I built Paraview from source, and I'm using CMake 2.6. I am able to cmake the writer, but when I try to build it under VS2005, I get 17 errors; all LNK: unresolved externals.

Sam, have you another writer example, different from the Tiff one in the CVS version of Paraview ? 

Thank you guys.

Rafael March.

Um No. Don't do that. If you remove any type of path from the  
"install_name" then OS X will look in the current directory for  
libraries. It is my understanding that the ParaView devs plan to put  
the libraries in Paraview.app/Contents/lib or somewhere like that. I  
still can not get an "install" to work so I can not figure out where  
everything is being put. The "official" places to put all these  
dependent libraries on OS X are within the bundle at
paraview.app/Contents/Frameworks/Qt*.framework
paraview.app/Contents/lib/*.dylib
paraview.app/Contents/plugins

Samuel was partially correct in that he ran intall_name_tool to start  
resetting install_name ids from the libraries. One thing that stands  
out is the fact that the Qt frameworks do NOT have any type of  
isntall_path on them. This is the first problem I see.

Next, none of the vtk and paraview libraries have the correct  
install_path on them either. That path should be something like:
  @executable_path/../lib/*.dylib

The plugin should NOT have any path for itself. This is an error/bug  
in the ParaView build system. On OS X (at least) the add_library()  
call within one of the macros should be with "module" and NOT  
"shared". This is causing problems for OS X with linking. I thought I  
put in a bug report on this, maybe not. Either way it needs to be fixed.

This brings up the next issue. With all of these paths and such what  
is the best way to really do this. I am reading up on the "@rpath" and  
"@loader_path" instead of @executable_path.

Try putting the following at the top of the .h file:


#ifndef _MXA_DLL_EXPORT_H_
#define _MXA_DLL_EXPORT_H_

/* Cmake will define MXADataModel_EXPORTS on Windows when it
configures to build a shared library. If you are going to use

*/

#if defined (WIN32) && defined (BUILD_SHARED_LIBS)
#if defined (_MSC_VER)
#pragma warning(disable: 4251)
#endif
   #if defined(SMExampleTiffWriter_EXPORT)
     #define  VTK_IO_EXPORT __declspec(dllexport)

#else /* defined (_WIN32) && defined (MXA_BUILD_SHARED_LIBS)  */
  #define VTK_IO_EXPORT
#endif


#endif /* _MXA_DLL_EXPORT_H_ */

We can clean this up later..but see if that gets rid of the link errors.

Do you know what is missing ?

Thanks a lot for the attention !

This post pretty much explains everything. BUT the solution used is OS  
10.5 ONLY as it would seem so those with 10.4 may be stuck.

http://www.codeshorts.ca/2007/nov/01/leopard-linking-making-relocatable-libraries-movin

Just depends how far back in OS X the ParaView developers want to  
support. 10.4 support is pretty reasonable, at least if they are going  
to release by the end of the year.

Hi Raphael, it's Renato.

This linking errors seem that CMake is not finding your ParaView build 
dir, or you have a project mismatch. Note that if you're building a 
"Release" ParaView you must also build a "Release" plugin project.

Cheers

Renato.

Subject: [Paraview] problems with defining the New()-Method
Message-ID: <BAY122-W31F349F875EA6C6522FBB1BC540@phx.gbl>


Hi!
I?m trying to write a new filter, but I?m encountering major difficulties defining the New()-method of my class:
I?m deriving from "vtkDataSetToStructuredFilter.h" and my .h-file looks like this:

vtkHorizontalAverage.h:
#ifndef __vtkHorizontalAverage_h
#define __vtkHorizontalAverage_h

#include <vtkDataSetToStructuredGridFilter.h>
#include <vtkObjectFactory.h>
#include <vtkObject.h>

class VTK_EXPORT vtkHorizontalAverage : public vtkDataSetToStructuredGridFilter 
{ public:
  static vtkHorizontalAverage *New() {return new vtkHorizontalAverage;}
  //vtkStandardNewMacro(vtkHorizontalAverage);
  vtkTypeMacro(vtkHorizontalAverage,vtkDataSetToStructuredGridFilter);
  vtkSetMacro(Normalize,int);
  vtkGetMacro(Normalize,int);
  vtkBooleanMacro(Normalize, int);
  void PrintSelf(ostream&, vtkIndent);

  protected: vtkHorizontalAverage();
            ~vtkHorizontalAverage(){};
            
             int Normalize;
 
             void operator=(const vtkHorizontalAverage&) {};
             void Execute();
};
#endif

and the corresponding .cxx - File:
#include <vtkHorizontalAverage.h>
vtkHorizontalAverage::vtkHorizontalAverage()
{
    this -> Normalize = 0;
}

void vtkHorizontalAverage::PrintSelf(ostream& os, vtkIndent indent)
{
    this->Superclass::PrintSelf(os,indent);
    
    os << indent << "Normalize: " 
     << (this->Normalize ? this->Normalize : 0) << endl;
}

void vtkHorizontalAverage::Execute(){}


I?m still going to define the Execute() Method. it is just that I want to try out the linking!

Well, I get the following errors:

..\..\..\..\bin\libvtkPVFilters.a(vtkPVFiltersInstantiator.obj):vtkPVFiltersInstantiator.cxx(.text+0x2c0): undefined reference to 'vtkInstantiatorvtkHorizontalAverageNew()'
..\..\..\..\bin\libvtkPVFilters.a(vtkPVFiltersInstantiator.obj):vtkPVFiltersInstantiator.cxx(.text+0x3c0):
undefined reference to 'vtkInstantiatorvtkHorizontalAverageNew()'

I don?t understand, my New() IS defined as  {return new vtkHorizontalAverage;}!!!


Second try: If I really do not define the New() -method, i.e. instead of 
"static vtkHorizontalAverage *New() {return new vtkHorizontalAverage;}"
I just write 
"static vtkHorizontalAverage *New();"
I get the same errors as above, but not just two times, I get them four times. !?? 


Third try: using vtkMacros:
I used vtkStandardNewMacro, the code looks like this:

#ifndef
...
#include <vtkObjectFactory.h>
...
class VTK_EXPORT vtkHorizontalAverage : public vtkDataSetToStructuredGridFilter 

{ public:

  //static vtkHorizontalAverage *New() {return new vtkHorizontalAverage;}

  vtkStandardNewMacro(vtkHorizontalAverage);
..

and I get the following errors, now while building the vtkHorizontalAverage.obj file:
In file included from D:\ParaView3\Servers\Filters\vtkHorizontalAverage.cxx:1:
D:\ParaView3\Servers\Filters\vtkHorizontalAverage.h:11: error: storage class specified for field `vtkInstantiatorvtkHorizontalAverageNew?
D:\ParaView3\Servers\Filters\vtkHorizontalAverage.h:11: error: `vtkObject* vtkHorizontalAverage::vtkInstantiatorvtkHorizontalAverageNew()?
and `vtkObject* vtkHorizontalAverage::vtkInstantiatorvtkHorizontalAverageNew()?cannot be overloaded
D:\ParaView3\Servers\Filters\vtkHorizontalAverage.h: In member function `virtual vtkObjectBase* vtkHorizontalAverage::NewInstanceInternal() const`:
D:\ParaView3\Servers\Filters\vtkHorizontalAverage.h:12: error:error:passing ?const vtkHorizontalAverage?as `this?argument of `vtkHorizontalAverage* vtkHorizontalAverage::New() discards qualifiers



Does anyone have an idea what to do?
Thx very much, 
NH

Ok, I?m really, really sorry. 
Of course I have to put the vtkStandardNewMacro(vtkHorizontalAverage) in the .cxx-file and not in the .h-file, everything works fine now. 
Sometimes (at least I hope it is just sometimes!!) I am so stupid..

Subject: [Paraview] Internalisation of, 2D vs 3D
Message-ID: <48C649CE.308@scconsultants.com>

Hi,
does somebody have been heard about internationalisation in Paraview (or 
internationalised version) ?

Is it possible to load a 2D vtu rather a 3D in Paraview ?

thanks in advance for any advice .

Subject: [Paraview] how to simplely built my own code
Message-ID: <62f123080809090327x6f6a99day2cfd78969cae921a@mail.gmail.com>

   Hi , everyone, I have some simple questions.

   In order to custom some testing, I want to add my own code in the
paraview source code, and at the same time , I want to keep it portable.

  But problems comes, for example,  I want to include <QPoint>, <QTime> and
so on, the lib files of course.

  To me,  source code was built by cmake  and .Net2005, all was finished
automatically.

  So, here when I include those head files, it could not be compiled.

  Anyone who has the experience, or knows some solutions, please gave some
suggestions.

  Thanks very much.

  Gang

Subject: [Paraview] cast from vtkDataSet to subclasses
Message-ID: <BAY122-W32E9C49A124C17E2E6D810BC540@phx.gbl>


Hi!
Is there any possibility to cast from vtkDataSet to vtkRectilinearGrid or vtkStructuredGrid,....?
I?m writing a filter which should input vtkDataSet, it?s to say I have RectilinearGrid, StructuredGrid and StructuredPoint files with which the filter should work. 
I need to extract the dimensions from these DataSets, i.e use "GetDimensions(dims)" to implement my algorithm, so that?s why I?d need the downcast.. 
or is there any other possibility to get the dimensions of the input Dataset?

thx,
NH

try this:

#include "vtkStructuredGrid.h"
#include "vtkRectilinearGrid.h"

vtkDataSet* ds = ...

vtkStructuredGrid* sg = vtkStructuredGrid::SafeDownCast(ds);
if (sg)
   {

vtkRectilinearGrid* rg = vtkRectilinearGrid::SafeDownCast(ds);

etc.

Subject: [Paraview] Calculator speed
Message-ID: <b8f06b560809090558o2b2ce527v2d2238acb622d7bd@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I've written a CFD solver that uses Paraview in parallel mode with
hdf5/xdmf. Currently, the application writes out the primary variables
and lets the user calculate any desired secondary variables using the
calculator. However, this procedure is very slow -- it seems to be an
order of magnitude faster to calculate the data in the solver itself
and have Paraview read it from disk. I suspect this is because the
calculator expressions get translated to python code, but I might also
be doing something wrong.

Am I correct in thinking that the easiest way to fix this would be to
write a custom filter in C++?

Cheers,
Tobias

Not to my knowledge.  I don't think this has achieved a high enough priority
on anyone's list to implement yet.

Neither ParaView nor VTK treats 2D unstructured grids differently than 3D
unstructured grids.  I can only assume that you mean a vtu file containing
only 2D cells that lie on a plane.  Simply load it into ParaView as you
normally would.

Tobias,

I would agree that the parsing of calculator expressions is probably slowing
down the calculations.  I also agree that a custom filter would be the
easiest way to fix the problem (and would probably simplify things for
users).

The array calculator does not use Python but it is slow nevertheless.
Actually, this could be done much faster using Python/NumPy. This is
currently possible but hard to do (complicated API). We are working on
an easier-to-use interface.  If you are adventurous, I can give you
some pointers. Otherwise, C++ custom filter is the way to go.

Subject: [Paraview] Relocatable plugins on ParaView CVS for Mac?
In-Reply-To: <372681.81071.qm@web59510.mail.ac4.yahoo.com>

BTW, I am working through the OS X ParaView app bundle building script  
trying different ideas to see what might be able to work. Hard part  
for me is that I do not have access to a reasonably fast 10.4 machine.  
(1.25Ghz G4 Mini is just painful). I am building on OS X 10.5.4  
currently for my testing.

I have a batch of changes already that I will probably submit as a bug  
report. Mainly just organizing the paraview.app bundle a bit more to  
Apple's standards.

ok,
when I load a 2D vtu, Paraview complains about  "number of components is 
different" and crashes.
all my Z components can be set to 0, but I would like to avoid setting 
for instance a probe
line in a 3D env, where the only relevant plane is X*Y : in this last 
case the probe is not
aligned with the X*Y plane.


thanks anyway

All coordinates of all data sets are defined in 3D Cartesian coordinates.
That's just the way VTK was designed.  Allowing for variable length
coordinates would be a significant burden on many developers.

You will have to pad your coordinates with 0's in the Z components.

Message-ID: <C27736FF-2F59-43FD-B534-6F22D6F46456@cs.duke.edu>

Hello,

So far we have just used Xdmf/HDF5 and ParaView to view data from  
small runs on a single machine, where we generate a time series as the  
simulation progresses by appending snapshots of the data to the same  
HDF5 file. As we work towards larger simulations (on a cluster) which  
will run much longer, my collaborators are wondering whether we will  
be able to view any of the data before the whole run is over? This  
could be a snapshot of the current state, or the ability to animate  
the data up to the most recent time step, and it wouldn't have to be  
an auto-update, as in "Animating Live Data" (although they would like  
this ability, too :).

Do any of you have experience checking on your Xdmf/HFD5 data while  
it's being generated? And, if so, are there any special tricks to it?  
(I know I had trouble reading an HDF5 file one time that I hadn't  
closed properly, so I wouldn't be surprised if there are issues  
regarding whether the file is closed between writes, but I don't know  
if there are other issues, too.)

Thanks for the help,
-Eric

Subject: [Paraview] CTH Reader/Parts extract problem
Message-ID: <48C6A44C.4080905@arl.army.mil>

I have a CTH 8.1 dataset that I'm loading up using a development version 
of Paraview.     When I load up the data and use the "Extract CTH Parts" 
filter, everything seems to work fine with the exception of some 
unexpected holes in the resulting geometry.       Due to the shape of 
the holes, I'd say that it looks like Paraview is not collecting all of 
the extracted features from the servers.      I have a build from the 
CVS repository from April that works fine - but the builds I have from 
August CVS downloads have the missing geometry/holes.     

So, at this point, I don't know if it a problem with the CTH reader, the 
"Extract CTH Parts" filter, or some oddity of OpenMPI that I built against.

Just to verify that the data itself is OK, I've done a couple of tests:
- if I load up the data running only 1 pvserver, the geometry looks 
fine, although quite slow to load!  8-)
- if I create a slice through the original geometry on the at the same 
location as one of the holes, the resulting clip plane is correct.

Any recent changes to either the CTH reader or CTH part extract function 
that might explain this?

Is the current CVS version of ParaView broken with respect to  
launching QtAssisant? I am on OS X 10.5 (intel) and after a build when  
I try to use the "Help->Launch Assistant" menu I get an error that  
simply states "Failed to start Assistant".

I can't figure out if the paths are wrong or what?

Any help is appreciated.

Hi Rick,

Looks like it's in the reader, as rolling back all of the changes 
between now and then fixes. I'll see if I can isolate what went wrong. 
Now might be a good time to add a regression test as well.

Are you generating one big HDF5 file or one per time step or one per
time step per process?

Yup. We noticed the same problem. It is failing on our Mac dashboard.
We will track it down soon.

Found the problem. Currently in the pqClientDocFinder.txt file you  
list the entire path to the QtAssistant executable. Qt is trying to be  
_too_ cute and they actually add ".app/Contents/MacOS/assistant" in  
the QtAssistantClient.cpp constructor.

In the Applications/Client/CMakeLists.txt file around line 156 you can  
add the following:
IF (APPLE)
   SET (PV_ASSISTANT "${QT_BINARY_DIR}/bin/assistant")
ENDIF (APPLE)

which "works for me". I have a DyLib build of Qt instead of a  
Framework build but should work there also.

I am working on some other fixes for these issues in the mean time.

Right now we're generating one big HDF5 file, and then one to  
three .xmf files for the Xdmf grids (time series), which reference  
that HDF5 file.

Hi Rick,

Yes, cth-med, when I run client server, big box fragment is open on 2 
sides.

In case you want to temporarily roll back, the problem was introduced 
the commits to vtkSpyPlotReader.cxx & .h on 2008-06-11. The last working 
verision is: rev 1.61 for spyPlotReader.cxx and rev 1.21 for 
spyPlotReader.h. I am working on a fix.

Hi Rick,

I was able to track down the issue & I committed a fix. Dashboards have 
digest the changes and look OK. Please let me know if you continue to 
experience the difficulty.

Subject: [Paraview] slow rendering speed
Message-ID: <d0767b160809091524n278aea5co1921eb477477e3b9@mail.gmail.com>

Hi there. I use the client/server mode of paraview to render a small
data(about 4M), but the speed is very slow.
Below is how I do it:
I first ssh to the cluster and start the pvserver by this command: mpirun
-np 4 ./pvserver. The cluster is SGI Altix 4000. The operating system on the
cluster is SUSe linux, 64 bits system.
Then, I launch the paraview client on my local windows computer. After the
client connected to the server, there are two types of errors:
1. Xlib: extension "XFree86-DRI" missing on display "localhost:10.0"
2. unaligned access to 0x600000000197a1bc, ip=0x2000000003568e0
Paraview works regardless of these errors, but the problem is that the
rendering speed is way too slow.
I am wondering what could cause the slow down? Maybe the paraview doesn't
use GPU on the clusters at all? How could I tell if the paraveiw use GPU or
not?
Or the unaligned access slow down the speed? These errors keep on repeating
whenever I change the viewplane.
I have stalled by this problem for days, any idea would be highly
appreciated.

Thanks!

Message-ID: <62f123080809091807w1885cf43x185b0f23437febd5@mail.gmail.com>

     hi , everyone, I was a  little confused about some re-compile problems
on Paraview.

     I have added some include files into the original file pvserver.cxx for
some custom usage. (Using VS.Net2005)

     When compile it , it said that the include file could not be found. And
If I use the absolute directory, then the lib file would not be found.

     Of course that was not a good solutio. How to simplely compile it ?

    thanks.

All the best !

Hi,

the hdf5 that is in paraview segfaults the paraview build on sparc:

http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=494031

and we fixed that by using the Debian systemwide hdf5, that works. See
the bug report for all the technical details why and where it fails
and even for a patch to hdf5 in paraview that (also) fixes it.

The header files you are trying to include are apparently not in the include
path.  You can add paths for the compile to search for include files using
the INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES CMake command in the
ParaView3/Servers/Executables/CMakeLists.txt file.

Message-ID: <C4ED233D.F50%kmorel@sandia.gov>

First, let me just say that you should not expect the parallel rendering of
such a small data set to be faster than just rendering it locally.  The
parallel rendering has a constant overhead involving the readback of pixels,
the transfer of data, and the computation of compositing operations.

That said, based on the error it looks like your DISPLAY environment is set
wrong.  You should be connecting to localhost:0.0, not localhost:10.0.  You
are probably forwarding all of your rendering commands back to the desktop
you logged in from though ssh forwarding.  That, of course, will really slow
things down because all the rendering commands are being shoved through the
network and all are being processed on a single machine.

Make sure that you are actually rendering to the local GPU.  See the
ParaView Wiki for more advice.

Message-ID: <c9adba420809100630q407aee94y34f626366eb4c0ae@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have a filter that has some properties (StringVectorProperty) that I
want to exclude from the pvsm file.  Is there something that I can put
in the xml file for my filter to do this?  Ideally I would still like
it to work for "undo" but not stored in the state file.

Any help would be appreciated,
Paul

I've looked into this a bit more - the state file stores the return
values for the Get method on my properties.  I would like these to be
requested rather than cached in the file.  Is there a way to do this?
Or, can anyone suggest a workaround?

Thanks,

Hi Gang,

I noticed a previous post of yours on the mailing list where you said you
wanted to include headers like <QPoint> and <QTime>.  Are these the headers
you are trying to add to pvserver.cxx?

Normally, Qt headers like this are not added to files in
ParaView3/Servers/Executables.  The pvserver executable is not linked with
Qt libraries, only the client GUI executable is (files in ParaView3/Qt and
ParaView3/Applications/Client)

Thanks your help again, Ken.
You figure out my problem. I indeed connect to localhost:10.0. I am a newbie
of Linux and ssh, I don't know how to connect to localhost:0.0 instead of
10.0. After I ssh to the cluster, the DISPLAY automatically set to
localhost:10.0. I use "/usr/bin/env DISPLAY=localhost:0" command to set it
back. Then, when I try to connect to the paraview server, I get an error
like this "DISPLAY is not accessible on the server side".
I know that if I start pvserver from the cluster directly, the DISPLAY is
localhost:0, but the cluster doesn't have any keyboard and monitor.
How can I connect to localhost:0 remotely?
Thanks!

Aaron

Which version of hdf5 is Debian using? Maybe we should upgrade the one
in ParaView...

1.6.6-4

I don't know which version Paraview uses, but the problem is that even
the newest hdf5 from upstream one has the bug, see the bug report in
my original email for details.

To make it precise --- the version in Debian has the bug fixed
somehow, but if you just take the upstream hdf5 tarball and build it,
it segfaults, just like paraview currently.

Do you have a dataset that demonstrates the problem?

I am not sure I understand the question. You are asking what the best
format is to save out multi-block files?

It sounds like you are using the env program wrong.  The env program runs a
command, specified on its command line, with a modified environment, but
does not modify the environment of the calling program.  To use env, you
need to use it within your mpirun command:

mpirun -np 4 /usr/bin/env DISPLAY=localhost:0 ./pvserver

Hi!
Isn?t the vtk class "vtkScalars" used in Paraview? I didn?t find the .h or .cxx file for it. How can I add it, i.e. where do I place the source and which cMakeLists files do I have to alter to get it compiled with the rest?

thx,
Natalie

vtkScalars? Even VTK doesn't have such a class. Are you sure you have 
the correct name for the class you are looking for?

You probably have a code that depends on old VTK. Look at:

Hi Ken. Thanks for reply again.I have tried this command, but the error is
still the same: "DISPLAY is not accessible on the server side".
In the wiki, there are three things to do with X Connections:

   1. Have xdm run on each cluster node at startup. Although xdm is almost
   always run at startup on workstation installations, it is not as commonplace
   to be run on cluster nodes. Talk to your system administrators for help in
   setting this up.
   2. Disable all security on the X server. That is, allow any process to
   open a window on the x server without having to log in. Again, talk to your
   system administrators for help.
   3. Make sure each process is run with the DISPLAY environment variable
   set to localhost:0 (or just :0).

I have talked to system administrator about the first two things. The guy
said that both are ok on the cluster, but he isn't 100 percent sure about
the second thing. I try to run the glxgeasr program but it doesn't work. The
error I got is "couldn't open display '(null)' "
Could the problem result from the first two configurations? What do you
think?

Thanks,

Aaron

Hi Aaron,

Here are some things to try.  Ssh to the cluster and run glxgears.  You
should not see a glxgears window appear on your screen (if you do, it is
using X forwarding).  The command should appear to hang, and you will kill
it with control-c.  If glxgears fails, try different values of DISPLAY until
it works, for example:

export DISPLAY=:0.0

some shells set environment variables like this-

setenv DISPLAY :0.0


Once glxgears works on the main node, try it with mpirun.  Some versions of
mpirun have a command line option -x, this will export a local environment
variable to all the mpi processes:

mpirun -np 4 -x DISPLAY glxgears

or

mpirun -np 4 -x DISPLAY=:0.0 glxgears


If glxgears doesn't work for you, here is a simple debugging program I have
used in the past-

/* main.c */
#include <mpi.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main (int argc, char *argv[])
{
  int rank, size;
  MPI_Init (&argc, &argv);      /* starts MPI */
  MPI_Comm_rank (MPI_COMM_WORLD, &rank);        /* get current process id */
  MPI_Comm_size (MPI_COMM_WORLD, &size);        /* get number of processes
*/
  printf( "I am process %d of %d.  DISPLAY=%s\n", rank, size,
getenv("DISPLAY") );
  MPI_Finalize();
  return 0;
}

Compile it and run it:

$ mpicc -o main main.c
$ mpirun -np 4 ./main
I am process 0 of 4.  DISPLAY=:0.0
I am process 1 of 4.  DISPLAY=:0.0

Subject: [Paraview] questions concerning vtkFloatArray
Message-ID: <BAY122-W11AC9E9D79699E8D347746BC560@phx.gbl>


Hi!
In my new filter, I want to do some calculations with the Attribute Data, i.e Scalars, assign the new points to the output. The geometry is not alterated, although I implemented my new class as a subclass of 
vtkDataSetToStructuredGridFilter. The reason for this is, that I want to input StructuredPoints,StructuredGrid, and RectilinearGrid files. 

Well, that?s what it looks like now: (that?s an extract from the Execute() - method

vtkDataSet *input = this -> GetInput();
 vtkStructuredGrid *output = this ->GetOutput();

 int DataSetType;
 DataSetType = input -> GetDataObjectType();

 int dims[3],i,j,k;
 // pointer for casting
 vtkRectilinearGrid *rect_input = vtkRectilinearGrid::New();
 vtkStructuredGrid *structgrid_input = vtkStructuredGrid::New();


 vtkDataArray *scaldat = this -> vtkAlgorithm::GetInputArrayToProcess(0,input);
 vtkDataArray *new_scaldat;

 vtkFloatArray *scalars = vtkFloatArray::New();
 vtkFloatArray *new_scalars = vtkFloatArray::New();

 scalars = vtkFloatArray::SafeDownCast(scaldat); //this is now the input as vtkFloatArray
 int numbOfComp = scalars -> GetNumberOfComponents();
 if(numbOfComp !=1) vtkErrorMacro("Number of Components of Input Array bigger than 1!");
 int numOfTuples = scalars -> GetNumberOfTuples();

 vtkIDList ptId = vtkIDList::New();


 new_scalars -> SetNumberOfComponents(1);
 new_scalars -> SetNumberOfTuples(numOfTuples);


 if((DataSetType == VTK_RECTILINEAR_GRID) && (rect_input = vtkRectilinearGrid::SafeDownCast(input)))
  {
   rect_input -> GetDimensions(dims);
  } 

 

 else if((DataSetType == VTK_STRUCTURED_GRID )&& (structgrid_input = vtkStructuredGrid::SafeDownCast(input)))
 {
 structgrid_input->GetDimensions(dims);
 }

 else vtkErrorMacro("unsupported Dataset Format");

 //make the float arrays:

 float inPtr[dims[0]*dims[1]*dims[2] +1];
 float outPtr[dims[0]*dims[1]*dims[2] +1];




My first problem occurs in the part, where I already got the input Scalar array and casted it to vtkFloatArray. In order to perform arithmetic operations with the data in it, I want to assign each point of the vtkFloatArray to a "real" float array, but to do that, I need to get the vtkIDList of the vtkFloatArray , so I can use the GetPoint(vtkId x)-method. 

How do I get a vtkIDList of my vtkFloatArray?

secondly, 
i don?t really now how to set the output correctly. 
I want to use a method like CopyStructure() so that the grid is copied from input to output, but as the input is a DataSet and the output StructuredGrid, does this method compute points and so for the structuredGrid Format or do I have to assign them manually?

Thirdly, I don?t know how to assign my new vtkFloatArray as Attribute Data to the output. SetScalars() does not work here, the compiler says that this is not a member function of vtkStructuredGrid. But surely there must be a method to assign attribute data to a structured grid?

thx,
Natalie

This is going to create a memory leak. You New()'d a vtkFloatArray and 
never called Delete() before reassigning.

Also these are going to create leaks. You never call Delete() on the 
data sets you New()'d before reassigning.

There is no GetPoint() method for a vtkFloatArray. Do you mean GetTuple? 
The Tuples are ordered such the tuple 0 is associated with point/cell 0 
for point/cell data arrays. Are you looking to get the points associated 
with the data set or the scalar values associated with the points?

CopyStructure, does copy the geometry. Both the source and destination 
data set have to be the same type.

if you have point data then you can:

output->GetPointData()->AddArray(someArray);

There are similar calls for CellData and FieldData.

I would advise taking a close look at the examples in the vtk user 
guide. In the filters I have seen you will implement RequestData and get 
the input and output from an instance of vtkInformation. here is an 
example using unstructured grids:

int MyPv3Filter::RequestData(
        vtkInformation *req,
        vtkInformationVector **input,
        vtkInformationVector *output)
{
  vtkDataObject *tmpDataObj;
  // Get the inputs
  tmpDataObj
    = input[0]->GetInformationObject(0)->Get(vtkDataObject::DATA_OBJECT());
  vtkUnstructuredGrid *usgIn
    = dynamic_cast<vtkUnstructuredGrid *>(tmpDataObj);
  // Get the outputs
  tmpDataObj
    = output->GetInformationObject(0)->Get(vtkDataObject::DATA_OBJECT());
  vtkUnstructuredGrid *usgOut
    = dynamic_cast<vtkUnstructuredGrid *>(tmpDataObj);
 
  // do stuff here

  return 1;
}

In regard to the input arrays, they can be easily obtained from 
PointData, CellData, or FieldData via a call such as

usgIn->GetPointData()->GetArray(x).

It would be nice to have more format options for cube axes. For example size
of the font, position of label etc.

Many thanks,

Hello Ham Nath,

What I had to do was to make a custom source that would draw the text and 3 axes in 3d in order to get custom labeling for printing-related axes.  It would have been nice if the existing axes source supported this as well.

Hi Burlen,
thanks for your answer! 
I still have a few questions:

-) I don?t understand the structure of the vtkFloatArray (or in general, of the vtkDataArray): I have not points, but tuples? How is the data organised? Let?s assume, I have as an input a structured grid with 1000 points and scalar attribute data attached. In Vtk the points section would be described as a vtkDataArray with 1000 tuples and each tuple has 3 components. The scalar attribute data is another vtkDataArray with 1000 Tuples and each tuple has just 1 component. If it was vector attribute data, there would be again 3 components/ tuple. Did I get that right?
So, in my filter, I want to get the scalar attribute data and actually perform arithmetic operations with it, so I want to "get the values out" of the vtkDataArray, do some calculations, and assign the new array as scalar attribute data to the output. 

The grid itself, i.e the points would stay untouched, it is just that I have as input structured grid, rectilinear grid and structured points. In order to assign the geometry to the output, which has the format structured grid, is it ok to cast my rectilinear grid or my structured points to vtkStructuredGrid and use then the "CopyStructure"-Method? Or will this not work and I have to compute the points from the rectilinear grid and the structured points manually and insert it to the output structured grid?

-)to use the RequestData() method I have to specify the input in the server manager xml file, right?

thx a lot!
Natalie

(assuming you are using cvs paraview)
In the programmable filter, you can do something like:

from paraview import numpy_support

input = self.GetInputDataObject(0, 0)
ar = numpy_support.vtk_to_numpy(input.GetPointData().GetArray("pressure"))
ar2 = ar*2
newArray = nump7_support.numpy_to_vtk(ar2, True)
newArray.SetName("pressure times 2")
output = self.GetOutputDataObject(0)
output.GetPointData().AddArray(newArray)

In the future, this should look like:
output.point_data['pressure times 2'] = input.point_data['pressure'] * 2

Dig it.

Is numpy_support documented anywhere?

Subject: [Paraview] Adding Keyframes with no recognition of zooming
Message-ID: <47923.132.236.6.70.1221155845.squirrel@webmail.cornell.edu>

Hello,

I am currently running Paraview 3.2.1 on Redhat Linux version 5.2 and I
have run into a possible bug while I zoom in and out and add keyframes to
make a video.

Using the animation inspector with my selected object as the Camera,
whenever I zoom in or out and try to add a keyframe, the numbers
associated with the position of my current keyframe will not change.

For example, if I start up close to a set of data and continually move out
and add several keyframes along the way, the camera will stay at the last
position that I left it at and not start close and span back as the movie
progresses.

However, if I were to rotate the camera rather than strictly zoom in or
out, the keyframes that I save will work in a video if I were to play if
from the beginning. Zooming out while rotating will yield a result where
the keyframes only remember the rotating part of the camera's motion and
therefore the keyframes still do not register that the camera isn't at a
fixed distance from the origin.

I'm not sure if there is an option that controls what I have described
above or if this is genuinely a bug. Let me know what I can do about this
problem.

Thanks for the help,
Patrick Calhoun

You should obtain a current/recent copy of the vtk users guide. 
Basically the documentation of VTK is split in a number of places, as 
someone who is developing vtk codes, you need access to them all, since 
no there is no single source that has it all. In addition you will want 
the vtk text, and the paraview guide, and you will constantly be reading 
the online docs as well: 
http://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classes.html The online docs have 
examples linked in. Take a look at 
http://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkFloatArray.html for example. 
This is the nightly but you may want to look at the specific release you 
are using instead.

 Yep, pretty much. vtkPoints internally uses a vtkDataArray as you

check this out:
http://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkDataSet.html#a257bc67d26310ad0d6bef97c066c099

Nope. This has to do with the way the VTK pipelines are structured. The 
vtk users guide has an entire chapter devoted to writing filters. 
Alternatively, you can take a look at some simple filters. I beleive the 
vtkShrinkFilter is a very simple one that you can use as a model, until 
you get the books ;)

Subject: [Paraview] Adding Keyframes with no recognition of zooming
In-Reply-To: <47923.132.236.6.70.1221155845.squirrel@webmail.cornell.edu>
Message-ID: <C4EEC262.1020%kmorel@sandia.gov>

This looks like a bug.  The camera keyframes are not recording the zoom
level of a parallel projection.  I submitted a bug report:

  http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=7657

You can work around that problem by turning of parallel projection.

Subject: [Paraview] questions concerning vtkFloatArray
In-Reply-To: <48C92128.30006@kitware.com>
Message-ID: <C4EEC271.1020%kmorel@sandia.gov>

A couple of further comments.

The use of vtkDataSetToStructuredGridFilter is deprecated.  You really
should be subclassing vtkStructuredGridAlgorithm.  You override
FillInputPortInformation to report what types of input you want and override
RequestData to implement the action of the filter.  The code would look
something like this:


int vtkMyFilter::FillInputPortInformation(int vtkNotUsed(port),
                                          vtkInformation *info)
{
  info->Remove(vtkAlgorithm::INPUT_REQUIRED_DATA_TYPE());
  info->Append(vtkAlgorithm::INPUT_REQUIRED_DATA_TYPE(),
               "vtkStructuredPoints");
  info->Append(vtkAlgorithm::INPUT_REQUIRED_DATA_TYPE(),
               "vtkStructuredGrid");
  info->Append(vtkAlgorithm::INPUT_REQUIRED_DATA_TYPE(),
               "vtkRectilinearGrid");
  return 1;
}

int vtkMyFilter::RequestData(vtkInformation *vtkNotUsed(request),
                             vtkInformationVector **inputVector,
                             vtkInformationVector *outputVector)
{
  vtkDataSet *input = vtkDataSet::GetData(inputVector[0]);
  vtkStructuredGrid *output = vtkStructuredGrid::GetData(outputVector);

  ...


Also, you might want to consider using vtkSmartPointer when you create your
arrays and other VTK objects.  That way you don't have to think about
deleting them.

Help on module paraview.numpy_support in paraview:

NAME
    paraview.numpy_support

FILE
    /source/paraview/streaming-release/build/Utilities/VTKPythonWrapping/paraview/numpy_support.py

DESCRIPTION
    This module adds support to easily import and export NumPy
    (http://numpy.scipy.org) arrays into/out of VTK arrays.  The code is
    loosely based on TVTK (https://svn.enthought.com/enthought/wiki/TVTK).

    This code depends on an addition to the VTK data arrays made by Berk
    Geveci to make it support Python's buffer protocol (on Feb. 15, 2008).

    The main functionality of this module is provided by the two functions:
        numpy_to_vtk,
        vtk_to_numpy.


    Caveats:
    --------

     - Bit arrays in general do not have a numpy equivalent and are not
       supported.  Char arrays are also not easy to handle and might not
       work as you expect.  Patches welcome.

     - You need to make sure you hold a reference to a Numpy array you want
       to import into VTK.  If not you'll get a segfault (in the best case).
       The same holds in reverse when you convert a VTK array to a numpy
       array -- don't delete the VTK array.


    Created by Prabhu Ramachandran in Feb. 2008.

FUNCTIONS
    create_vtk_array(vtk_arr_type)
        Internal function used to create a VTK data array from another
        VTK array given the VTK array type.

    get_numpy_array_type(vtk_array_type)
        Returns a numpy array typecode given a VTK array type.

    get_vtk_array_type(numpy_array_type)
        Returns a VTK typecode given a numpy array.

    get_vtk_to_numpy_typemap()
        Returns the VTK array type to numpy array type mapping.

    numpy_to_vtk(num_array, deep=0)
        Converts a contiguous real numpy Array to a VTK array object.

        This function only works for real arrays that are contiguous.
        Complex arrays are NOT handled.  It also works for multi-component
        arrays.  However, only 1, and 2 dimensional arrays are supported.
        This function is very efficient, so large arrays should not be a
        problem.

        If the second argument is set to 1, the array is deep-copied from
        from numpy. This is not as efficient as the default behavior
        (shallow copy) and uses more memory but detaches the two arrays
        such that the numpy array can be released.

        WARNING: You must maintain a reference to the passed numpy array, if
        the numpy data is gc'd and VTK will point to garbage which will in
        the best case give you a segfault.

        Parameters
        ----------

        - num_array :  a contiguous 1D or 2D, real numpy array.

    vtk_to_numpy(vtk_array)
        Converts a VTK data array to a numpy array.

        Given a subclass of vtkDataArray, this function returns an
        appropriate numpy array containing the same data -- it actually
        points to the same data.

        WARNING: This does not work for bit arrays.

        Parameters
        ----------

        - vtk_array : `vtkDataArray`

          The VTK data array to be converted.

DATA
    VTK_ID_TYPE_SIZE = 8
    VTK_LONG_TYPE_SIZE = 8

Hi!
I have been looking and looking and overlooking but I cannot find it.. I need a method to assign a point data array, i.e scalar attribute data to a structured grid! How can I achieve that?

I need something like this:

struct_grid -> GetPointData() -> SetScalars(scalars) //scalars is a vtkDataArray *

thx, 
NH

Do you want to activate existing scalars or add a new one? What you show 
is the former, the latter would be searching for something like 
AddScalar in the docu.

Dear all,

 

A few questions:

 

1.	I can find the code for the Ensight writer, but I can't seem to
actually find how to write an ensight file from paraview. Am I missing
something?
2.	I am unable to install paraview cvs on Ubuntu Hardy Heron, I
receive a string of errors within ccmake, has anyone had success with
Ubuntu?
3.	I am trying to run paraview in parallel on openSUSE 10.3. this
is my output:

 

> mpirun -np 8 /usr/local/bin/pvserver

 

Libibverbs: Fatal: couldn't read uverbs ABI version.

I run ubuntu have no specific problems related to ubuntu. I will say 
that I have paraview soup to nuts installed from sources. That includes 
several flavors of MPI as well. I haven't tried running with mpi out of 
ubuntu package repos.

Hi Christer,

Hope you don't mind, I've posted back to the list. We at Kitware get
paid by the email response, and others on the list might benefit from
the discussion.

It's very easy to get the file format wrong when you do it by hand.
Plus I'm lazy so I let paraview to do it for me. I've attached an
example vts file with field data.

To create it I opened a SampleStructGrid.vtk from the VTKData
respository, extracted a smaller portion with ExtractVOI, wrote a
python filter script to add a field data array to it, then saved it in
vts format in ascii mode for readability.

Here is the script ( If you go this route make sure you copy the point
and cell centered data across too).
:
sgo = self.GetOutput()
fa = vtk.vtkDoubleArray()
fa.SetName("MyFieldData")
fa.SetNumberOfComponents(1)
fa.SetNumberOfTuples(1)
fa.SetValue(0, 23.1)
sgo.GetFieldData().AddArray(fa)

Here is the file:
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<VTKFile type="StructuredGrid" version="0.1" byte_order="LittleEndian"
compressor="vtkZLibDataCompressor">
 <StructuredGrid WholeExtent="0 2 0 3 0 4">

As talked about off list, does ParaView 3.4 now Require CMake 2.6.x 
(possible CMake cvs) and Qt 4.4.x?

Subject: [Paraview] will dual NVidia card in SLi mode help in rendering?
Message-ID: <189108.95700.qm@web35307.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Dear Paraview group:

Some of my trensient cases took a long time to render the pictures.? I have two NVidia 8600 GTS cards.? Will rendering time reduced if I install both cards on the same workstation and run in SLI mode?

Not yet. We haven't discussed when it will happen but I suspect it
will be soon. (At least CMake 2.6).

Subject: [Paraview] Getting values from a saved state with a script
Message-ID: <20080912.171147.74738503.walter@geodynamics.org>

Hello,

I have set up paraview so that it does some calculations and displays
the result in a spreadsheet.  I can save the state and then load it in
a script with LoadState().  I know how to save images of the 3D views
with GetRenderView().WriteImage.  But I have not figured out how to
get the data from the spreadsheet.  Ideally, I would be like to have
the script print out a number, although it would be fine to just save
an image of the spreadsheet.

I tried getting the list of proxies with 

  paraview.servermanager.pyProxyManager().GetProxiesOnOcnnection(paraview.servermanager.ActiveConnection)

I can get a SpreadSheetView object and SpreadSheetRepresentation
objects, but I do not know what to do with them.  I just can't manage
to get numbers out.  I am sure there is a way to do it, but I am a bit
stumped right now.

I have also tried using the dump script posted at 

  http://public.kitware.com/pipermail/paraview/2007-July/005427.html

but it did not work.

I am using version 3.2.1, although I also have 3.0.2 and 3.3.1 available.

Thanks,
Walter Landry

All,

as you can see paraview build failures stopped on sparc since we built it
using hdf5 libs installed on the system
http://buildd.debian.org/~jeroen/status/package.php?p=paraview

the other failures are due to openmpi not available on the platforms
paraview fails, we will have to disable mpi support on these platforms

Best regards
C.

Message-ID: <200809140923.30561.hobbsk@ohiou.edu>

( Berk, sorry for the dupe' 4096x2048 makes for a big PNG that was too big for 
the list )

I am continuing a thread from July since I have new information.

http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2008-July/008707.html

The original problem was that the mesa builds of VTK and ParaView on 
murron.hobbs-hancock can not save the output of render windows to files 
correctly. 

In messing around with one of my VTK programs that saves a render window to a 
PNG file I was able to create correct output.

When I tell the vtkWindowToImageFilter to SetInputBufferTypeToRGB the output 
is incorrect but whel i tell it to SetInputBufferTypeToRGBA the output is 
what I expect.

The source, RGB, and RGBA images are posted at:

Maybe.  If you are rendering polygonal data (i.e. not volumes) and have
immediate mode rendering turned off, then probably yes.  Otherwise, probably
not.

Message-ID: <134438.9986.qm@web110110.mail.gq1.yahoo.com>

Hey Paraview Community,
?
I have?a filter that receives an UnstructuredGrid as input, and associates an integer number (according to some rule, of course) to each Point of the mesh. So, I can use the Threshold filter to separate a piece of my model from the rest (for instance, I can filter my model in order to show only the nodes whose integer number is 6). The problem is, when I use this filter, Paraview atributtes new id's to the nodes. I would like to maintain the original numbers !
?
Does anybody know how to solve this problem ??I thought that I might store the point's memory address so that I can walk through the pipeline later and recover the id, but I don't think Paraview maintain these addresses either.
?
Thanks in advance.
?
Rafael March.

In your filter, you can add an array in which each point is given its
own unique index and mark it as the Active GlobalId array.
vtkDataSetAttributes::SetGlobalIds(the new array).

Paraview is careful about preserving this array and at extracting
cells/points based on it's contents. So at any point downstream (after
the threshold for example) you can look at its contents to figure out
exactly where each cell/point originally came from.

Recently I have been noticing an update issue with the 3D views.  For

Has anyone else been seeing this?

Subject: [Paraview] Getting original node's id's
Message-ID: <603982.97851.qm@web110106.mail.gq1.yahoo.com>

Hey Paraview Community,
?
I have?a filter that receives an UnstructuredGrid as input, and associates an integer number (according to some rule, of course) to each Point of the mesh. So, I can use the Threshold filter to separate a piece of my model from the rest (for instance, I can filter my model in order to show only the nodes whose integer number is 6). The problem is, when I use this filter, Paraview atributtes new id's to the nodes. I would like to maintain the original numbers !
?
Does anybody know how to solve this problem ??I thought that I might store the point's memory address so that I can walk through the pipeline later and recover the id, but I don't think Paraview maintain these addresses either.
?
Thanks in advance.
?
Rafael March.

- quick and dirty: keep original ids as a scalar point data
- elegant: use kd-tree search to find the original ids

Subject: [Paraview] displaying a set of colored points
Message-ID: <48CEAB45.4070402@nist.gov>

What is the simplest way to display a set of colored points. I tried to 
do it with vrml 2

#VRML V2.0 utf8

Shape    {
    geometry PointSet {
  coord Coordinate {point [
0.0 0.0 0.0
1.0 0.0 0.0
0.0 1.0 0.0
0.0 0.0 1.0
  ]}
  color Color {color [
  1.0 1.0 1.0
  1.0 0.0 0.0
  0.0 1.0 0.0
  0.0 0.0 1.0
  ]}}
}
 

It displayed the locations but not the colors

thanks
Judy

Nothing to really report at this time although I am looking into it.  
If you something sooner rather than later we may need to help you  
through some custom code. Note that the solution being worked on will  
_require_ cmake 2.6.2 at least.

Subject: [Paraview] Animation. Second view of a field variable. How to
 format the file.
In-Reply-To: <e85d6c9a0809081111l58cd3d1fy9c225cff116ffd5e@mail.gmail.com>

Message-ID: <48CF5CFD.3080004@powertech.no>

Hi Dave,

Thank you for your second response on the 12th of September in which you 
pointed out that it is very easy to get the file formats wrong. You also 
sent a full vts example which I copied to a vts file and let ParaView 
display in a 3D window. OK.

Therefore I followed your example and wrote my vts as follows: the 
fileddata (which represents an integrated variable of the system) is now 
put before the first <Piece Extent> in every one of the vts files. This 
takes me a step further, but there is still something that I have not 
got correctly because this is what happens in ParaView:

File/Open/pvd/Apply ---> OK. I see my geometry in the 3D view.
Split Vertical ---> Empty window opens
SpreadSheet View ---> OK
Click eye      ---> Some table opens in second window
Display FieldData ---> OK I see my FieldData in second window
animate ---> OK FieldData value changes

But it is an animated xyPlot that I wish, so I try the xyplot now in 
ParaView:

File/Open/pvd/Apply ---> 3D view opens correctly
Split Vertical ---> Empty window opens
xyPlot View ---> NO EYE

 From here I cannot proceed and I conclude I still do something wrong.  
Now, you also wrote "... make sure you copy the point and cell centred 
data across too". Is this where I fail?

Christer



My vts file(s) as they look now:

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<VTKFile type="StructuredGrid" version="0.1" byte_order="LittleEndian"
         compressor="vtkZLibDataCompressor">
 <StructuredGrid WholeExtent="0 1 0 40 0 91">

Subject: [Paraview] Excluding properties from state files
Message-ID: <c9adba420809160123p59a39b7fmd283d0160eff5f62@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Sorry to post this again - I still haven't found a solution.  Is there
a way to stop the state file (pvsm) from storing the property?  I.e.
is there an attribute I can add in the XML file?  I would like
ParaView to call the function to get the property instead.

Thanks in advance,
Paul

Subject: [Paraview] EnSight writer
Message-ID: <C9C5F90AF4778B449CF1FC5A9BD9148905F0BA@sbsserver.DigitalFlowSolutions.local>

Dear people,

  Sorry to go on about this. I can find the code for the EnSight writer,
but I can't seem to actually find how to write an ensight file from
paraview. 

I assume that it has not been implemented yet.

I have figured out how to add file readers and filters by editing
filters.xml, ParaViewFilters.xml etc.

If you look in the writers.xml and ParaviewWriters.xml I can see the
code for the EnsightWriter there, yet there is no option for it at
runtime.

It seems to me that the writers are set up very differently from the
readers and the filters.

Could anyone advise me how to go about implementing the Ensight Writer,
or any writer in general?

 

Thanks,

Set  'is_internal="1"' and that property won't be saved in the state 
file. It also means that it's default value won't be pushed on to the 
underlying VTK object when the proxy is created. If you change the 
value, however, then it will be pushed as usual.

Thanks Utkarsh - that's the property I needed.

I figured it out.  I can just connect them to a DataSetWriter using a
script like

  pm=ProxyManager()
  energy=pm.GetProxiesOnConnection(ActiveConnection)["sources"]["IntegrateAttributes3"]
  work=pm.GetProxiesOnConnection(ActiveConnection)["sources"]["IntegrateAttributes2"]
  energy_writer=writers.DataSetWriter(Input=energy,FileType=1,FileName="energy.vtk")
  work_writer=writers.DataSetWriter(Input=work,FileType=1,FileName="work.vtk")
  energy_writer.UpdatePipeline()
  work_writer.UpdatePipeline()

That writes the data to a file.

Hi!
I?m still encountering problems with my filter, it does compile and link neatly with paraview, but at runtime  an error occurs which causes paraview to shut down. I?m pretty sure that the problem is how I define the output, that this is not done correctly. Lastly, I commented just the algorithm out to test the in- and output, and it looks like this:

void vtkHorizontalAverage::Execute()
{vtkDataSet *input = this -> GetInput();
 vtkStructuredGrid *output = this -> GetOutput();

 int DataSetType;
 DataSetType = input -> GetDataObjectType();

 if(DataSetType != VTK_RECTILINEAR_GRID) { vtkErrorMacro("unsupported DataSet format");}
 
 
 
 int dims[3],i,j,k;
 // pointer for casting
 vtkSmartPointer<vtkRectilinearGrid> rect_input = vtkSmartPointer<vtkRectilinearGrid>::New();
 //vtkStructuredGrid *structgrid_input = vtkStructuredGrid::New();


 vtkPointData *scaldat = input -> GetPointData();
 vtkDataArray *new_scaldat;

 vtkSmartPointer<vtkFloatArray> scalars = vtkSmartPointer<vtkFloatArray>::New();
 vtkSmartPointer<vtkFloatArray> new_scalars = vtkSmartPointer<vtkFloatArray>::New();

 scalars = vtkFloatArray::SafeDownCast(scaldat); //this is now the input as vtkFloatArray
 scaldat -> Delete();
 int numbOfComp = scalars -> GetNumberOfComponents();
 if(numbOfComp ==1) vtkErrorMacro("Number of Components of Input Array bigger than 1!"); //!!!!
 int numOfTuples = scalars -> GetNumberOfTuples();


 new_scalars -> SetNumberOfComponents(1);
 new_scalars -> SetNumberOfTuples(numOfTuples);


 rect_input = vtkRectilinearGrid::SafeDownCast(input);

 if(!rect_input) {vtkErrorMacro("SafeDownCast to Rectilinear Grid failed");}

else {  rect_input -> GetDimensions(dims);
   
   //get the points:
   /*vtkDataArray *XCoord = vtkDataArray::New();
   vtkDataArray *YCoord = vtkDataArray::New();
   vtkDataArray *ZCoord = vtkDataArray::New();*/

   vtkDataArray *XCoord = rect_input -> GetXCoordinates();
   vtkDataArray *YCoord = rect_input -> GetYCoordinates();
   vtkDataArray *ZCoord = rect_input -> GetZCoordinates();
 
output -> SetDimensions(dims);
    vtkSmartPointer<vtkPoints> pts = vtkSmartPointer<vtkPoints>::New();
    pts -> SetNumberOfPoints(numOfTuples);


    for(int i=0;i<=dims[2];i++)
    { for(int j=0;j<=dims[1];j++)
        {for(int k=0;k<=dims[0];k++)
            {pts -> InsertNextPoint(XCoord -> GetTuple1(k),YCoord -> GetTuple1(j), ZCoord -> GetTuple1(i));
            }//for (int k
        }//for(int j
    }//for (int i
    
    XCoord -> Delete();
    YCoord -> Delete();
    ZCoord -> Delete();

    output -> SetPoints(pts); //Now the points are set
    //output -> GetPointData()-> CopyAllocate(new_scalars,0,new_scalars -> GetNumberOfTuples());
    output -> GetPointData() -> PassData(input -> GetPointData());
    new_scalars -> Delete();


Here I get as an input a data set, cast it down to rectilinear grid and compute the points for the structured grid. As I said, Paraview shuts down (Access violation my debugger says) when I execute it. 

Any help would be appreciated!
thx,
NH

It might help if you ran your code in a debugger and found out exactly where
the error occurred.

I think the for loops are wrong.  The conditions should be <, not <=.  You
might be mixing up dimension lengths and extent values.

I'm trying to develop a time-varying Source for a researcher based on some
of his code, and hoped to use the "Time Source" as an example, but I don't
see it actually doing anything over time.  How is this source supposed to
work?

It first tells the pipeline what times it can produce data for in its
RequestInformation method. Later on, in its RequestData method, it
figures out what time is requested, and then populates its
vtkImageData outputs. So depending on what time is asked for, it will
produce an output with varying number of cells, origin, and or
attributes.

Insert a time source, turn on moving, and animate and you should see
it bouncing around.

Dave

I see no option for "Moving", only
 Analytic (checkbox)
 X Amplitude (edit field)
 Y Amplitude (edit field)
 Growing (checkbox)

None of these seem to do anything as far as I can tell.  It won't let me
choose timesteps other than 1, and the Animation bar seems to do nothing but
turn it on and off.

Using PV3.2.3 compiled from the source published on the website.

It might have been because in 3.2 its proxy configuration entry in
sources.xml was missing. This entry is required in more recent
paraview.

      <DoubleVectorProperty
          name="TimestepValues"
          repeatable="1"
          information_only="1">
        <TimeStepsInformationHelper/>
      </DoubleVectorProperty>

Nevertheless (adjusting for the fact that I meant "Growing" or set
"X-Amplitude = 1" when I said "Moving") it still works on my copy of
3.2.

cheers,
Dave

Subject: [Paraview] How to test if Python is working
Message-ID: <1BD7BDC8-4BE0-418A-96DE-7EC4E161B84B@bluequartz.net>

I am hacking on ParaView and I am at the point where I need to give  
the Python functionality a go. Is there some simple python command I  
can type into the Python shell that would tell me if Python is finding  
the paraview python stuff?

I am a complete newbie to Python. I get at least the Python shell come  
up so I am at least that far.

Thanks

Subject: [Paraview] filter as plugin
Message-ID: <BAY122-W40943EC3F4A3BF9A0B00B5BC4C0@phx.gbl>


Hi!
I want to add my new filter as a plugin to paraview so I can debug it and do not need to build paraview new when I change something in the source.
I did the following:

I placed my source code vktHorizontalAverage.h, vtkHorizontalAverage.cxx in the directory
C:\ParaviewSource\ParaView3\Plugins

I added a HorizontalAverageServerManagerXML.xml file which looks like this:
<ServerManagerConfiguration>
 <ProxyGroup name="filters">
       <SourceProxy name="HorizontalAverage" class="vtkHorizontalAverage" label="Horizontal Average">
    <Documentation>
    This filter subtracts the horizontal average of the values on each point of the grid so that disturbances are seen more easily.
    </Documentation>
    <InputProperty name="Input"
           command="SetInputConnection">
       <ProxyGroupDomain name="groups">
         <Group name="sources"/>
         <Group name="filters"/>
       </ProxyGroupDomain>
       <DataTypeDomain name="input_type">
         <DataType value="vtkDataSet"/>
       </DataTypeDomain>
    </InputProperty>      
    </SourceProxy>
 </ProxyGroup>
</ServerManagerConfiguration>

and I added to the CMakeLists.txt - file the following lines:
INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES(
  ${VTK_INCLUDE_DIR}
  ${PARAVIEW_INCLUDE_DIRS}
)
    
ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN(HorizontalAverage "1.0"
  SERVER_MANAGER_XML HorizontalAverageServerManagerXML.xml 
  SERVER_MANAGER_SOURCES vtkHorizontalAverage.cxx)

Well, everything compiled neatly and linked, but when I start Paraview, in the menu Filters/Alphabetical there is no button for my filter as there should be..

Do you know what I got wrong?

thx,
NH

Did you use the "Tools" menu to load your plugin using the "Manage  
Plugins" menu item?

Dependent on the platform, the plugins must be copied to a specific directory. 
Or you can define a custom one via an env variable (PV_INTERFACE_PATH or 
something like this)

Hi Mike,

After you open the python shell, try these commands:

help(servermanager)
help(servermanager.ProxyManager)

To test a specific proxy, try something like:

proxy = servermanager.ProxyManager().NewProxy("sources",
"SphereSource") #groupname, proxyname
dir(proxy)
print proxy

If you decide you want to get down and dirty, all the magic happens in
ParaView3/Utilities/VTKPythonWrapping/paraview/servermanager.py

Thanks Mike,

I've got CMake 2.6.2-RC4 installed at the moment and my boss is making sure that everything ParaView related will compile on his machine as well.  We should be done installing and trying out the plugins sometime this afternoon so we can start making them relocatable soon.

There is some information about time support on the Wiki
http://paraview.org/Wiki/VTK/Time_Support
and the  April issue of Kitware Source
http://kitware.com/products/apr2007.html

In addition to what is described there, you need to have the following
in the reader XML:

     <DoubleVectorProperty
        name="TimestepValues"
        repeatable="1"
        information_only="1">
        <TimeStepsInformationHelper/>
        <Documentation>
          Available timestep values.
        </Documentation>
     </DoubleVectorProperty>

If you feel like condensing all of this information into one wiki
page, you could add it to the ParaView wiki. We have been working on
cleaning up the ParaView wiki. It is coming together nicely.

The EnSight writer that is in VTK only works for unstructured grids. I
have some code I hacked together long time ago to write other data
types. I can share if you are interested.

Hi Walter,

Sorry for the late reply. I have been swamped with writing
documentation. An easier way of doing what you want is to use the
Fetch method on the servermanager module. Look here for more
information : http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Python_Scripting#Source_Proxies
(the second example there).

In your case, it would look like:

data = servermanager.Fetch(pm.GetProxiesOnConnection(ActiveConnection)["sources"]["IntegrateAttributes3"])

where data is a VTK data object (probably a polydata).

There seems to be a bug in the VRML importer. The colors are not
coming in properly. If they did, all you had to do is to uncheck the
Map Scalars option on the display page for ParaView to display the RGB
colors.

The easiest thing to do is probably write a legacy VTK file that
contains a polydata with vertices. It would look like the following.
Make sure to uncheck Map Scalars after loading this.

# vtk DataFile Version 3.0

Hi!
I?ve successfully loaded my plugin into paraview and it works fine, but when I try to debug the plugin, i.e. I start paraview in gdb and try to load the plugin, it does not work - what can I do? I need to debug this plugin, it still does not work correctly (i.e everytime I apply the plugin paraview shuts down), what can I do?

thx,
NH

Well, I start Paraview in gdb, go to the "tool" button in the paraview menu, I go to "Manage Plugins" and then I select the corresponding .dll for my plugin. I click ok, and then paraview stops. 
gdb says 
"Program received signal SIGTRAP, Trace/breakpoint trap.
0x7c911231 in ntdll!DbgViConnectToDbg()"

Is there any option in gdb to set that this does not happen?

Did you just try 'c' from gdb? Gdb will catch signals that are not
fatal and can safely continue most of the time. I believe there is a
way to tell gdb to ignore some signals as well.

Where should that "c" be typed in? 
I (started my cygwin) and typed "gdb paraview"
then it wrote a few lines about gdb and then I typed 
"run" . :-)
where should I type "c"?

Subject: [Paraview] Filter with Personalized "Properties" tab
Message-ID: <266925.44700.qm@web110108.mail.gq1.yahoo.com>

Hey all,

I have my own filter running well in Paraview. I would like to extend it to enable adding? scalar or vector properties, as well as changing existing data of nodes and cells. I would like to implement this feature through a customized GUI, like buttons, combo boxes and so on in the properties tab of the filter. 

How can I access and modify this tab ? Should I do it inside my filters code ? 

Any suggestions ?

Thanks all,
Rafael March.

I am seeing this only on my desktop Mac. Not on my MacBook Pro or Mac
Mini. I looked into it a bit and verified that VTK is rendering. I
assumed that it was some cosmic thing that was happening only on my
desktop. I just hacked VTK to disable double buffering and it seems to
fix the problem. Somehow we are not swapping buffers? Issues with
swapping buffer at Carbon level? I noticed that render is sometimes
finished if I go to another application before I even switch back to
ParaView....

You may want to read a tutorial on using gdb. 'c' is a gdb command
that stands for continue.

Subject: [Paraview] Filter with Personalized "Properties" tab
In-Reply-To: <266925.44700.qm@web110108.mail.gq1.yahoo.com>

You can customize the GUI somewhat by modifying the server manager XML that
describes your filter.  For example, you can create a combo box in the GUI
by adding an EnumerationDomain to an IntVectorProperty or you could create a
checkbox by adding a BooleanDomain.

You can also create your own properties panel using Qt code.  The wiki page
on ParaView plugins has a simple example of customizing the auto-generated
panel.  You can provide even more customization (for example, by using your
own panel created in Qt Designer) by subclassing either pqNamedObjectPanel
or pqObjectPanel.

I also noticed this on my MacBook Pro. So maybe it is video card  
related?

My MacBook Pro has an nVidia card.

Ken and Berk. What video hardware are you running that does and does  
not work?

Well, the mac mini we know is intel integrated graphics.

Message-ID: <414239.17302.qm@web59512.mail.ac4.yahoo.com>

Greetings,

In our quest to find out why my plugins don't work on other people's ParaView installs on the Mac version, my boss and I have identified a problem with the Qt frameworks in the ParaView package.  They don't list an @executable_path/../Frameworks/ in front of them or even an absolute path to the Frameworks directory.  This means that when I'm trying to relocate the plugins they find invalid symbolic links from the Qt Frameworks that are clearly visible as not having a path in otool -L .

Is this a known bug or should somebody file a bug report?  Is there a quick fix that I can use in the meantime?  I'll need to know soon because my contract is about to expire and I must get this done before that happens.

There was some work going on in the CMake CVS (not committed yet) but  
I don't think that it would help you. For some reason your Qt  
Libraries don't even have an install_name equal to their installed  
path. Can you rebuild the Qt libraries and try again?

Subject: [Paraview] question about points size
Message-ID: <200809191101.07094.dominik@itis.ethz.ch>

I wonder how PointSize is implemented in representation->points in ParaView.

Is it achieved with vtkGlyphSource2D/Vertex and setting the glyph size?

It works neatly in PV but I must achieve a similar effect using VTK and 
despite setting glyph size I always get a tiny pixel.

When I use vtkGlyphSource2D/Square it works, but then the square glyphs are 
not always aligned with the viewing plane.

Any hints are very appreciated.

Subject: [Paraview] problem configuring the output of a filter
Message-ID: <BAY122-W37574337944BDEEA693272BC4E0@phx.gbl>


Hi!
I have problems configuring the output of my filter, the filter is a subclass of vtkDataSetToStructuredGrid and setting the output looks as following:

//setting the new point data
vtkSmartPointer<vtkFloatArray> new_scalars = vtkSmartPointer<vtkFloatArray>::New();

double inPtr[numOfTuples + 1]; //pointer for casting the values actually to double, so I can perform arithmetic operations with them
 float outPtr[numOfTuples + 1];
//calculating ..

new_scalars -> SetArray(outPtr,numOfTuples,1);



output -> SetDimensions(dims);
    output -> SetPoints(pts); //Now the points are set
    output -> GetPointData() -> SetScalars(new_scalars);
    output -> Squeeze();


dims are the dimensions of the input, which is a RectilinearGrid or a StructuredGrid, new_scalars is a vtkFloatArray. I believe that the "output->GetPointData() ->SetScalars(new_scalars)"-line is causing the problem, because I get the following error messages:

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
vtkFieldData::GetActualMemorySize 
at C:/ParaviewSource/ParaView3/VTK/Filtering/vtkFieldData.cxx:577
size +=this->Data[i]->GetActualMemorySize();

Backtracing, functions in vtkPVDataInformation and vtkSelfConnections are called, 
so I guess, this does not actually happen in my source code but in the rendering pipeline. As I did not change anything in the rendering pipeline, there must be an allocation or a call in my code with incorrect arguments, but I do not really know where to look for the error. 
Does anyone have an idea?

Thx,
NH

You are passing a stack based array here, when your function returns 
inPtr and outPtr no longer are valid. If you are going to use SetArray 
you'll have to malloc or new the memory you need.

OK, as far as I understand the problem is that my inPtr and outPtr -arrays are on the stack and I nead it on the heap.
ahm.. how do I malloc or new the memory in this case? I thought that my call to SetArray does automatically allocate the necessary memory for my new_scalars array..
thx,
NH

Yes, I will try to make a 64 bit Windows binary for next release. Can
you be more specific about the allocation errors. What kind of grid?
What kind of filters are you using? Any other relevant information...
I am trying to figure out whether you are running out of memory
because of fragmentation issues or something else.

By using SetArray you are telling VTK to not allocate any memory, and 
instead use the memory you provide. You could allocate the memory with a 
call to something like
double *pd=static_cast<double *>(malloc(nTups*nComps*sizeof(double))); 
In your call to set array consider passing save as 0 so that VTK will 
free the array when its done with it.

Subject: [Paraview] precompile version and source tree
Message-ID: <d0767b160809191026n5e7ced7exe975bcce66dff291@mail.gmail.com>

Hi guys.
I can set up a Paraview server successfully right now, and it works
fine if I use the precompiled version of Paraview. However, if I build
the paraview from sources, the rendering speed of that version is at
least ten times slower than the precompiled version. I use the default
options to compile Paraview (except the installation path) and there
isn't any error in the installation. I am wondering if there are some
options which I should change manually to get a faster rendering
speed?
Also, which mpi implementation is recommended for paraview? I have
tried the mpi version of pvserver, but the rendering result on the
client is not correct. It's just some random dots.
Thanks,

Aaron

Why don't you just use vtkDoubleArray instead of double outPtr[..] ?


vtkFloatArray* new_scalars = vtkFloatArray::New();

// Assuming in is a temporary variable not needed after this so we use  
a smart pointer
vtkSmartPointer<vtkDoubleArray> in =  
vtkSmartPointer<vtkDoubleArray>::New();

float* outPtr = new_scalars->WritePointer(0, numOfTuples + 1);
double* inPtr = in->WritePointer(0, numOfTuples + 1);

// The next line is NOT needed because you are operating
// directly on the allocated array.
//new_scalars -> SetArray(outPtr,numOfTuples,1);

output -> SetDimensions(dims);
     output -> SetPoints(pts); //Now the points are set
     output -> GetPointData() -> SetScalars(new_scalars);
     output -> Squeeze();

// Keep the reference count correct.
new_scalars->Delete();

Ok,

thanks a lot, Kenneth ! One problem at a time ! :)

I've managed to add some QT Widgets in the properties tab by extending the pqAutoGeneratedObjectPanel. Now, how can I handle events generated by the GUI, in order to change properties of the model displayed in the screen ? I mean, how can I really connect my filter with the ObjectPanel ?

Thanks again !
Rafael March.

You can customize the GUI somewhat by modifying the server manager XML that
describes your filter.  For example, you can create a combo box in the GUI
by adding an EnumerationDomain to an IntVectorProperty or you could create a
checkbox by adding a BooleanDomain.

You can also create your own properties panel using Qt code.  The wiki page
on ParaView plugins has a simple example of customizing the auto-generated
panel.  You can provide even more customization (for example, by using your
own panel created in Qt Designer) by subclassing either pqNamedObjectPanel
or pqObjectPanel.

Hello Rafael March,

If you have the ParaView Guide version 3 I've found chapter 18 on Server Manager XML to be a good reference to all of the different tags that are supported.  I haven't even had to write a custom GUI panel since the default gadgets work well enough for most instances.

What kinds of gadgets are you using in your panel?

It lets GL so it. Ie it sends exactly the same polygons as for
wireframe or surface mode, but calls glBegin(GL_POINTS) and
glSetFloatV(GL_POINT_SIZE) before doing so in this mode.

Hi,

I think I've got the problem nearly solved.  I just had to set CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS to -headerpad_max_install_name in order to allocate more space for the names in the plugin's .dylib files.  Then I was able to prepend @executable_path/../Framework/ to the beginning of the Qt framework files with my Bash script.

I'll give it one last test and then I'll post my results.

Hello again,

I've attached a .zip file containing my fixer.sh BASH script and an example CMakeLists.txt file that uses it.  It requires that CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS be set to -headerpad_max_install_name so that there will be enough space for the new longer file paths.  Feel free to use them in any external plugins you wish.  The install path is assumed to be in paraview.app/Contents/MacOS/plugins/ so it will automatically load at startup.  Once installed, the ParaView bundle can be dragged to wherever you need it installed.

Thanks to everybody who helped my with this project and especially Mike Jackson who knew all the Mac specifics of ParaView that I needed to know.

Good bye everyone,

--Sam Crow

Doesn't CMake _always_ pass -headerpad_max_install_name ?  If not,
shouldn't it?  I see little downside to doing so, it's only a few bytes.

Yes. CMake always passes that flag.

Great that we will get a 64 bits Windows version for the next release.
My grid is unstructured and has approximately 17 million cells. It is
written as an ASCII .vtk file. The file is 2.6 GB. The exact error
message is:

""
ERROR: In c:\berk\releasebuilds\paraview3\vtk\common\vtkDataArrayTemplate.txx, line 312
vtkIdTypeArray (06F4DE28): Unable to allocate 137314503 elements of size 4 bytes
""

I had then run Paraview 3.2.1 on an HP machine with two quad-core Xeon
processors, 16 GB RAM and 64 bits Windows.

If do the same with ParaView 3.3.1 on my 32 bits PC with 2GB RAM I get
the same error message, but additionally the following:

""
Qt has caught an exception thrown from an event handler. Throwing
exceptions from an event handler is not supported in Qt. You must
reimplement QApplication::notify() and catch all exceptions there.
""

Yes, I will try to make a 64 bit Windows binary for next release. Can
you be more specific about the allocation errors. What kind of grid?
What kind of filters are you using? Any other relevant information...
I am trying to figure out whether you are running out of memory
because of fragmentation issues or something else.

Hmmm. I do find a call to glPointSize in ParaView source, but calling it in my 
custom code:

	glyph->SetGlyphTypeToVertex();
	glyph->SetScale(5);
	glyph->SetScale2(5);
	glPointSize(5.0);

still displays the vertex glyphs as 1-point pixels. So there must be more 
magic PV is doing... Also, when doing:

	gridActor->GetProperty()->SetRepresentationToPoints();

I also get single pixels, despite glPointSize(). And PV does react very nicely 
to the point size setting in the GUI.
Any hints will be very appreciated.

PS. glSetFloatV is not declared in any of my /usr/include/GL files... I also 
do not find it in the PV source...

Subject: [Paraview] SafeDownCast to vtkDoubleArray fails
Message-ID: <BAY122-W33CCD1B394CE238957E961BC480@phx.gbl>


Hi!
I need to cast my Point Data to a vtkDoubleArray, but it fails:

vtkPointData *scaldat = input -> GetPointData();
vtkDoubleArray *scalars = vtkDoubleArray::New();
scalars = vtkDoubleArray::SafeDownCast(scaldat); 
if(!scalars) vtkErrorMacro("SafeDownCast to vtkDoubleArray failed");

and everytime I run the program I get that vtkErrorMacro. 
as far as I know from the input files, the PointData should be float, but casting to vtkFloatArray fails as well. Why? and what can I do about it?

thx a lot,
NH

PointData is not an array, it's a container of arrays. To get one of its 
arrays see the GetArray methods.
http://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkFieldData.html#888a6492210426d4ba4d358b87ab198f

To find this in the documentation you would have to use the inheritance 
diagrams. PointData "is a" DataSetAttibutes "is a" FieldData and so on.

Subject: [Paraview] dlopen question
Message-ID: <200809221022.49317.m.janssens@opencfd.co.uk>

In our code we use dlopen with RTLD_LAZY|RTLD_GLOBAL to optionally load 
additional libraries.

We noticed that this gives problems in the paraview reader. The same code 
which happily loads when running from the command line now gives undefined 
symbols when used through the reader.

E.g. the additional library libAdditional uses a symbol aaa from library 
libmain which is already a dependency of my application. (so 'ldd 
application' shows up libmain). My application does a dlopen of libAdditional 
and it all works fine.

Now when invoked in a reader (the reader itself I assume is loaded using 
dlopen into Paraview?) the dlopen of libAdditional complains about unresolved 
symbol aaa. Funnily enough it works if we first do a dlopen of libmain and 
then of libAdditional.

Is this related to the flags passed into dlopen? To complicate the matter, 
from what we heard, the problem does not appear on OSX.

Regards,

Mattijs

Hi!
Thx a lot, I get now a DataArray using 
getArr = scaldat ->GetArray(0); //I just have one array in my point data

But still the downcast to vtkDoubleArray fails, here is the code I used:

scaldat = input -> GetPointData();
vtkDataArray *getArr = vtkDataArray::CreateDataArray(VTK_DOUBLE);
getArr = scaldat -> GetArray(0);

 vtkDoubleArray *scalars = vtkDoubleArray::New();
scalars = vtkDoubleArray::SafeDownCast(getArr); //this downcast fails, i.e at runtime I get that warning below
 if(!scalars) vtkErrorMacro("SafeDownCast to vtkDoubleArray failed");


With the member function "IsTypeOf(char *classname)" I tried to find out if getArr is an array of a subclass of vtkDataArray, but this does not seem to be the case. getArr is just a vtkDataArray. But I need to access the values in it!!!

thx, 
NH

This is going to create a leak, because you ask for a New() an array 
then reassign your pointer to it before you call Delete().

Again this results in a leak for same reason.

There are a few reasons why the cast could fail. Do you know for sure 
that getArr is not null? Could you check to be sure the array in 
question is actually a double array? Try getArr->Print(cerr); That 
should give more info. If this happened to me I would open the code in a 
debugger and single step through this portion of the code examining 
variables to see they have the expected values.

Hi Sam and Paraview Community,

actually I have an older version of the Paraview's Guide, but it's still a good reference.

Huum...I still don't know if I should program a QT presonalized properties tab, or
if I should adopt the simplest solution; to change it through the XML of my filter.

I feel that QT code would give me more freedom to change the layout of the components, for instance, or to organize Widgets with borders, tabs and so on. Do you know if it's possible to do this kind of stuff through the XML ? 

And which method or class should I use to program the interaction of the ObjectPanel and The UnstructuredGrid displayed in the screen; if I choose the QT programming solution ?

Thanks again !
Rafael March.

Hello Rafael March,

If you have the ParaView Guide version 3 I've found chapter 18 on Server
Manager XML to be a good reference to all of the different tags that are
supported.  I haven't even had to write a custom GUI panel since the default
gadgets work well enough for most instances.

What kinds of gadgets are you using in your panel?

The general approach used by the ParaView developers is to use the
auto-generated panel from the XML unless there is something unique about the
filter that requires customization with C++/Qt code.

No, you generally do not have that level of control with the XML.  There are
some cases where you can get properties to group, for example when using 3D
widgets.

I'm not an expert on this, but I think the easiest thing to do if you want
to create your panel in Qt Designer is to first make sure that all your
widget names are consistent with the XML property names (use _X to refer to
a particular component of a vector property).  Then subclass
pqNamedObjectPanel.  In the constructor, setup the GUI and then call
this->linkServerManagerProperties().

Message-ID: <d0767b160809221028q60aaece4g83c254d0f7572d85@mail.gmail.com>

Hi folks.
Has anyone ever installed paraview on SGI Altix 4000? If I compiled
paraview with "PARAVIEW_USE_MPI" option setting to ON, the paraview
didn't work properly. For example, I first started the MPI version
pvserver on the supercomputer by issuing "DISPLAY=:0 mpirun -np 4
./pvserver --use-offscreen-rendering",  then I launched paraview
locally and connected it to the pvserver on the supercomputer.
Normally, at the center of paraview display area, there should have
three reference lines of a coordinate system. However, my paraview
just displayed a black square.
I have also tried the non-MPI version and the precompiled version of
Paraview. They worked fine. I don't know if the problem is MPI
implementation problem. I have heard that SGI's MPI implementation is
kind of different. However, other programs, such as glxgears, worked
fine by using the SGI implementation. Also, if I use the x forwarding
to start the MPI version of pvserver, the rendering result is also
correct. So, I am not quite convinced that the problem is MPI problem
and I am quiet confused.
I will highly appreciate any of your comments.
Thanks!

It sounds like it could be a rendering problem.  Perhaps the offscreen
rendering is misbehaving.  What happens when you run without the
--use-offscreen-rendering flag?

Thanks for you reply, Ken.
In stead of black square, the result is even more strange if I run
without the --use-offscreen-rendering flag. It is basically a huge
collection of random dots, and if I move the camera, the glxgears even
appears in the display.

It sounds like you are having a framebuffer readback issue.  Can you check
to see if your OpenGL drivers are up to date?

Subject: [Paraview] Early Registration Ends Sept. 30th!
Message-ID: <48D800E0.9070601@kitware.com>

Kitware is pleased to announce the next Developer's Training Week for 
VTK, ITK, ParaView and CMake, which will be held November 3-6, 2008 in 
Clifton Park, NY. Course details are provided below and online at 
http://www.kitware.com/products/protraining.html. Early Registration 
ends September 30th. Please contact courses at kitware.com with any questions.


Details
----------

The Developer's Training Week will cover our open-source projects 
including VTK, ITK, ParaView and CMake. These hands-on courses are 
appropriate for both new users wishing to quickly gain proficiency and 
experienced developers requiring advanced customization skills. The 
Developer?s Training Week is a great opportunity to meet some of the key 
contributors to these open-source projects as well as other users in the 
open source community.

The course runs Monday through Thursday, from 9am to 5pm. The course 
schedule is:

Software Overview: Monday AM
This session provides an introduction to VTK, ITK, ParaView, and CMake, 
and an overview of the open source communities, products, and services 
that support these projects.

VTK Track 1: Monday PM through Tuesday PM
Targeted for beginners, this session provides a basic understanding of 
the VTK pipeline mechanism and the rendering subsystem. Attendees are 
led through detailed examples to quickly gain a working knowledge of the 
visualization and data processing capabilities of VTK for various data 
types.

VTK Track 2: Monday PM through Tuesday PM
This session covers advanced topics in VTK including custom filter 
writing, information visualization, multi-block and composite data 
handling, time support, interaction and widgets, and parallel data 
processing.

CMake / CDash / CTest: Wednesday AM
Learn how you can use the open-source software process tools employed by 
VTK, ITK, and ParaView in order to quickly and easily build and test 
your own software projects in a heterogeneous computing environment.

ITK: Wednesday PM through Thursday PM
This session covers the basic architecture of ITK, the use of its image 
segmentation and image registration algorithms, the methods used for 
interfacing ITK to VTK, and the common techniques for integrating ITK 
into existing applications.

ParaView: Wednesday PM through Thursday PM
The first part of this session offers an introduction to ParaView from a 
user's perspective, providing you with the knowledge necessary to 
effectively process and visualize your data. The second part of the 
course is geared toward developers who would like to create custom 
functionality and incorporate it into ParaView.

As a course attendee, you will receive:
- Books / course notes for the sessions you attend
- Snacks and lunch daily
- A dinner reception on both Monday and Wednesday evening

The Registration Fees for the Developer's Training Week are:

On or before September 30th:
- $2500 for the four days or
- $750 per day

After September 30th:
- $3000 for the four days or
- $900 per day

No prior experience is necessary; however, attendees will need to have 
basic knowledge of C or C++ in order to fully participate in the 
interactive exercises.

Kitware courses incorporate both technical presentations and practical 
exercises designed to reinforce learning. Each attendee should bring 
their own laptop computer to the courses. Approximately two weeks before 
the course, attendees will receive detailed instructions on how to 
download, install and test all necessary software on their laptop 
computer. Any remaining issues will be resolved on-site during the 
Software Overview session on Monday morning.

The course registration form can be found at 
http://www.kitware.com/products/protraining.html. Additional information 
is available by emailing courses at kitware.com or by calling 518-371-3971.

Hi Ken.
Which OpenGL verison does paraview need? Also, by saying OpenGL
drivers, do you mean the GLX version of the supercomputer? Coz my
paraview server is running on a linux machine. The version of GLX on
the machine is 1.2. The latest GLX version is 1.4. Do I need to update
the glx to 1.4? Thanks!

Hi all.

 

I'm still quite new to Paraview. 

 

I want to ask how can I get stereo rendering function from Windows based
Paraview other that entering "paraview --stereo" command in Linux based
Paraview.

 

Thank you.

Message-ID: <C9C5F90AF4778B449CF1FC5A9BD9148905F12C@sbsserver.DigitalFlowSolutions.local>

Dear People,

  I am trying to open a file directly from vtk using the vtkFLUENTReader
class.

However I get a runtime error. Can anyone advise me what the problem is?

The code and error is below:

 

  vtkFLUENTReader* reader = vtkFLUENTReader::New();

  vtkMultiBlockDataSet* mb = vtkMultiBlockDataSet::New();

  char* cfname = "/fatty/Nat/testmeshes/nats-cube-all.cas";

  reader->SetFileName(cfname);

  reader->Update();

  mb->DeepCopy(reader->GetOutput());

  

 

ERROR: In /couchlocal/inkson/code/nvtk/VTK/Filtering/vtkExecutive.cxx,
line 403

vtkCompositeDataPipeline (0x1200020): Attempt to get data for output
port index 11133 for algorithm vtkFLUENTReader(0x11feb10), which has 1
output ports.

That looks like a bug. Can you set a breakpoint on where the error is
occurring (vtkExecutive.cxx:403) and follow the stack trace? Somehow,
something is trying to get something from output port 11133 instead of
0.

I just updated to 10.5.5. It seems to fix the issue. It must have been
a bug related to nVidia drivers.

I mean the vendor-specific graphics driver provided by your system.  Often
we find render specific problems that are attributed to bugs in the system
graphics drivers, which are typically updated at a much faster rate than the
OpenGL or GLX standard changes.

When we see a graphics problem like this, it is hard to determine the actual
cause.  Thus, the first course of action is usually to update the vendor's
graphics driver to rule that out.  If the problem persists, then we look
elsewhere.

I tried that Print(cerr), but I didn?t see anything printed on my console.. I hoped that would give me information to which class my getArr belongs. 
thats the line where I used it:

input -> GetPointData() -> GetArray(0) ->Print(cerr);

I do not know what I should try next..

I've never succeeded at getting ParaView to output to the console.  I 
usually just direct my debugging output to a log file.  If anyone has any 
tips for printing to stdout or stderr from within ParaView, I'd be 
interested to learn them.

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView on MacOSX 10.3.9?
Message-ID: <942369.2594.qm@web59511.mail.ac4.yahoo.com>

Hello again,

I'm trying to build a 10.3.9 installable version of ParaView 3.3.1 .  I've already replaced the part of the build script that used @loader_path with @executable_path .  I'm building on a newer system using the backward compatibility of the frameworks setup and the -mmacosx-version-min=10.3.9 flag.

One of my coworkers corrected a bug in vtkFreeType involving an incorrect verisioning preprocessor conditional.

Now it can't find the readline library in vtkLibXML2.  I need to know what other kinds of snags to expect and if I can get this done by the middle of next week.

Thanks for your consideration,

--Sam Crow

Hi Mattijs,

Not sure if this helps, but interestingly a VisIt guy had a very
similar problem around a week ago. You can follow the discussion by
searching for "help with dlopen" in
https://email.ornl.gov/pipermail/visit-developers/2008-September/thread.html .

The caveat is that he says RTLD_LAZY|RTLD_GLOBAL solved the problem
while apparently not in this case...

Message-ID: <89a581cc0809232234v70993857t1b4da62aa80b39aa@mail.gmail.com>

 Hi
I am using 2d structured mesh where "i" and "j" are in x and y
direction respectively. Now i want to plot a graph where "i" is
varying with constant "j" (for example, j=2, "i" varies from min to
max). Because if i need to plot temperature/gridconvergence_study near
the isothermal wall, using probe option i not able to do it correctly.
In tecplot i used to do very simple. Is it possible to do it in
paraFOAM ?. Or if you know any other simple method please share with
me.

Subject: [Paraview] Unstructured Grids
Message-ID: <BAY105-W50A7A7BD8BBB8A59EE52E9A6450@phx.gbl>


Hi

I am new to using Paraview and would like some assistance if possible.  I am researching particle dynamics and need to create files for unstructured grids. For the moment as I have just started all I have are particle locations, but I will later require several physcial variables for view.

So I have a problem in which X number of particles are initially static and after an initial shock the particles dissipate. I would like to view the simulation of this by a Paraview animation of the particle locations recorded at fixed time intervals.

What do I need to write in the vtk file for this , and why?

I am using Paraview 3.2.2

Thanks in advance

Chris

I'm on a project to add a new Reader to ParaView, and have successfully
gotten it working as a Plugin on linux.  Now I need to do this for Windows.

A few questions:
1) Can I compile my plugin as a DLL, that can be loaded with the downloaded
windows binary?
2) Is that version compiled with MinGW or Visual Studio?
3) If it's Visual Studio, can it use the QT compiled with MinGW? I see that
to get QT compiled with Visual Studio, I have to have the Commercial
Version, not the Open Source version.

Actually, the latest Qt 4.4.x supports the free versions of Visual
Studio so you can compile the OpenSource version of Qt with Visual
Studio Express.
The ParaView devs can answer the rest of the questions with more
authority but if you were to try to compile against the downloaded
version of ParaView you would have to match their version of visual
studio and Qt which is entirely possible.
I have found that compiling Qt 4.4.2 on windows is now straight
forward and the build of ParaView after that is just as straight
forward.. unless you have an older machine then it just takes a
llloooooonnnggg time to compile everything.
On my 2.6Ghz Core 2 Duo with 2GB ram I think Qt 4 is taking a few
hours to compile.

Last I heard, ParaView was very specific about requiring QT 4.3.5 .. Is this
no longer the case?

fyi, I need to compile PV3.2.3, not the latest CVS.

I think it complains with a warning. Qt 4.3.5 can be compiled with
VS2005 express and probably VS2008 Express although 2008 is not
"officially" supported. So basically pull the sources for Qt 4.3.5 and
compile with VS Express, then pull the PV sources and compile that.
Should work. I think I had that for a while in the summer without a
problem.

Subject: [Paraview] Unstructured Grids
In-Reply-To: <BAY105-W50A7A7BD8BBB8A59EE52E9A6450@phx.gbl>
Message-ID: <C4FFBAEB.1AE5%kmorel@sandia.gov>

That is a pretty open ended question.  Unstructured grids are defined by an
array of point coordinates and a separate array of cell topologies.  In your
case, the list of points will simply correspond to each particle, and each
cell will be a 0D cell (a vertex) that points to a single point.  There are
actually two types of unstructured data supported, poly data and
unstructured grid.  All things being equal, I would probably use the poly
data type because you won't have to identify each cell type.

ParaView supports multiple file formats for this type of data.  One you can
use is the legacy data format.  It's not an optimal file format, but it's
easy to make these files and the documentation is readily available from the
VTK User's Guide and the ParaView wiki
((http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/images/5/51/VTK-File-Formats.pdf).  This
format does not support time natively, but you can write out a sequence of
files with incremental numbering, and ParaView will read that as a time
series.  The files could look something like the following (with the <..>
replaced with an appropriate value).

Subject: [Paraview] python scripts
Message-ID: <48DA65E3.7080300@vt.edu>

Hi,
I've been writing some python scripts and running them through the 
paraview GUI. I start the scripts with

    from paraview import servermanager

When I use pvpython or pvbatch to run the same scripts I receive an error:

[project] pvpython paraview.py
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "paraview.py", line 1, in <module>
    from paraview import servermanager
  File "/home/project/paraview.py", line 1, in <module>
    from paraview import servermanager
ImportError: cannot import name servermanager


After messing with this for a while I finally tried:

    import servermanager

which worked.

Question: Why is there a difference in the way the servermanager is 
imported between paraview gui and pvpython/pvbatch? Have other people 
run across this issue? This is version 3.2.2. Is it possible there is 
something wrong my build? If this is something I just have to live with, 
is there a way to prevent the error from closing the script/interpreter, 
check to see if the first import failed and then run the second import?

Thanks,
Pat

That's weird.
from paraview import servermanager
should work from all the 3 locations client, pvbatch or pvpython.

Can you try the following script and print your path in all the three 
applications?

import sys
print sys.path

I created the script you posted. The results of each are displayed below:

pvpython ~/paraview-test-path.py

Interestingly, the only difference is the home directory at the

Any ideas?

In /home/project is there a "paraview.py" or a directory named 
"paraview" ? If so, try moving or renaming that.

It was my fault. I had named the scripts by the vis software being used 
so paraview.py, visit.py, etc. Changing it to pv.py fixed it.

Thanks very much for the help,
Pat

I have just been doing exactly the same thing myself.  I used the 
xml-based file format and the unstructured grid data type (*.vtu file).

Basically what I did was define four arrays in my code: points, 
connectivity, offsets and types.  Together these define the grid.  They 
each have length equal to the number of particles, np.

You can then fill these arrays like this (pseudocode):

for i=1 to np
  connect(i)=i-1
  offset(i)=i
  type(i)=1
  points(i)=particle(i).position
end

Then you can simply write the contents of these arrays in the 
appropriate places in the xml file.  You can also add other arrays 
containing the data for the physical variables you want to view.  I used 
the 'appended data' option and wrote the data out using raw binary 
encoding to make the files smaller and faster to read.

You write one of these *.vtu files for each time step, and then a *.pvd 
file containing the time data and links to each *.vtu file.

Email me if you need more detail.

Visual Studio 2003. If this is a pain for most people, I can switch to

For 3.2.X, you have to use the commercial Qt of the same version I
used. You can check the version from the help app (assistant) I
believe. I used the commercial binaries from the Trolltech web site.
There has been discussions on how to use the open-source Qt to build
plugins on the mailing list and if I remember correctly, it is
possible with some tweaking of Qt source.

People asked me to switch to the open-source Qt to build binaries. I
have been using those since 3.3. Open-source Qt can be built using
Visual Studio using the source from Trolltech's download page since
4.3. For older versions, see
http://paraview.org/Wiki/Obtaining_GPL%27ed_Qt_for_Windows. We will
have 3.4.0 very soon (in a week or two) so you may want to wait a bit.

Subject: [Paraview] volume render in pvpython
Message-ID: <48DB9D24.4090402@vt.edu>

Hi,
I am trying to use volume rendering through python interface. I have a 
script which loads a pvd file which references a large group of vtk 
unstructured grid files (.vtu). The script works fine except when I 
change the representation to 4 (volume) at which point it segfaults. If 
I load the data directly into paraview gui there is not an issue and if 
running the script in the gui I manually change the representation to 
volume after it has completed there is no problem. It appears to crash 
as soon as the representation is changed in the script as no window is 
opened.

The script is as follows:

**********************************************************************************
from paraview import servermanager

if not servermanager.ActiveConnection:
  connection = servermanager.Connect()

reader = 
servermanager.sources.PVDReader(FileName="/home/project/TurbDuctNetgen-Re1500/TurbDuctNetgen-Re1500.pvd")

pm = servermanager.ProxyManager()

source = pm.SMProxyManager.NewProxy("sources", "PVDReader")
pm.RegisterProxy("sources", "TurbDuctNetgen-Re1500.pvd", reader)

reader.UpdatePropertyInformation()
reader.TimestepValues

view = pm.GetProxy("views", "RenderView1")
if not view:
    view = servermanager.CreateRenderView()

rep = servermanager.CreateRepresentation(reader, view)
pm.RegisterProxy("representations", "proxyrep1", rep)

# Check which representation is being used
rep.Representation

# Check to see which representations are available
rep.Representation.NewDomainIterator().GetKey()
domain = rep.Representation.GetDomain( 
rep.Representation.NewDomainIterator().GetKey() )
for i in range( domain.GetNumberOfEntries() ):
    print domain.GetEntryValue(i), domain.GetEntryText(i)

rep.ColorAttributeType = 0
rep.ColorArrayName = 'p'
rep.Representation = 4 # Volume --> CRASH
view.StillRender()
view.ResetCamera()
view.StillRender()

servermanager.AnimateReader(reader,view)

**********************************************************************************

The output of the script for both pvpython and pvbatch (spews some 
additional error messages) when using volume:

Has anyone else run into this? Is there something special I need to do 
for volume rendering? Any ideas?

Subject: [Paraview] Problems combining Qt and VTK
Message-ID: <e4a2cf250809251019h4d00507fo3a7245108c540246@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

as part of my thesis i'm developing a gui combining qt and vtk in order to
visualize some models and interact with them. Now, having the basic
functionality (load model, rendering and manipulating in a certain way) of
the program already done i get several problems when i  unload a first model
and load a new one. This happens mostly when the file dialog opens and the
program crashes afterwards with a bus error.

Totalview shows the following:

Error in NSOutlineView _delayedFreeRowEntryFreeList]

or

Error in _objc_msgSend

Does anyone have an idea what could produce these errors?

Thank you very much.
Hector.

I see that vtkUndoSet::LoadState() is just a virtual "stub" method.

The comments preceding this method in the .h file say that subclasses 
are welcome to override this method to provide functionality.  Are 
there plans to provide a default implementation in the vtkUndoSet base 
class, in the future?

In other words, is this a conscious design choice, or just a feature that 
has not been implemented yet?

Thank you for any clarification you could offer!

The state loader (vtkSMUndoRedoStateLoader) takes over the 
responsibility for loading state for an undo-set since it needs to 
create the right type of undo-elements etc. Hence there's no default 
implementation provided.

I guess he's asking for a file format suitable to store transient 
solutions in unstructured grids and supported by ParaView. If so, 
there's a bunch of options (take a look at here 
http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView:FAQ#What_file_formats_does_ParaView_support.3F). 
The simplest choice, IMHO, is Ensight format.

Cheers

In ParaView, if I extract contours from a 2D image, is there any way to
annotate the values of those contour lines?  Kinda like a topographic
elevation map.

Subject: [Paraview] Off topic : Multiple Graphics cards (display:0
	display:1) on windows
Message-ID: <48DCED3C.60601@cscs.ch>

On linux, an X server will provide display:0, display:1 for two graphics 
cards on a single node. This works fine.

Can the same thing be done on windows in a reasonably straightforward 
manner?

I'd like to know if it's possible to have a dual/quad cpu machine with 
dual graphics cards and use 2 instances of pvserver as I would do under 
linux.

Google tells me that this extension WGL_NV_gpu_affinity exists, but I 
would expect we'd need to muck about inside vtkWin32OpenGlRenderWindow 
and/or related classes to make this work.

Has anyone any experience of this or similar technologies that would 
make the job easy/possible.

thanks

JB

Message-ID: <905310.98208.qm@web59501.mail.ac4.yahoo.com>

Hello,

I've created a custom panel in QT_Designer to replace an auto-generated panel that was too large on my reader.  The reader plugin currently compiles but when I load the plugin into ParaView, it still shows the auto-generated panel.

Making a child class of pqLoadedFormObjectPanel was fairly straightforward.  I'm pretty sure that all of the names in the custom panel line up with the server-manager XML so I am wondering why ParaView doesn't recognize the custom panel.  Do the XML domains listed in the ServerManager file need to be stripped off so that the GUI can supply its own?

Thanks for your time,

--Sam Crow

Here's a thought.  Does it need to be compiled with the Commercially licensed version of Qt to work?  I've downloaded a binary install of ParaView 3.3.1 from the official website and it didn't act any differently even though the official one was built with the commercial license of Qt.

Sometimes when this happens I blow away the GENERATED XML files from  
my plugin so that cmake can regenerate them and then recompile. No  
idea what the root cause of the problem is but _sometimes_ this fixes  
the issue.

Do you get an error message when the plugin tries to load?

Just in case you didn't know about this...
> to replace an auto-generated panel that was too large on my reader.  
you can hide some auto-generated options by using

     <Hints>
       <Property name="Refresh" show="0"/>
       <Property name="VariablesArrayStatus" show="0"/>
     </Hints>

inside the <sourceproxy> declaration. This is dead handy for removing 
stuff you don't want to see in the GUI.

Hi,

No error messages, but this time it didn't load the GUI plugins.  When I tried loading them manually they claimed they were built with an incompatible version of Qt.

I'm beginning to suspect that all of my experimentation with different versions of Qt is starting to catch up with me.  The panel was built with version 4.4.2 of Qt_Designer while compiled with 4.3.5 of the libraries.  I'll check into this and post back to the list if I find anything else out.

Means that one of the following is NOT matching:

Raw Qt Version 4.4.2 versus 4.3.5
Commercial versus Opensorce compiles
Debug versus Release binaries

ALL of those things MUST match for a plugin to load. Last Time I had  
that error I was trying to load a Debug version of a plugin against a  
release version of Qt.

I was wrong. 10.5.5 does not fix the issue. Can you try the attached
patch? You have to use patch -p1 to apply it.

Subject: [Paraview] Getting a custom panel to be recognized

Hi Mike,

Ok, I rebuilt and reinstalled Qt 4.4.2 from the source code (GPL version), reran CMake on ParaView, did a make clean, make -j, and sudo make install on Paraview.  I rebuilt my plugin linking against the version of ParaView I just built and installed it in the plugins directory inside the bundle in the directory that the executable is in.  The GUI plugins loaded this time and it still didn't show my custom panel.

Copying and pasting from previous responses:

I have found things the easiest with a google search with
"site:paraview.org" appended to the end...

The ParaView mailing-list is 'mirrored' (e.g) by: The Mailing list
ARChives (MARC)

<http://marc.info/?l=paraview&w=3> (paraview)
and maybe also interesting:
<http://marc.info/?l=vtk-developers&r=1&w=3> (vtk-developers)
<http://marc.info/?l=vtkusers&r=1&w=3> (vtkusers)

I will add this to the FAQ (I am working on a new one).

Post your GUI XML code for your plugin along with the c++ class names  
of the filters that should have the custom gui invoked.

Subject: [Paraview] Active Stereo
Message-ID: <48DD2761.4090500@arl.army.mil>

What's the current method to implement active stereo in Paraview (3.2.x 
or 3.4.x)?     I don't see any configuration option through ccmake, and 
an archive search points to a variety of different source file 
modifications, none of which seem to be consistent or current.

I'm a bit surprised that this is not a more easily configured option at 
compile time (or that multiple methods are supported).

ParaView3.x.x/VTK/Rendering/vtkRenderWindow.cxx and change the line 
starting with this->StereoType to

this->StereoType = VTK_STEREO_CRYSTAL_EYES;


Under some circumstances (mirrors and projector orientation) the stereo 
will be reversed. If so, you will need to modify the 
ParaView3.x.x/VTK/Rendering/vtkOpenGLCamera.cxx

I agree that it would be better as a simple configuration option - you 
might wish to add a feature request through their bug report system.

I will add this as a feature request.  Stereo really should be easier to configure.

Could you also add an option for VTK_STEREO_CRYSTAL_EYES_REVERSED or 
similar - 2 of our stereo walls have reversed stereo and requires 
switching several lines within 
ParaView3.x.x/VTK/Rendering/vtkOpenGLCamera.cxx to correct it.

Thanks,
Pat

Subject: [Paraview] How to open a render window with paraview python script
Message-ID: <30fc765f0809261553q2c6a814ciee548db1a56d2fad@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I want to know how can i make a paraview render window to stop closing after
its opening... Our method is to connect through the servermanager and load a
VTK file (via a dialog), but once loaded we have to make the thread to sleep
for some time to view its contents. I want to avoid sleeping the thread, i
want more like an embedded window or a side frame that never closes, so i
can have some interaction with it.

The code:


            sm.Connect()
            reader =
sm.sources.LegacyVTKFileReader(FileNames=dialog.GetPath())
            renWin = sm.CreateRenderView()
            rep = sm.CreateRepresentation(reader,renWin)
            renWin.StillRender()
            renWin.ResetCamera()
            renWin.StillRender()
            time.sleep(5)


Is there another place besides the Wiki where we can search for info about
python scripting and API?


Thanks in advance


Camilo

Thanks Takuya,

the thing I picked up from that discussion is to use RTLD_GLOBAL. Do you know 
which routine is doing the dlopen inside Paraview - would like to trace what 
is happening.

I'm not sure what you mean by extending to 2D and 3D.  Point coordinates are
always given in 3-space.

In-Reply-To: <48DCED3C.60601@cscs.ch>
Message-ID: <C5063922.1CA2%kmorel@sandia.gov>

As you have guessed, we have run pvserver on nodes with quad cores and dual
GPUs under Linux and got it working fine.  I don't think many people use
windows boxes for pvserver nodes (and I would personally discourage it in
general), so you might be on your own here.  Is it possible to have one
process create a window that spans the display of both graphics cards and
have the rest render offscreen?

I don't see the WGL_NV_gpu_affinity extension in the OpenGL extensions
registry, so it will probably be a while before it becomes available in
vtkgl/vtkOpenGLExtensionManager.  That's another stumbling block.

Sorry I don't have anything more constructive.

You can do it manually with the Text or 3D Text sources. You can also
select the lines and use selection labelling (at the bottom of the
Selection View) to display values from the selected points or cells.

After having exchanged a few messages off-list, Mike Jackson found an error in my CMakeLists.txt file that was causing it to use the default panel instead of my custom panel.  Now I have a blank panel instead.  Has there been any testing of whether it possible to have a custom panel on an externally loaded reader plugin using the pqLoadedFormObjectPanel class?

Also, there is a macro that Mike said was accessible to plugins being loaded in internally to the ParaView source called PARAVIEW_INCLUDE_GUI_RESOURCES.  Is there an equivalent for external plugins that we can use instead?

Have you looked at ParaView3/Examples/Plugins/GUIObjectPanel?
You're not getting the default panel anymore.. that's a sign that some of your 
code is now being called.  But did you give the correct string in the 
constructor of the pqLoadedFormObjectPanel?

Hello Clinton,

Thanks for the pointer to the example.  QT4_ADD_RESOURCE and the associated .qrc file was what I was looking for.

Message-ID: <b02264720809290838g5b71578ey88156b79b610d18f@mail.gmail.com>

I've written a VTK File Reader that supports multiple timesteps (48 in my
tests).  But when I load the data, it shows me no timestep data in the
properties panel, and the time increment thing at the top toolbar is greyed
out.  However, if I use the Animation tools to animate from timestep0 to 47
in 48 steps, it properly animates through time.

What am I doing wrong?  My RequestInformation (where I think this
information comes from) is shown below:

//----------------------------------------------------------------------------
int vtkAdhfaNetwork::RequestInformation(
  vtkInformation* reqInfo,
  vtkInformationVector** inVector,
  vtkInformationVector* outVector
  )
{
  if(!this->Superclass::RequestInformation(reqInfo,inVector,outVector))
    {
    return 0;
    }

  vtkInformation *info=outVector->GetInformationObject(0);
  double tRange[2];
  tRange[0] = this->Steps[0];
  tRange[1] = this->Steps[this->NumSteps-1];
  info->Set(
    vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::TIME_RANGE(),
    tRange,
    2);
  info->Set(
    vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::TIME_STEPS(),
    this->Steps,
    this->NumSteps);
  return 1;
}

Did you add the special TimestepValues property to the reader's server
manager XML definition?

     <DoubleVectorProperty name="TimestepValues"
                           repeatable="1"
                           information_only="1">
       <TimeStepsInformationHelper/>
       <Documentation>
         Available timestep values.
       </Documentation>
     </DoubleVectorProperty>

Ok, that gets it to display 2 timesteps (0 and 1).  How do I get it to
display all 48 so that the user can flip between them with the spinner up
top?

It still works with the Animation view if I manually configure it to show 48
frames between 0 and 47.

Uhhhh... I dunno.  It should report all of the time steps.  Are you sure
your RequestInformation method is reporting all of the time steps, and not
just 2?

Seems that was the final issue.  I was initializing those variables in
RequestData, but RequestInformation is called before then.  I wound up
simply making RequestInformation call RequestData, and now it works! :)

I think the patch is working for me.  Once I applied it, the update seemed
to be happening normally.  I'll leave it in and let you know if I have
further problems.

Having gone through this a few times myself, is there a way in the  
RequestInformation to get the Time information from the file? On some  
of my custom files that involved opening the file to do a partial read  
just to get the time information (and a few other pieces of  
information) for the pipeline.

I have some source code that you can look at if you need it.

Not really, no.  This reader is a bit unusual because it's not really a
reader.  It reads a simple 2D Geometry from disk, and then uses 2 other
files to run a Neural Network simulation on that grid.  The number of
timesteps isn't known until after the network is run, which requires all
files to be loaded from disk.

Message-ID: <200809301244.48944.mueller@tmfs.mpgfk.tu-dresden.de>

Hi all,
I want to visualize simple 3d voxel data: creating iso surfaces, slices etc... 
First interactive and later in batch mode.
As the data sets tend to get quite large (up to 1000x1000x1000 voxels) I 
probably have to use some parallel computation. pvserver/pvbatch seem the 
right tools for this, but the computing nodes don't have graphic cards I can 
use. So I tried compiling pvserver with osmesa and using 
the --use-offscreen-rendering switch. I tried some combinations of paraview 
version/mesa-lib with and without mpi. It's always the same:
Stand alone paraview can open the (small) test files und display everything I 
want. When using the client/server mode, the server crashes at the point when 
more than a simple outline of the data has to be displayed.

Can somebody give instructions how to get a working pvserver fpr use without 
without graphics hardware (versions, linux distribution, compiler version)? 
Maybe I could build this system in virtual machine, just to have a valid 
starting point.
I'm using ubuntu, amd64, 7.10 

thank you
Robert Mueller

      hi, my self-compiled paraview met little problems.

      with the help of the main GUI, through command line , like
mpiexec -np ....

      I could not start the pvserver on the other system.

      but if the server was started manully, the client could connect
the server.

      so could some gave some tip.

      thanks

Message-ID: <28C9400C-2069-4F56-916E-4F2BB3D8D5D6@bluequartz.net>

I put together a quick command line app that takes a number of inputs  
and then generates a project directory with CMakeLists.txt file and  
associated source and xml files that build into a ParaView 3 plugin.  
If any one is interested in the code I can post it somewhere. I wanted

Maybe a nice utility to include with ParaView. The goal is to make  
creating plugins even easier.

Subject: [Paraview] Interaction between customized ObjectPanel and Model
	Display
Message-ID: <232865.57648.qm@web110109.mail.gq1.yahoo.com>

Hey folks,

I'm programming a plugin that has a customized ObjectPanel, which I'm designing with QT Designer. I am able to include Widgets and link them with the ServerManager Properties. Everything works just fine.

I was just wondering, how could I interact with my model WITHOUT hitting the "apply" button. In my case, for instance, I have a comboBox which enumerates a list of integer values. It would be really nice, if when I choose a number, I could get the cells which have this value as a scalar property selected, or just colored in a different manner. I mean automatically, without having to hit the "apply" button of the filter to process the state of the comboBox. 

How can I do this? I can't see a connection between my customized panel class (which contains QT code and extends pqLoadedFormObjectPanel) and my filter class.

Thanks,
Rafael March.

If you have 3.3 or later, you can clip with a sphere and a box.

Are your pvservers 32 or 64 bits? If your pvserver's were compiled with 
32 bits, my guess is that, you can't load piece of models with more than 
4GB.

It's just my guess since I don't know exactly how PV works in these 
cases. Note that you can have the whole model in just 1 file or split in 
several files using a parallel file format like Xdmf. In the first case, 
pvserver should be able to load the entire model before partitioning 
among the other processes. In the second case, each process should be 
able to load its piece of model without relying in huge memory requirements.

(it's just my 2 cents for the subject... the other PV guys could clarify 
this question better...)

I believe you can access the VTK object(s) indirectly with the vtkSMProxy
object returned from pqLoadedFormObjectPanel::proxy().  In general, your
object panels will not have direct access to the VTK objects they control
(that is, you cannot get pointers to the VTK objects) because they are
frequently not on the same process as the GUI.
