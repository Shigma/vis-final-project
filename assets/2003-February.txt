Dear: Sir/Madam:


I have just installed Paraview on PC Win2000, and start trying it.

Could anyone tell me  How to do animation script in Paraview.

Message-ID: <3E43AFA6.7060501@free.fr>

Hi all,
   I have just updated Paraview and VTK. But there a bug while using 
cmake for Paraview.
For some bizarre reason there was a final closing parenthesis ')' that 
cmake didn't like at all in:

VTKBin/VTKLibraryDepends.cmake

Here is the original message:
Parse error.
CMake Error: Error in cmake code at
/home/malat/Kitware/VTKBin/VTKLibraryDepends.cmake:36:
Parse error.

Removing it seems to be the solution.

ParaView doesn't make any calls to require system resources nor
does it ever ask to be run a certain processor (it can't anyway,
there is no such standard MPI call). Therefore, it will use whatever
the operating system and/or the MPI library gives it. Of course,
unless you are doing some expansive computation, there is no reason
why ParaView should use all the processor time available. It will
idle until it is asked to compute something. This might be true
even if you are interacting with an object since, when using hardware
accelerated rendering, the graphics processor will take the
actual load.

I have also been unable to find any documentation on the ParaView

You are right. We changed the process we use to create the documentation
and it looks like I only put the Windows compiled help file in the CVS
tree. Just download a binary distribution and get it from there. When
you unpack the tar file, you'll get
share/ParaView/Documentation/ParaViewDocumentation.pdf
as part of the distribution.

Thanks for the reply Berk. My issue turned out to not be a problem after
all. Apparently, newer Xeons and Linux kernels support hyperthreading, =
so
each node in my cluster is actually reporting (/proc/cpuinfo) 4 logical
processors (2 physical) to MPICH and ParaView, thus the 25% maximum cpu
usage/process.

I am curious if anyone has benchmarked ParaView with/without =
hyperthreading.
Does anyone have any recommendations as to whether it should be on or =
off?

Hi,
I'm trying to add a new VTK source for ParaView. I found the XML files 
describing user sources and I see them appear in ParaView menus when 
modifying the XML.

The first problem is that I can't find any documentation on the XML and 
it's DTD. And the second one is that I don't know where to put my 
compiled VTK class and how to relate it with the XML description.

If somebody could give me an example or point me to a documentation it 
would be great.

Thanks

Hello All,

I am using Paraview in order to visualize
scalar (vector) fields produced by a parallel program.

Each processor currently outputs its own *.vtk
file, which corresponds to the value of the fields
in the subdomain it's been allocated.

I would like to know if there is a way of merging
these *vtk files into one large vtk file that I would
then visualize using Paraview.

Alternatively, I would like to know if Paraview
can merge these datasets after having loaded each one of them
separately.

Thanks in advance,

Alex.

I am a bit confused about what each file contains. They
each contain part of the data (in space), right ?

Alex,

I assume (Berk's question) that each sub domain is a separate spatial 
partition and each file has the same arrays (different geometry).

I do not know what type of data you are handling (unstructured grid, 
structured grid ...)

Here are your options:

1:  Use VTK to append all the datasets into one big file.
         vtkAppendFilter will create a single output (unstructured grid).
         vtkAppendPolyData is the same but takes polydata input and 
produces polydata output.

2: Make a pvtk (extension .pvtk) XML file that looks like this:

<File version="pvtk-1.0"
       dataType="vtkUnstructuredGrid"
       numberOfPieces="2" >
   <Piece fileName="ghost.0.vtk" />
   <Piece fileName="ghost.1.vtk" />
</File>

This file groups the subfiles so ParaView reads them as one.  This XML file 
is a little more complicated for structured data sets, but not much.



In the near future, ParaView (1.0) will be able to append datasets from the 
user interface.

Charles.
