I had a colleague have a quick look over the code and they found the issue.
I was deleting test (which was a pointer to the current data object) when I
shouldn't have been, which is why the iterator gave a segmentation fault.
Sorry for wasting your time on this.

GoToFirstItem() and InitTraversal() are almost equivalent, so that should
not matter. What's happening in "//do something here". Are you sure test
remains valid at the end of it?

Subject: [Paraview] Packaging branded apps on Windows
Message-ID: <17A18008-E468-4499-879C-3E465B164E99@cs.duke.edu>

Hello,

I've recently been forced... no, no, encouraged to try to build and package my branded PV app under Windows 7 64-bit, and I'm not experienced with building in a Windows environment. (I'm using Visual Studio 2008 Pro.) I think I have CVS ParaView built just fine.

But, when I run CMake on my branded project it has trouble with one of the CPack portions, so I get:

CMake Error at C:/Users/emonson/Programming/ParaView_cvs/ParaView3/CMake/ParaViewBrandingCPack.cmake:124 (INSTALL):
  install FILES given no DESTINATION!
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  MSI_Strip3/CMakeLists.txt:110 (install_qt_libs)

It seems to not have PV_INSTALL_BIN_DIR set... I'm sorry for my continued CMake ignorance, but should that variable have carried over from my ParaView build somehow, or should I be setting it explicitly in my CMakeLists.txt file for the project?

I tried changing it to CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX just to get past the error, but then the Qt libs don't get packaged properly.

Thanks for the help,
-Eric

The problem is due to the fact that install_qt_libs() incorrectly uses
internal ParaView variable : PV_INSTALL_BIN_DIR. I'll fix that
shortly. Until then feel free to set PV_INSTALL_BIN_DIR to "bin".

 SET(PV_INSTALL_BIN_DIR bin)

Thanks a lot for the explanation, eventual fix and current workaround! 

Now I need to figure out why not all of my plugins will build on Windows... :(

Talk to you later,

Subject: [Paraview] Branded plugin libraries packaging
Message-ID: <BB2839BA-6D8C-48D6-8E5E-973A5B6240DD@cs.duke.edu>

Hey folks,

A more general branded app packaging question:

Is there any automatic mechanism in place to package plugin libraries with our branded apps? Right now I have a list of EXTRA_DEPENDENCIES in my build_paraview_client() section, and I build my plugins into my MainWindow class using the PV_PLUGIN_IMPORT macro stuff. But, for packaging I have written extra INSTALL rules for all of the plugin libraries in a platform-specific way like:

IF (APPLE)
  INSTALL(FILES 
          ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/../CellGlyphPlugin/libCellGlyphPlugin.dylib
         DESTINATION ${PV_INSTALL_LIB_DIR}
         COMPONENT BrandedRuntime)
ENDIF (APPLE)
IF(WIN32 AND NOT UNIX)
  INSTALL(FILES 
          ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/../CellGlyphPlugin/Release/CellGlyphPlugin.dll
         DESTINATION ${PV_INSTALL_LIB_DIR}
         COMPONENT BrandedRuntime)
ENDIF(WIN32 AND NOT UNIX)

Since the system knows which libraries are needed and where they are for linking, is there any way it can know for installation/packaging, too?

If not, that's fine, but I just wanted to make sure I wasn't doing it the manual way if a more automatic solution was in place.

Thanks,
-Eric

A quick workaround is as follows:
* Set the PV_INSTALL_PLUGIN_DIR before your ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN calls.
That will add install rules to install the plugin with component
"Runtime".

Hey Utkarsh,

It's all getting packed fine on Windows now, except for one library. I built the ParaView I'm building my branded app against with Python turned ON, but python26.dll isn't getting packaged in my NSIS installer. (All of the Python stuff seems to get packaged just fine on Ubuntu.)

Is there something I should add to my CMakeLists.txt file to make this happen properly?

Thanks a lot -- getting closer... :)
-Eric

When I build ParaView releases I have to inject extra install rules like
this. Note that this is from ParaView 3.6 so the variable names have
changed.

  INSTALL(FILES C:/Python25/python25.dll
    DESTINATION ${PV_EXE_INSTALL}
    PERMISSIONS OWNER_WRITE OWNER_READ OWNER_EXECUTE GROUP_READ
GROUP_EXECUTE WORLD_READ
    COMPONENT Runtime)

Also note that merely putting the Python.dll won't include all the
python modules. You'll have to add custom rules to package whole of
python. Unless your custom app relies on python I'd recommend
compiling ParaView without python or asking the user to install Python
using the installables provided at python.org

Also, depending on which compiler you are using, you may have to package
python's msvcr90.dll dependency (and manifest!)

Thanks, both of you, for the advice. I was just wondering how packaging would work with some of the newer Programmable Filter functionality relying on Numpy, and I think this makes it more clear.

I really appreciate all the help,

Thanks, Pat. You know, sometimes I start to feel like these "learning new skills" and "becoming competent at your job" things aren't all they're cracked up to be. :)

I appreciate all the tips. Take care.

Hello.

A short question: what is the algorithm that the contour filter uses? Is it
Marching Cubes or it's something very different?

Thank you,

Dear Berl,
I'm still struggling to compile 3.6.2!
 When I'm done with that I will take a look at the new one.

For the moment I did a programmable filter that return directly the 
difference of the two scalars (find it attached below), I'm still trying 
to validate its results.

Thanks for your help!
Luca

-----------------------------------------------
i0 = self.GetInputDataObject(0,0)
i1 = self.GetInputDataObject(0,1)
o = self.GetOutputDataObject(0)

input0=i0.GetPointData().GetArray("meanTotalPressureMonitor")
input1=i1.GetPointData().GetArray("meanTotalPressureMonitor")

outputData = vtk.vtkDoubleArray()
outputData.SetName("diffTotalPressure")

numCell = i0.GetNumberOfPoints()
for i in range(numCell):
    val = input0.GetValue(i) - input1.GetValue(i)
    outputData.InsertNextValue(val)

o.GetPointData().AddArray(outputData)

Hi All,
I want to visualize the difference between two data sets and plot the
error on one data set as the reference. Currently, I have 2 structured
grid data sets of the same gemoetry; and 2 unstructured point cloud data
sets.
Are there any filters in ParaView for this purpose? Thanks a lot.

Best,
xunlei

Are you trying to do this in parallel?

Message-ID: <FBE90478-2B01-4648-8F91-7A30A30AE506@lmt.ens-cachan.fr>

Hello everyone,

I'm using paraview 3.6.2, I'm trying to generate RectilinearGrid data  
(using  the programmable source),  the data for the construction come  
from 2 rectilinearGrid (vtk files), so I have to have access to the  
LegacyVTKFileReader class.

The problem is that, inside the programmable source, I don't have  
access to the reader (servermanager is not available), and if I import  
vtk the readers are not available neither.

any idea???

problem : reading legacy vtk files inside the programmable source

Thanks

Can't you use programmable filter with 2 reader inputs?

No, because I may have more than 2 files (3 ... 20 ...).

In reality I have a N dimension solution (space, time, parameters)   
and I want to generate a solution in 3D fixing the position of the  
other dimensions (and maybe putting one in dimension in the time).

I have my own file format (a very simple xml) with the description of  
the solution.

The idea is to test the visualization, and then write a real reader  
(in c++).

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<root>
	<PGD_dim
		id="1"
		name="Time"
	        dim="1"
        	 	file="Time.vtk"
	/>
	<PGD_dim
		id="2"
		dim="2"
         	name="SpaceXY"
		file="Space_2D.vtk"
	/>
	<PGD_dim
		id="3"
		dim="1"
         	name="SpaceZ"
		file="Space_1D.vtk"
	/>
	<PGD_dim
		id="4"
		dim="3"
         	name="ForceXYZ"
		file="Force_3D.vtk"
	/>
...
</root>

In that case, do this:

from paraview.vtk import io

r = io.vtkDataSetReader()

Keep in mind that vtkDataSetReader() is a VTK class and it will have a
different interface than the LegacyVTKFileReader class. Look at VTK
doxygen for the full API documentation.

Hi Berk,
Ideally, I would like to have pvserver in the back to handle large scale
data sets. But for now, speed is not an issue. And I know how to do
multiview to show two data sets side-by-side with linked camera. I
currently do not have the difference between data sets pre-computed, and
would like to use some ParaView features to handle that.
Thanks for your help.

Best,
x

The best way that I can think of doing this is to map the particle
data onto the structured mesh and then use the programmable filter to
compute the difference on the mesh. Have you thought about how that
would be done? You can use the delaunay filter to first create an
unstructured mesh from the particle data and then use the resample
filter to map that onto the structured mesh. That would obviously make
certain assumptions about how the field represented by the particles
is interpolated. The alternative is to use the closest point. What do
you think?

Hi Berk,
I was playing with programmable filter feature. Do you have any
tutorial/examples that I can follow? My initial test would be on two
structured mesh with the same geometry but different size. So I can skip
the delaunay filter. After I am done with the resample filter, how can I
compute the difference of two scalar fields from two data sets?

On another novice ParaView user issue, I would like to plot the vector
field or arrow glyphs from the structured grid data where I stored say
velocity info. as 3 individual fields vx, vy, vz in HDF5 and XDMF. I
tried Glyph filter. But I don't know how to use it (arrow) to represent
vx, vy, vz.

Thanks a lot for your help.

Best,
x

Hi Andy,

Sorry to bother you again. I have read the co-processing source code and
some python scripts used by co-processing library. As far as I am concerned,
 the python scripts just set up a VTK pipeline and do some data processing
,but do nothing about parallel rendering and image compositing . (It is very
probable that I am wrong , but I really do not get it. Given  the Server
Manager plays an essential role in parallel rendering and compositing, it
seems to be very difficult to manipulate SM in the python scripts  ). If the
python scripts just do some processing, then why is python necessary?  Just
to provide a more flexible pvbatch?

I have a naive idea that I design a source that fetches data from the
simulation side and  updates the pipeline periodically, then ParaView will
handle the rest for me :)  Is this way feasible?

Best regards,

-Ning

Hey Xunlei,

So, you probably know that you can just highlight both data sets and then apply the Python Programmable Filter (PPF) and it will take multiple inputs. 

If you are working from CVS ParaView compiled with Python support and have Numpy installed, you can compare attributes of two data sets with the same geometry by putting something like this in the PPF script pane:

elev0 = inputs[0].PointData['Elevation']
elev1 = inputs[1].PointData['Elevation']
output.PointData.append(elev1 - elev0, 'difference')

Here I had two cones that each had the Elevation filter applied. If I had two cones, one of which is a linearly transformed version of the other, I could get the difference vectors for each of the points like this:

pts0 = inputs[0].Points
pts1 = inputs[1].Points
output.PointData.append(pts1-pts0,'translation')

I'm still not up on all of the new API for this, so Berk can fill in more, but maybe that can get you started?

Regarding getting a vector from the individual components, you can use the Calculator filter with something like this as the equation:

vx*iHat + vy*jHat + vz*kHat 

and it will create a three-component vector result. Then, you can glyph the data with arrows which are oriented along those vectors.

Talk to you later,
-Eric

Subject: [Paraview] Python - StructuredGridReader
Message-ID: <4BB85C11.5050808@rwth-aachen.de>

Hi!

I wonder how I can use a StructuredGridReader from within Python. I need 
to read .vti volume files, but Python says:

> >> help(StructuredGridReader)

Traceback (most recent call last):

File "<console>", line 1, in <module>

NameError: name 'StructuredGridReader' is not defined



I have read the Paraview Tutorial, where the ExodusIIReader ist used. 
This works without a problem:

> >> help(ExodusIIReader)

Help on function CreateObject in module paraview.simple:

CreateObject(*input, **params)

The Exodus reader loads Exodus II files and produces an unstructured 
grid output. The default file extensions are .g, .e, .ex2, .ex2v2, .exo, 
.gen, .exoII, .exii, .0, .00, .000, and .0000 .



What am I doing wrong?

Best regards,
Christian

I used the Trace functionality in the Python Shell to figure out that I 
need a XMLImageDataReader for that task.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Subject: [Paraview] Auto-Execute Plugin on Selection
Message-ID: <4BB9B660.6060801@rwth-aachen.de>

Hi!

I'd like to know if there is a way to execute a macro on a certain 
event, e.g. when the user does a selection in the 3D viewer. The problem 
is that I have to select several object out of many candidates. Of 
course, I could just do a multiselection with using the Ctrl key, but 
for reasons of usability it has to be prevented that a selection can get 
lost. Take a look at the attached image and imagine you were analyzing 
this dataset for quite a while and already selected several objects with 
a multi select. On the next object you forget to press the control key 
while selecting... Bad luck... Everything is gone. You may start all over.
So I thought maybe I could call a plugin whenever a selection is done. 
This plugin could just look up the x,y,z coordinates of the selection, 
which would already do the job for me. If this is not possible, would it 
be worthwhile looking into the source to ruthlessly "hack" this into 
Paraview?
Or does somebody have any other good idea?

Maybe it would be nice to turn multiselection permanently on/off!

Best regards,
Christian

Hey Christian,

Hopefully someone more clever and experienced than I am can think of a way for you to do what you want, but I'm not sure that it's possible with how ParaView deals with selections right now.

As the ParaView developers consider how to improve the usability of the program in future revisions, I think it might not hurt to look at the way PV deals with selections and selection tools. VTK and PV development in recent years has added more capabilities for interactive probing and exploration of data, in addition to the more traditional scientific visualization tasks. Of course, performance on huge data sets will always have to be a top priority in PV development, but I think users who are used to any other interactive software for exploring data are surprised by the awkwardness of the selection procedure: 1. There is no persistence of the selection tools. 2. If the Selection Type is anything other than IDs for selecting "on" or Frustum for "through", you have to keep re-choosing another option (like Global IDs) from the Selection Inspector after each selection. 3. If a filter takes a selection, there is no way to automatically use the active selection, there is only the Copy Active Selection button. 4. There is no idea of selecting "objects", whether that be pipeline objects or geometric objects like spheres or cubes. 

For my users, then, this means each time they want to make a selection to explore a different part of the data, they have to re-activate the proper selection tool, make a selection, change the Type to Global IDs, click in the pipeline to activate the selection-using filter, then copy the active selection. It's a bit ponderous, and they don't have the perspective of why these interaction choices were made in the context of visualizing huge SciVis data sets, they just want to be able to explore their data more naturally.

Anyway, please forgive me if you feel I've misused your thread for my more general statements, but I keep meaning to put Selections forward as a new topic for ParaView usability concerns.

Take care,
-Eric

Message-ID: <m2v898447c41004050900j7c60bb31saf038d19e087e94c@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm experiencing weird behaviour when trying to compile a plugin that works
with ParaView 3.6.2 x86-32 distributed in the Website.

I've downloaded Qt-4.3.5 opensource and compiled it, downloaded ParaView's
3.6.2 sourcecode and compiled with Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 9.0.30729.1
- SP1, in Release mode. Compiled my plugin with the same compiler, also in
Release Mode, and generated the dll without problems. So, I load it with
ParaView and apply my filter to my Unstructured Grid. Then, I get some
"random" crashes, when I click in some Qt widgets in my Object Panel. I say
random because sometimes the Qt widgets work and sometimes don't. At all, an
totally unstable behaviour is obtained.

So, I compiled ParaView, same version, in debug mode to debug the crashes,
but everything run just fine in ParaView debug ! I tryied the same procedure
in other machines, and exactly the same happens in the release mode. Also,
the same happens in x64 environment. It used to work fine with ParaView
3.4.0, but with 3.6.2 just in debug mode.

What might be happening ?

Thanks in advance,
Rafael Neto.

Try using dependency walker http://www.dependencywalker.com/ to check
what dlls are brought it. It may help identify the issue.

I would like to work with the ParaView 3.8 branch. What is the  
"official" way to get the code? Git or CVS? The Git server at GitHub  
seems NOT to have all the source code for the branch. Is the CVS  
server still active?

Thanks

The official way is to use cvs until the transition occurs. I am using cvs
for building the 3.8 release binaries because cvsexport is just another
level of complexity I don't want to deal with, especially for merging fixes
onto the branch. I am not certain why GitHub didn't import the entire branch
but it is going to be disabled soon anyway.

Mike,

We are working on the official ParaView/VTK Git repositories. These
will soon replace the current github repository. Though may still be
co-hosted on gitorious and/or github, it will have a totally different
history from the current version.
Until that happens, the current github repo may not get maintained.
The official way still remains CVS for another week or so. We will
have a fresh/clear announcement when the migration to git happens.

Hello,

I'm trying to generate data in the programmablesource with time.

till now a can produce the data, fill the output, but I do not know  
how to put the time information. (I read that I have to correctly set  
the DATA_TIME_STEPS, TIME_RANGE, TIME_STEPS and the TimestepValues  
variables).
But I don't know how.


And also how read the UPDATE_TIME_STEPS to generate the correct data  
for the current time.

right know I see only the  
self.GetRectilinearGridOutput().DATA_TIME_STEPS() variable, (I have to  
create the others ??? how and were (inputs, ouput, self ???))

Thanks

Felipe Bordeu

That's crazy :-)

You need something like this:

for i in range(x):
 self.GetExecutive().GetOutputInformation().GetInformationObject(0).Append(vtkStreamingDemandDrivePipeline.TIME_STEPS(),
t[i])

in the RequestInformation() script. Then to get UPDATE_TIME_STEPS(),
something like:

i = self.GetExecutive().GetOutputInformation().GetInformationObject(0)
nSteps = i.Length(vtkStreamingDemandDrivePipeline.UPDATE_TIME_STEPS())
tSteps = []
for i in range(nSteps):
 tSteps.append(i.Get(vtkStreamingDemandDrivePipeline.UPDATE_TIME_STEPS(), i))

Good luck!

Message-ID: <EC6501D4A6BB5442B583E3FABC9D131F1957A2C1@exchange.ad.acadiau.ca>


Hi,

I am trying to read in a netCDF file using Paraview 3.6.2.  It can 'see' the netCDF file, but when I attempt to read in the file by pressing 'Apply', I get the following error message:  

ERROR: In /home/kitware/ParaView3/Utilities/BuildScripts/ParaView-3.6/ParaView3/Servers/Filters/vtkTexturePainter.cxx, line 280
vtkTexturePainter (0xb8a0000): Incorrect dimensionality.

I'm not sure which netCDF release created the netCDF file.  However, I read in a previous post that paraview 3.6.1 could handle netCDF 4, and since  "all netCDF files ever written can always be read by the latest netCDF release. That is, we guarantee backward data compatibility" then 3.6.2 should be able to handle my netCDF file (which wasn't created too recently).

I can read the netCDF file into MATLAB, so it isn't corrupt.

So what's the problem?

thanks
Joel

Message-ID: <m2sce609b741004061053td6d7371dr737cc71b5531bc4@mail.gmail.com>

I have a bit of code where I read in a data file, extract a small portion of
it and then integrate the variables of the extracted portion.  In my python
code I then fetch the data from the server with the intent to write it out
to a log file.  The issue that I have come across is when I run my script in
the Python Shell it gives me <0,0,0> for my tuple.  Then if I repeat the
final four lines interactively in the Python Shell starting with the fetch
command I get a proper result of <0.14, 0.5, 0>.  Any ideas why I can't
fetch the data properly in the script but can right after in interactively?

The script looks like:

#**********************************************************8
#Do X-direction
xscale = 1.0
yscale = 1.0/(2*ymax)
zscale = 1.0/zmax

print "load Fluid"
fluid = XMLPolyDataReader(FileName=xSlice)
fluid.PointArrayStatus = ['U', 'p']
RenderView1 = GetRenderView()
DataRepresentation1 = Show()

print "extract Block"
fluidBlock = ExtractCellsByRegion(Input = fluid, IntersectWith = "Box")
fluidBlock.IntersectWith.Scale = [xscale, yscale, zscale]
DataRepresentation2 = Show()

print "integrate"
avgData = IntegrateVariables(Input = fluidBlock)
DataRepresentation3 = Show()
Render()

data = servermanager.Fetch(avgData,0)
pointData = data.GetPointData()
avgVar = pointData.GetArray(0).GetTuple3(0)
print avgVar

Try calling avgData.UpdatePipeline().  The filters are not actually executed
until there is demand.  Usually a call to Render() causes this demand, but
for IntegrateVariables there is nothing to render.  Not sure if Fetch is
supposed to automatically called UpdatePipeline or not.

Pat,
Thanks for the reply.  I tried giving an UpdatePipeline() call, but seemed
to be the same result.

Any other thoughts?

It sounds like you are reading in an array with 0 or 1 dimensions (not including time).  Although the reader should happily create an image data of that structure, the standard rendering views only understand image data of 2 or 3 dimensions.  Hence you get the error.

If you want to see the data in a plot, try adding the "Plot Data" filter.

Hi,

I am trying to read in a netCDF file using Paraview 3.6.2.  It can 'see' the netCDF file, but when I attempt to read in the file by pressing 'Apply', I get the following error message:

ERROR: In /home/kitware/ParaView3/Utilities/BuildScripts/ParaView-3.6/ParaView3/Servers/Filters/vtkTexturePainter.cxx, line 280
vtkTexturePainter (0xb8a0000): Incorrect dimensionality.

I'm not sure which netCDF release created the netCDF file.  However, I read in a previous post that paraview 3.6.1 could handle netCDF 4, and since  "all netCDF files ever written can always be read by the latest netCDF release. That is, we guarantee backward data compatibility" then 3.6.2 should be able to handle my netCDF file (which wasn't created too recently).

I can read the netCDF file into MATLAB, so it isn't corrupt.

So what's the problem?

thanks
Joel

Another interesting anomaly.  If I use the shell and run the script once, so
I have a pipeline of three objects, I get zeros.  If I then run it again
immediately  so I have a second pipeline of the same three objects, it then
outputs correctly.

Message-ID: <m2zc4a1f7841004061651ifc99829fybb5c7f151f8324b0@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I've been trying to generate a development tree of ParaView (based on
CVS head as of a few hours ago) that I can distribute to other
in-house developers so that they don't have to build ParaView
themselves. I've been following the instructions here:
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView:Build_And_Install#Install_ParaView

I have set the CMake variables as described (with
PARAVIEW_BUILD_QT_GUI OFF). Building and packaging works correctly,
but the resultant tarball (built via cpack -G TGZ --config
{ParaViewBuildDir}/Servers/Executables/CPackParaViewServersConfig.cmake)
contains only lib and bin directories; there is no include directory,
nor a ParaViewConfig.cmake file.

make install seems more promising, as I do end up with a more complete
tree. However, the install fails with the following error:
CMake Error at Documentation/cmake_install.cmake:36 (FILE):
  file INSTALL cannot find
  "/home/ben/3rdpartylibs/paraview/3.7b/unpacked-download-directory/linuxg29x64.26/Documentation/paraview.qch".
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  cmake_install.cmake:95 (INCLUDE)

Can anyone tell what's going wrong?

Thanks,
Ben

Hi,

Thank you Ken for responding.

I suspect that your diagnosis is correct; the root of the problem, I believe, is that I am reading in netCDF data that follows the CF convention.   In particular, the grid is an unstructured triangular 2D grid ('poly data' grid in the venacular of paraview).  The 'dimensions' variables include integer identifiers for triangle nodes, but NOT lat, long, x, y, time etc.  Rather, these are included among the 'variables' variables (e.g. lat = lat(node)).    

Is the problem indeed that the paraview netCDF reader cannot understand this particular netCDF-CF file?  Is there a way around this, without having to change the way the data is outputted (from netCDF-CF to netCDF-COARDS convention)?  Note that I can read into paraview certain variables by filtering out the 1-dimensional variables (lat, long etc.), but of course these variables do not have the correct dependencies (they should be dependent on the variables I filtered out - lat, long etc.)

thanks,
Joel

Hi,

    With the announcement of moving to Git and the upcoming 3.8 release, 
I'd like to pose the following question

    Currently, to build plugins, we need to build Paraview itself

       http://paraview.org/Wiki/Plugin_HowTo

    Are there plans to architect Paraview so that it ships with 
sufficient libraries/headers to enable plugins developer to get to work 
without building the entire Paraview application?

    I think this may encourage more people to contribute to extending 
Paraview.

There are already plans to ship paraview with sufficient
libraries/headers starting the upcoming ParaView 3.8. Separate
downloads will be available from the ParaView website for those who
want the development version of the binaries.

also  if I run the script more than once, the TIME_STEPS variable keep

Subject: [Paraview] Accessing mappers from within Paraview
Message-ID: <4BBC69A3.4040507@rwth-aachen.de>

Hi!

I just wrote a nice mapper which writes some data to the disk, taking a 
volume as input. I thought I could access it from the "Filters" menu, 
but this wasn't possible. In future, this mapper should be called from 
the python shell, but there, it isn't known either:

> >> help(MeasureObjects)

Traceback (most recent call last):

File "<console>", line 1, in <module>

NameError: name 'MeasureObjects' is not defined


The plugin-manager however says, that he loaded my plugin ("...is 
definetely a paraview plugin..."). It shows up as "loaded" when 
verifying this.

The plugin is not intended as a writer or something like that, it just 
looks at the input and writes something to the disk which Paraview 
couldn't use for anything anyway. Here is my xml content:

<ServerManagerConfiguration>
  <!-- This is the server manager configuration XML. It defines the 
interface to
       our new filter. As a rule of thumb, try to locate the 
configuration for
       a filter already in ParaView (in

       that matches your filter and then model your xml on it -->

           </DataTypeDomain>
      </InputProperty>
   <!-- End MeasureObjects -->
   </SourceProxy>
 </ProxyGroup>
</ServerManagerConfiguration>


If I define the plugin as a filter then Paraview complains about not 
having an output port.

Any suggestions?

Subject: [Paraview] pvbatch offscreen rendering problems
Message-ID: <4BBC755C.9060303@arl.army.mil>

Good Morning,

I am currently having issues with paraview-3.8.0 and paraview-3.9.0 when 
trying to use pvbatch and offscreen rendering. When I run with my 
DISPLAY variable set, I don't have any issues, when the DISPLAY variable 
is not set it fails with the "cannot connect to X server error". I have 
built paraview with the following flags to support the offscreen 
rendering capabilities:

OPENGL_INCLUDE_DIR
OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY
OPENGL_glu_LIBRARY
OPENGL_xmesa_INCLUDE_DIR
OSMESA_INCLUDE_DIR
OSMESA_LIBRARY
VTK_OPENGL_HAS_OSMESA=ON
VTK_USE_OFFSCREEN=ON
VTK_USE_DISPLAY=OFF

I have built paraview-3.6.2 with these flags and the pvbatch offscreen 
rendering works perfectly without the DISPLAY variable being set, the 
same does not work for 3.8.0 and 3.9.0. Am I missing a new flag for 
these packages? The mesa version I am using is 7.0.4.

The pvbatch command I am running is:
mpirun -np 4 pvbatch --use-offscreen-rendering testParallelRender.py

Thanks in advance for your help,
Carrie

Hi Ben,

You need to turn on PARAVIEW_INSTALL_DEVELOPMENT to get the include
directories. Is that the case? The ParaViewConfig.cmake file "should" be in
the lib/paraview-x.x/ directory. I will try testing this out. The install
rule for paraview.qch needs logic to disable it when there is no gui. I'll
fix that right now.

Thanks for your feedback!

Christian,

Any reason why you are not making it a writer? To me it doesn't seem
anything different than that except looks like you are not explicitly
specifying the filename (is it hard coded?).

Hi Ben,

If you do an update it shouldn't attempt to install the qch file. Also so
you know, the ParaViewConfig.cmake file doesn't get installed if
PARAVIEW_INSTALL_DEVELOPMENT is turned off.

Let me know if you have anymore issues. Thanks!

Subject: [Paraview] trouble reading in netCDF file
In-Reply-To: <EC6501D4A6BB5442B583E3FABC9D131F1957A2C6@exchange.ad.acadiau.ca>
Message-ID: <C7E1EE47.14373%kmorel@sandia.gov>

The netCDF reader in version understands the COARDS convention (a common subset of CF).  It sounds like the variable annotation you describe should be supported.  However, one major limitation of the netCDF reader is that it only supports reading variables of the same dimensions because it puts them all on the same grid.  So if you have selected to load variables with different dimensions, it will use the dimensions of the first variable and fail to load the rest.  That would explain the behavior you are getting since most netCDF files I have run into seem to have variables with low dimension listed first. (There is no particular reason for this.  It just seems to be what people/applications do.) If this is the case, you are probably also getting a lot of warnings from the netCDF reader about it and the Information panel will be missing many of your variables.  Try turning off all variables in the Object Inspector and turning on only one variable you are interested in.

If this is the problem, it should go away in version 3.8.  Realizing this the 3.6 interface to the netCDF reader really sucks, I changed it to select dimensions instead of variables.  All variables conforming to the selected dimensions are loaded.  It makes using the netCDF reader much easier and problems like the one I described go away.  I also expanded the reader to understand most of the CF convention.

Unfortunately, don't use the CVS for this just yet.  I have recently discovered that a new netCDF reader that was apparently built for a specific use case but seems to screw up on most data was added to ParaView and it is overriding the existing netCDF reader.  We are trying to work on a resolution.

Hi,

Thank you Ken for responding.

I suspect that your diagnosis is correct; the root of the problem, I believe, is that I am reading in netCDF data that follows the CF convention.   In particular, the grid is an unstructured triangular 2D grid ('poly data' grid in the venacular of paraview).  The 'dimensions' variables include integer identifiers for triangle nodes, but NOT lat, long, x, y, time etc.  Rather, these are included among the 'variables' variables (e.g. lat = lat(node)).

Is the problem indeed that the paraview netCDF reader cannot understand this particular netCDF-CF file?  Is there a way around this, without having to change the way the data is outputted (from netCDF-CF to netCDF-COARDS convention)?  Note that I can read into paraview certain variables by filtering out the 1-dimensional variables (lat, long etc.), but of course these variables do not have the correct dependencies (they should be dependent on the variables I filtered out - lat, long etc.)

thanks,
Joel

It sounds like you are reading in an array with 0 or 1 dimensions (not including time).  Although the reader should happily create an image data of that structure, the standard rendering views only understand image data of 2 or 3 dimensions.  Hence you get the error.

If you want to see the data in a plot, try adding the "Plot Data" filter.

Hi,

I am trying to read in a netCDF file using Paraview 3.6.2.  It can 'see' the netCDF file, but when I attempt to read in the file by pressing 'Apply', I get the following error message:

ERROR: In /home/kitware/ParaView3/Utilities/BuildScripts/ParaView-3.6/ParaView3/Servers/Filters/vtkTexturePainter.cxx, line 280
vtkTexturePainter (0xb8a0000): Incorrect dimensionality.

I'm not sure which netCDF release created the netCDF file.  However, I read in a previous post that paraview 3.6.1 could handle netCDF 4, and since  "all netCDF files ever written can always be read by the latest netCDF release. That is, we guarantee backward data compatibility" then 3.6.2 should be able to handle my netCDF file (which wasn't created too recently).

I can read the netCDF file into MATLAB, so it isn't corrupt.

So what's the problem?

thanks
Joel

Hi!

Thanks for the quick reply. I made it a writer and I am now able to 
access the plugin in Python. That's great, but somehow it doesn't 
execute. I can now set the FileName (which I forgot to mention in the 
xml), but I can't get it executed. The plugin is derived from 
vtkImageAlgorithm, but the RequestData method does not seem to be 
called. How do I trigger it?

Best regards,
Christian

You did change your proxy to be a "WriterProxy" or subclass instead of
"SourceProxy" right?

Hi,

I want to read cell data tuples in pvpython, but somehow I am stuck. My data 
is read from an ensight case file and I can process it until that point when 
I need to access the single tuples of my cell data arrays. Please find an 
extract of my pvpython-code below. Does anyone know how to solve that 
problem? Thanks in advance for your efforts.

Carrie,

I just tried it with CVS ParaView and I could not reproduce it. Can
you reproduce this when running on a single node? Try running ldd on
pvbatch, is it getting the right OpenGL libraries?

I am sorry, but it seems that I have a general misunderstanding in how 
to implement a writer. I actually took vtkImageWriter as a guide to 
writing some filter that takes an image as input and writes something to 
the disk. Everything seems fine, but I can't test any further since the 
RequestData method isn't called at all when I use the filter in the 
Python Shell (I cannot acces it anywhere else by the way). I attached my 
xml files.

When using imaging filters in Python you would write something like 
this, after loading a volume:

smooth = GaussianSmooth3D()
Show()

With my writer, I am trying
writer = MeasureObjects()
Show/Update//Execute/GoGoGo/Write/Save/DoSomething/ ...

Nothing happens. No call to RequestData, which has a vtkErrorMacro just 
in the beginning that would show me that it was called.


Best regards,
Christian

Hi Andreas:

    Have you tried visualizing the EnSight data using ParaView UI (instead
of python script)? If it is due to the EnSight reader, please let me know.

You need to call Fetch to bring the real data from the server (even if
it is the builtin server) to the client. Fetch returns a
vtkDataObject, which you can query to get the actual array values out
of.

Utkarsh,

When I do an ldd pvbatch appears to be using the correct libraries GL 
libraries (I am building agains mesa-7.0.4, could it be that my version 
of mesa is too old). I ran the following test:

bash-3.2$ echo $DISPLAY
:0.0
bash-3.2$ unset DISPLAY
bash-3.2$ echo $DISPLAY

bash-3.2$ mpirun -np 4 pvbatch --use-offscreen-rendering 
testParallelRender.py
: cannot connect to X server
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
mpirun has exited due to process rank 0 with PID 4770 on
node ls08270-l.arl.army.mil exiting without calling "finalize". This may
have caused other processes in the application to be
terminated by signals sent by mpirun (as reported here).

When I have DISPLAY set it works perfectly.

Thanks,

That's exactly what I am doing as well ("unset DISPLAY"  that is), and
seems to work well. Is this a debug build. Can you track down where
the error message is coming from? I am not sure where this error
message is coming from since it doesn't look like a paraview message
and a quick "grep" didn't yield any result. When paraview spews a
display error, it looks something as follows:

Process id: 0 >> ERROR: In
/home/utkarsh/Kitware/ParaView3/ParaView3/VTK/Rendering/vtkXOpenGLRenderWindow.cxx,
line 542
vtkXOpenGLRenderWindow (0x3be47e0): bad X server connection.
DISPLAY=Process id: 0 >> ERROR: In
/home/utkarsh/Kitware/ParaView3/ParaView3/VTK/Rendering/vtkXOpenGLRenderWindow.cxx,
line 344
vtkXOpenGLRenderWindow (0x3be47e0): bad X server connection. DISPLAY=p0_29057:

Also make sure that OSMESA_INCLUDE_DIR, and OSMESA_LIBRARY are set
correctly. Just for consistency sake, set the following to default
values:
VTK_USE_OFFSCREEN=OFF
VTK_USE_DISPLAY=ON

These need not be changed at all for using OS mesa in ParaView.

So, we're really stumped.

- Paraview (pvbatch) 3.6.2 works exactly as we'd expect.
- pvbatch 3.8.0/3.9.0 fail with the "can't open display" error.  If we 
set a display variable, pvbatch works, but that's not really a solution.
- All three are using the same exact Mesa library and use the same 
CMakeInit file during the build.  
- We've also built by hand (without a CMakeInit file) and get the same 
error.
- See the same display error when running pvbatch serially

Not really sure where to turn.

I was writing a response when it struck me, are you building with
PARAVIEW_BUILD_QT_GUI ON? That's possible the only difference between
your build and mine. I am going to turn on PARAVIEW_BUILD_QT_GUI and
try to reproduce the problem.

My paraview is still building and will be a while before I can try

Dave,
I'm updating now, and I'll let you know how it goes.

A related question is how to build the dev tree on Windows. How do I
get both debug and release versions of the libraries into one package?
Or is it safe to just include the release version?

Thanks,
Ben

Note: I didn't mean to take this discussion off-list, sorry.

I don't think you can do both. Specifying -C <Release/Debug> tells cpack
which directory to grab everything out of. Also if you do Debug I don't
believe there are install rules to grab the .pdb symbol files. Though, that
probably wouldn't be hard to do.

Thanks. I don't care about the pdb files for now. I just want linking
and running to work for them when they build debug versions of our
app. I guess I'll just tell them to try linking against the release
build I'm providing, and if it fails, they'll have to build ParaView
themselves.

What are you guys planning on shipping for 3.8? Just the release libraries?

Yes the development install packages we provide will be release.

I'm guessing the answer is no (and I couldn't find anything online), but I'll ask anyway - is it possible to export/generate a Python script from a ParaView session/state?

thanks, Randy

Yes, it is possible.  You'll want to use the python trace functionality.
When you're ready to save the state, open the python console, switch to the
trace tab, and click 'Trace State'.  Then click 'Save Trace'.

Here are some more details- http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/Python_GUI_Tools

Thanks Pat.  But I'm not seeing 'Trace State' there - just Start/Stop/Show/Edit/Save Trace.  I'm using 3.6.2 (binary).

Ah, the trace state feature was added just after 3.6.2.

Since trace is implemented completely in python, it is possible to grab
smtrace.py and smstate.py from paraview's cvshead, and then run it from the
python console:

import paraview.smstate as st
st.run()
st.smtrace.save_trace("output.py")

It's possible some other python api changed that will prevent this from
working, but if you can't wait for the 3.8 release, it might be worth giving
a shot.

But the latest binaries found on the download page are those of the PV

Richard,

We are currently working on the binaries. We'll be sending
announcements to the mailing list as the release candidates and the
final release is built.

The ParaView 3.8 branch was created April 5th. The Release announcement is
probably a little premature :-p. Though you can checkout the 3.8 branch and
build it yourself.  I hope to have ParaView 3.8 release candidate binaries
available for download by Friday/Monday and then final binaries shortly
after.

Look like an OpenGL issue. Are you OpenGL drivers setup correctly?

Hi All,

I am very new to CUBE data format. If I have a standard gaussian cube file
which contains information of lattices, position of atoms and a
spin-density. How can I plot iso surfaces at density value =0.008 and
-0.008?

Thank you,

You can load the cube file, apply, select gridded data in the pipeline
browser, then go to filters, common, contour and specify the value ranges in
the properties isosurfaces pane. Then click apply and you will see the
isosurfaces. You can also glyph the Output in the pipeline browser to see
the atoms.

I hope this gets you started - there is lots more that you can do in
ParaView with the data.

Message-ID: <024684DA-47EB-4053-9CA2-3E084F3C75D8@indiana.edu>

I have some questions related to a specific datafile format (simple example below).

Q1:  what exactly is displayed by default when this file is opened?
Q2:  I can't seem to use a Contour filter on the data - is the format of the file causing problems or something else?
Q3:  how does one force output results to go to an existing window, rather than opening a new one?

Here's a link with the same questions and some accompanying pics:

Hi Marcus,

Great!! Awesome.  This is probably the most effortless visualization that I
have created for my user base. I was getting ready to write a loader for it
when I was approached with a CUBE data format.

You mentioned I can do a lot more with ParaView, is there like a manual to
help guide me through? other than bugging you for it?

Thanks,
Simon

For the color map question you asked inside your link, maybe you could
double check the colormap you created.  Paraview's colormap editor can be a
bit touchy, and it's easy to accidentally add extra points.  When I tried
your example data, it correctly colored the point with scalar value 1 using
the default color map.

Try running clean-to-grid filter before you run the contour filter.  Clean
to grid will convert the image data to unstructured grid data.  The contour
filter will work after that.  Maybe someone else can tell you why it doesn't
work without conversion.

Paraview is being clever, and displaying your data by default in a "2D
View."  The output of the contour filter is displayed in the 3D view, so
that's why a new view pops open.  After you open your data, you can
right-click the area above the render view and choose "Covert To" in the
context menu to convert the 2D view to a 3D view.

Message-ID: <i2mc4a1f7841004081728j589636bar467d281caba2e188@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I have an app that is dependent on ParaView, so I need to install the
ParaView libraries along with my application. I am, of course, using
CMake and CPack. Is there an easy way to do this, or do I need to call
install() for each of the libraries my app depends on?

Thanks,

There are ways to include ParaView libraries in your package. Take a
look at the following Wiki page for details:

hi,

When I use the Function keyword to select just a subset of an array  
Paraview cashes without warning.

if I put    Function="$0[1:11]"  in the xdmf file Paraview dies.

What I'm doing wrong?

(see attached file)

Subject: [Paraview] Some information about extending paraview functionalities
Message-ID: <1270809174.22597.19.camel@greenstar>

Hi everybody, 
	Maybe some of my question could be answered with some 'googling', but i
would like to make the point on some problems i have encountered. Thanks
to everybody!

this is my problem:

In the last months i learned the basis of the vtk library (that is
simply a wonderful tool!!) and i am using the python wrappings for my
applications. I have writed a python module with several functions for
doing operations on point clouds.

At this point i am using paraview ONLY for view the results of my python
code...

Now i would like to make a step forward, and begin to implement my code
into the paraview gui, maybe as a filter or plugin (sorry, but i did not
clearly understand the difference!?), so i could import my data in
paraview and do the same operations i am currently doing from the python
shell. It would be great if i could extend paraview-gui functionalities
for setting the parameters and execute the functions i writed in
python...

So i found this page:
http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/Plugin_HowTo#Embedding_Python_Source_as_Modules

but i cannot understand if what i want to do is actually possible or
not..

Anybody can give me some clarifications?
If it is possible, is there a place where to find some examples?

Sorry for my english, i hope you understand what i mean!

Thank you!

Looks like the segfault is coming from the Xdmf library itself in
XdmfDataItem::UpdateFunction. The Xdmf folks may want to take a look
at it.

Pat,

Thanks for the tips.  Sure enough, the clean-to-grid filter worked (seems odd though, as the contour filter would presumably use a slower alg on an unstruct grid).

Regarding the "Convert to" 2D/3D views, when I tried it on that example, it seemed to clear the views and I wasn't sure how to recover them.  But I'll keep playing.

Paraview's colormap editor can be a bit touchy, and it's easy to accidentally add extra points.  When I tried your example data, it correctly colored the point with scalar value 1 using the default color map.

After you open your data, you can right-click the area above the render view and choose "Covert To" in the context menu to convert the 2D view to a 3D view.

It may just be the visibility?  Take a look at the eyeball icons next to the
objects in the pipeline browser.

Yep.  Duh.  Sorry for the noise.

Hi Simon,

I think that http://www.paraview.org/paraview/help/documentation.htmlcontains
links to all of the available resources for ParaView. Depending on
what you are doing with ParaView the user's guide (book), wiki, or Doxygen
generated API documentation are all great resources.

There are also training courses, support and consulting with Kitware and
this mailing list. The Source can also provide great updates to new features
in ParaView, and other Kitware projects/products.

Message-ID: <2166AA0B-D110-4915-813B-001F1EC098AD@bluequartz.net>

Checkout/updated from CVS this afternoon and a fresh configure and  
compile I get the following error on OS X 10.5.8:

[ 23%] Generating vtkSocketCommunicatorHash.h
dyld: Library not loaded: libvtksys.pv3.8.dylib
   Referenced from: /Users/Shared/Kitware-CVS/ParaView3/Build/VTK/

make[1]: *** [VTK/Parallel/CMakeFiles/vtkParallel.dir/all] Error 2

The issue is that the libraries do not have a full install_name on  
them which forces me to remember to "export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=`pwd`/ 
bin" from the build folder. Can this be added to the CMake custom  
command for OS X? I seem to hit this error every time I do a fresh  
configure.

Hey Mike,

Are you configuring here with VTK_USE_RPATH = OFF? This is what happens to me, too, if I don't turn it ON.

Thanks,

I haven't had time to track down a good fix for this besides setting my
DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH but If you have a fix then I will gladly commit it!

Somewhere RPATH is getting turned off as after checking with CMake-GUI

Would something like:

if (VTK_RPATH == OFF && APPLE == TRUE)
set ($ENV{DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH} ${CMAKE_RUNTIME_PATH})
endif()

I'm going to guess that might have some side effects but not really  
sure what those might be.

Where is the CMAKE_CUSTOM_COMMAND located in the ParaView cmake files.  
I'll give it a shot and see what happens.

VTK\Parallel\CMakeLists.txt Line 242.

# Generate "vtkSocketCommunicatorHash.h".
ADD_CUSTOM_COMMAND(
  OUTPUT ${VTK_BINARY_DIR}/Parallel/vtkSocketCommunicatorHash.h
  DEPENDS ${VTK_SOURCE_DIR}/Parallel/vtkSocketCommunicator.cxx
          vtkHashSource
  COMMAND vtkHashSource
    ${VTK_SOURCE_DIR}/Parallel/vtkSocketCommunicator.cxx
    vtkSocketCommunicatorHash vtkSocketCommunicatorHash.h
  )

But setting the ENV at configure time won't help. Probably that command
should be cmake -P <small_script> that does set the environment and then
execute_process vtkHashSource.

Hi,

Is there any way to get the local process id from within a python script?  I
can't seem to get hold of vtkMultiProcessController and can't find any other
way through the modules...

Thanks,
Nathan.

Subject: [Paraview] Python scripts with PyQt4
Message-ID: <2303C306-E0F5-468B-A33D-CD7BB22E8412@stefan-kroboth.com>

Hello!

I've build a Gui in the QtDesigner and converted it into a *.py file using pyuic4. Then I wrote a small program which loads and shows this Window. This program works fine in Python 2.6 but fails in the ParaView python shell. Since I'm new to Qt I don't know where to look for help. Is it even possible to display custom Windows? 
This is the code I tried (based on a tutorial):

import sys
from paraview.simple import *
from PyQt4 import QtCore, QtGui
from MITgui import Ui_MIT_Automator

class Qt_MIT_Gui(QtGui.QMainWindow):   
    def __init__(self, parent=None):
    QtGui.QWidget.__init__(self, parent)
    self.ui = Ui_MIT_Automator()
    self.ui.setupUi(self)


if __name__ == "__main__":  
    bla = QtGui.QApplication(sys.argv)
    test = Qt_MIT_Gui()
    test.show()
    sys.exit(test.exec_())

1. The first problem is sys.argv. I solve that by assigning ["path to the script"] to it.
2. When 1. is solved, it gets stuck in the line "bla = QtGui.QApplication(sys.argv)". When I comment that line, it ...
3. ... gets to "QtGui.QWidget.__init__(self, parent)", where it gets stuck again. ParaView just doesn't do anything and has to be killed.

I tried a lot of things, which were mostly just random alterations (because of my lack of knowledge). 
It would be very nice if someone could provide me a minimal example of how to load and display a Qt gui (if this is even possible).

Please excuse once again my bad englisch :)

Thanks,
   Stefan

Hi, just thought I'd share this in case someone else runs into the same
issue-

After upgrading my computer to dual quad-core intel xeons, and installing
Ubuntu Karmic (9.10), pvserver with mpi would hang after a few renders.  It
turns out it was this bug:

https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openmpi/+bug/504659
https://svn.open-mpi.org/trac/ompi/ticket/2043

I removed the openmpi-bin and libopenmpi-dev packages and installed
libmpich2-dev and mpich2.  Now everything is stable!

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview crashes when loading simple Plugin
Message-ID: <4BC06D3B.60208@rwth-aachen.de>

Hi!

I don't like it, but I have to get some plugins running with Paraview in 
Windohs. I just installed 3.8 RC1 for that purpose. At first, everything 
seemed fine. Two of my filters that worked in Linux worked right out of 
the box, after compiling them with Visual Studio Express. But a third 
one wouldn't. I chose to set the environment variable PV_PLUGIN_DEBUG to 
see if I can detect what goes wrong. It turned out that Paraview gets 
unstable in this mode, i.e. it doesn't load any simple Plugin anymore, 
it just crashes when trying.

I have attached a CMakeList and two xmls that define a new Paraview 
plugin. It is an already existing vtk filter. Paraview crashes when I 
try to load it, only if the pv_plugin_debug variable is set. Without the 
debugging variable, the filter loads and works just fine.

What shall I do?

I cloned the github repository and it compiled successfully.

However, when I try to run it, I get:

Anyone know how to fix this?

Try recompiling your plugin.

Hm, is there a way to figure out which one it is complaining about? Or
remove all the auto loaded plugins so that paraview will start and
then I can re-load them one at a time?

Thanks,

Take a look at

The debug info printed lists which file ParaView was trying to load.

Any chance there are other versions on ParaView in your PATH? Try
using dependency walker to ensure that the correct dlls are being
loaded.

I am absolutely sure that there is no other ParaView Version around. I 
installed everything on a completely "Kitware-Free" Windows 7 System, so 
I just downloaded a stable 2.8 CMake and the RC Paraview (and QT 4.6.2) 
and then compiled everything with Visual Studio Express 8. QT was 
precompiled for VS though. Paraview even crashes when I try to load one 
of the prelisted plugins with the pv_plugin_debug turned on.

Subject: [Paraview] ProxyProperty and homonyms
Message-ID: <w2me7f43c4f1004111313hc6349fcydcf470b8b206aee1@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

One of my filters has a member that is a vtkPolyDataAlgorithm. The user has
to set it to a specific smoothing filter, eg. vtkPolyDataSmoothingFilter.
The member is called "RegularizationFilter" in my VTK class. Thus the
ServerManager XML contains the following property:

        <ProxyProperty name="RegularizationFilter"
                       command="SetRegularizationFilter">
           <ProxyListDomain name="proxy_list">
              <Proxy group="filters" name="SmoothPolyDataFilter"/>
           </ProxyListDomain>
        </ProxyProperty>

In ParaView, I can get the filter working, with a combobox proposing the
Smooth filter and its properties in a frame below. Problem is that Smooth
has a "NumberOfIterations" property, and my filter has too! When I change
the NumberOfIterations in the smooth filter, the homonym changes as well...

How can I set both NumberOfIterations independent? Thanks for your
suggestions!

Please find attached the XML describing my filter.

Best regards,
Jerome

Subject: [Paraview] Some information about extending paraview
 functionalities
In-Reply-To: <1270809174.22597.19.camel@greenstar>
Message-ID: <C7E89191.145BD%kmorel@sandia.gov>

Difference between filters and plugins:  Filters are the computational units in VTK and ParaView.  They are connected together to form pipelines.  In ParaView, the available filters are listed in the Filters menu.  Plugins are a mechanism to add functionality to ParaView.  That often includes adding filters to the Fitlers menu, but could also include a number of other things such as new menus, views, or python scripts.

In ParaView there are actually two distinct versions of Python scripting which I usually labels as client-side scripting and server-side scripting.  Client-side scripting is used to automate the operations that you would typically do through the ParaView GUI.  It does not really interface directly with the VTK Python wrappings that you use.  Client-side scripting is described on this Wiki page: http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Python_Scripting

Server-side scripting is run directly in the pipeline via the Programmable Filter.  To use it, you basically create a Programmable Filter and throw your Python code inside it.  In this form of scripting you are directly interfacing with the VTK Python wrappers.  Server-side scripting is described on this Wiki page: http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Python_Programmable_Filter

The plugin page concerning embedding Python that you pointed to is a convenience for plugins that provide or use client-side scripts.  It is not useful for server-side scripting because that Python code does not have access to the loaded modules.  (Or at least, I don't think that they do.)

Hi everybody,
        Maybe some of my question could be answered with some 'googling', but i
would like to make the point on some problems i have encountered. Thanks
to everybody!

this is my problem:

In the last months i learned the basis of the vtk library (that is
simply a wonderful tool!!) and i am using the python wrappings for my
applications. I have writed a python module with several functions for
doing operations on point clouds.

At this point i am using paraview ONLY for view the results of my python
code...

Now i would like to make a step forward, and begin to implement my code
into the paraview gui, maybe as a filter or plugin (sorry, but i did not
clearly understand the difference!?), so i could import my data in
paraview and do the same operations i am currently doing from the python
shell. It would be great if i could extend paraview-gui functionalities
for setting the parameters and execute the functions i writed in
python...

So i found this page:
http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/Plugin_HowTo#Embedding_Python_Source_as_Modules

but i cannot understand if what i want to do is actually possible or
not..

Anybody can give me some clarifications?
If it is possible, is there a place where to find some examples?

Sorry for my english, i hope you understand what i mean!

Thank you!

Hi all,
   I'd like to use Paraview to make both 2D and 3D plots. I'm not sure
what is the best way for doing 2D plots: is it by treating them as 3D
plots with the third coordinate set to 0?

If possible, I would prefer using .vtk ASCII input files, and my data
are given on an unstructured triangular grid.

Thank you,
   Marco

You can work around this bug by increasing the number of fifos open mpi
uses. This avoids the race condition where all the fifos seem to be in
use. Add :

-mca btl_sm_num_fifos 16

to the mpirun command line.

Message-ID: <D05D4B7D92946E468CA98F578A0D739F0203F4E5F9@v-rot-exch01.scion.local>

I am developing a python script to visualise point data (unstructured grid) with a large number of scalar values for each point.
My problem is some of the scalar data is a bit noisy, i.e. a histogram of the values has a long tail at one or both ends, which effectively reduces the useful range of color in the visualisation. I would like to determine the 5 and 95 percentiles for each data array and use these as the range for the LUT. And I would like to do this from my python script. I can't figure out how to get at the underlying point data, as it would then be very easily to calculate a restricted range.
See my current script below.

Thanks in advance for any help, Dave

I found this thread, really interesting:
   http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2008-December/010414.html

In my case, do I have to use SubProxy and play with ExposedProperties,
ShareProperties and Except rather than propxyProperty?

Or maybe there as similar mechanism (Exposed, except,...) in ProxyProperty?

Best regards,
Jerome

Is there a way to display all the options for my standard reader here? At
the moment the object inspector is empty for my file series reader.

Thanks in advance,

In vtkSMProxyProperty::ReadXMLAttributes() (and it's parent classes),
I do not see any attribute similar to Exposed or Shared in the XML
parser.

You might be able to work around it by making new proxies for
SmoothPolyDataFilter, and then changing the name of the property in
your version.

Subject: [Paraview] Calculator performing poorly in ParaView-3-8 branch
Message-ID: <x2mcf8ff04e1004131223zdc39a4b9k9b57558b23c6f375@mail.gmail.com>

I've noticed the calculator has started performing substantially
slower in the ParaView-3-8 branch when taking the magnitude of a
vector as compared to the Head before the branch.
I've attached a graph summarizing the performance degradation.  I used
the Mandelbrot source and took the magnitude of the coords vector to
collect data for the graph.
One of my machines averages nearly a 6x slowdown and the other a 4.5x slowdown.

The *-march is a Head build  from 3/23/2010.
3-8 is the branch as of yesterday afternoon.

I (believe) the change that affected the calculator performance
happened after the branch as I noticed it after I updated the branch (
I wouldn't bet too much on this though)...  I don't know if the Head
is affected.

Thanks,
--John Patchett.

John,

Attached is a patch. Can you verify that it overcomes the performance
issues you are seeing? If so, I'll commit it to CVS and get in 3.8
branch as well.

Message-ID: <D6860797-2DB5-4C17-994D-60BB3D54A522@cs.duke.edu>

Hello folks,

I'm having trouble building today's CVS when I turn PARAVIEW_GENERATE_PROXY_DOCUMENTATION: ON (It builds fine when I turn it off). I get this same error repeated for Sources, Filters, Readers & Writers:

[ 99%] Creating Documentation for ParaViewSources

Looks like my system doesn't like something about the new ExecuteSMExtractDocumentation.cmake... (Mac OS X 10.6.3, serial Release Cocoa build, x86_64 arch, CMake 2.9.20100113, Qt 4.6.2)

Thanks,

Is it possible to open two windows, and have one view of my dataset not animate, but have the second view of the same dataset  animate?  Is it possible to have the first only animate half way then stop, while the second continues to animate?  This would be for saving animations.

Thanks,

Hi Alan,

Currently, you can use the temporal shift-scale filter to have a linear 
time transform between two filters, or use the TimeKeeper keyframe editor 
in the animation view to have a complex evolution of the global time.
I found that for complex time evolutions, this is not enough, so I have a 
plugin that allows you to force the time for a given filter, this would 
allow you to have two completely independent times on the same animation.
Give me a few days to clean it up and commit.

Hi all,
I'm trying to read a large data set ~60Milion cells in Ensight format. The
files on the disk are about 18GBs.

I compiled Paraview with mpich, I run 8 pvserver on my workstation with
mpirun. My workstation has _144GB of RAM_ (which should be enough to load
the entire data set), with two quad core.

When I try to load the data set I always get the error reported below. I
monitored the situation and when this happen my workstation RAM usage is
only ~ 26%.


Thank you for your help,
Luca

You are right! I thought that the "command" field was guilty (they are the
homonyms), but they were not. I simply changed the property name in my new
filter, so that I don't have to rewrite XML for existing proxies.

Thanks a lot David!

Luca,

It seems you are using pv 3.6.2, could you try with paraview cvs or wait a 
few days and try it with the 3.8 version?
This kind of issue should be fixed now.

For both cases you can use the Temporal Shift Scale filter, showing
the original data in one view and the temporal shift scale filter in
another. Once you have added the temporal shift scale filter, right
click on the filter in the pipeline browser and check "Ignore Time",
then right click on the data source and uncheck "Ignore Time".  When
"Ignore Time" is check, the timesteps produced by that filter and not
considered by the application for deciding the range/timesteps for the
default animaiton.

Hi Alan,

Currently, you can use the temporal shift-scale filter to have a linear time transform between two filters, or use the TimeKeeper keyframe editor in the animation view to have a complex evolution of the global time.
I found that for complex time evolutions, this is not enough, so I have a plugin that allows you to force the time for a given filter, this would allow you to have two completely independent times on the same animation.
Give me a few days to clean it up and commit.

Is it possible to open two windows, and have one view of my dataset not animate, but have the second view of the same dataset  animate?  Is it possible to have the first only animate half way then stop, while the second continues to animate?  This would be for saving animations.

Thanks,

Hi Utkarsh and Stephane,
In another setting, I have two time series data sets. The time sequences 
are totally independent with each other. Each time sequence can have 
irregular spacing as well (due to the fact of relativistic time-space 
model). How can I view both data sets in the same window/view with 
consistent time stamp for both of them.

The first frame of one data set appears in the middle of the other data 
sequence. I currently use temporal interpolater with the delta time 
interval the value of the common denominator of both data set time 
sequences. However, both data sets appears from the very beginning.

Thanks for your help.

Best,
xunlei

Hi,

I'm trying to read a "home made" xdmf file into paraview but, a get  
the following error:

Warning: In /Users/partyd/Kitware/ParaView-3.6/ParaView3/VTK/Filtering/ 
vtkDataSet.cxx, line 447
vtkUnstructuredGrid (0x1fa64d80): Cell array Eps2 with 1 components,  
has 11376 tuples but there are only 1896 cells

Tensor6 implies a value with 6 components ???
Why paraview thinks that Tensor6 is a 1 components  field???

Unless I misunderstand your first question, you should be able to make the time series of the two data sets consistent using the temporal shift scale filter.

There is no direct way to get a data set to not load during a certain time, but you can fake it by toggling the visibility.  Open the Animation View (View -> Animation View) and add a track for your the visibility of your data.  Make the visibility zero when the data is invalid, one otherwise.

You need to add an ExposedProperties tag under the SubProxy tag in the FileSeriesReaderProxy.  In the ExposedProperties tag, list all properties you want to show up in the object inspector.  See XMLPolyDataReader in Servers/ServerManager/Resources/readers.xml for an example.

Another solution that my user wants is to be able to control two different cameras at the same time.  For instance, my user wants to watch a car crash.  In one window, they want to look at the crash site.  A second window should follow the right car, and in a third window they want to follow the left car.

Can this be done with ParaView?

Hey Dave,

If you want to retrieve the attribute data to make the calculations then you can call

servermanager.Fetch()

to pull from the server to the client. You can see examples on:

http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/ParaView/Python_Scripting

If your data is very large, though, it might be tough to do this. If you look at the above page it talks about passing algorithms as the optional arguments, like vtkMinMax, which will process the data on the server and send a result to the client. I'm not sure all of what would be involved (probably making a plugin that you can load with your custom class), but you may be able to make a quantile filter in place of vtkMinMax and pass that to Fetch(). 

Another thing I've done is to use a Python Programmable Filter (PPF) to do something similar to what vtkMinMax is doing: Calculate statistics on my data set and output a single point which has the calculated attributes (such as mean of all input attributes). Maybe you could just output a two-point polydata from your PPF in which each point contains the 5 and 95 percentiles for every attribute, and then Fetch that data to set the LUT ranges?

Hope this helps,
-Eric

I would like to determine the 5 and 95 percentiles for each data array and use these as the range for the LUT. And I would like to do this from my python script. I can't figure out how to get at the underlying point data, as it would then be very easily to calculate a restricted range.

I am dealing with a set of data with vtu format. There is a variable
changing over time, but somehow its value was stored separately at each time
instance and with different variable names. Say the variable is x, and at
each time instance its value was stored with x_001, x_002,x_003,....x_100.
So now I am wondering how to combine these to a single variable x with time
indices in Paraview. Your input is highly appreciated!

Yes, simply select each view and add animation tracks for the camera.
The animation view allows user to add the camera track for the active
view.

Message-ID: <y2z636847371004150007r6a0762c7ge447dd0961d9b28b@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

When we are doing a parallel volume rendering(using the Wavelet source from
ParaView) and show the result on a tiled display, it seems that the final
image is not composited correctly. We use the Fix Point mapper  in the first
attachment and GPU mapper  in the second attachment. We also render another
dataset(box.ex2 from ParaView Data), but the result is correct. The
correctly composited image is showed in the third attachment. I notice that
the Wavelet source support GPU mapper whereas the box.ex2 does not. Does it
have something to do with that?

I had the same trouble a while ago, (I think) the trouble arises from the Xdmf assuming that a tensor is 9 components and therefore rejects a 6 way tensor and treats it like a scalar. I thought this was fixed at some time, I may be wrong. Either way, look at the Xdmf reader code, scan through for references to tensors and tweak it to say 6 instead of 9 (or whatever), you can make it work for a quick fix.

just a heads up that this morning I committed a change to the CSCS_PointSprite plugin to drop the CSCS prefix.

When you next do an update from CVS, do remember to wipe away any binaries (or intermediate files) with the CSCS Prefix - otherwise you'll start getting odd crashes as the binary plugins get loaded but gradually become less compatible as the code base underneath evolves.

Subject: [Paraview] Rendering failed because... of the OpenGL driver
Message-ID: <56595E9B27ED4949A183736B4949C282@notebook>

All,

I just thought I'd share this slight improvement to the code to help with
debugging why GPU rendering fails. Maybe this can get into the source?

In ParaView3/VTK/VolumeRendering/vtkOpenGLGPUVolumeRayCastMapper.cxx
vtkOpenGLGPUVolumeRayCastMapper::PreRender, I've added extra code to handle
an unsupported driver and report it to the user.

  // If we can't load the necessary extensions, provide
  // feedback on why it failed.
  if(!this->LoadExtensionsSucceeded)
    {
    const char *gl_vendor=reinterpret_cast<const char
*>(glGetString(GL_VENDOR));
    const char *gl_version=reinterpret_cast<const char
*>(glGetString(GL_VERSION));
    vtkErrorMacro(
      "Rendering failed because the following OpenGL extensions "
      "are required but not supported: " <<
      (this->UnsupportedRequiredExtensions->Stream.str()).c_str() <<
      "\n or the " << gl_vendor << " " << gl_version << " OpenGL
implementation is not supported for GPU rendering"
       );
    return;
    }

In 3.9.0 an error was reported about extensions but it did not indicate what
OpenGL driver it found (e.g. Mesa and ATI libraries are not handled). The
new error output looks like the following: 

ERROR: In
/scratch/pmcintos/ParaView3/VTK/VolumeRendering/vtkOpenGLGPUVolumeRayCastMap
per.cxx, line 4207
vtkOpenGLGPUVolumeRayCastMapper (0x18a06460): Rendering failed because the
following OpenGL extensions are required but not supported: 
 or the Mesa Project 1.4 (2.1 Mesa 7.6.1) OpenGL implementation is not
supported for GPU rendering

Hope this helps someone :)

Cheers,

Paul

Hello,

do you know if it is possible to write/read two different unstructured grids on a single .vtu file?
I'm working with B-Spline/NURBS geometry and I would like to have the control net (the first unstructured grid) and the resulting discretized geometry (the second unstructured grid) in a single file...

Thank you very much.

Hey Massimiliano,

Since unstructured grids are so unstructured, you could combine both geometries together as part of the same unstructured grid, but then it's not as easy to manipulate them or color them separately later. 

What you might want to do is to Group your two unstructured grids into a multi-block data set and save it as a .vtm file. Then, at any point where you want to deal with one of the grids separately from the other, you can use Extract Block to pull them apart.

If you already have your two .vtu files and all you're concerned about is being able to load them simultaneously, then you could also refer to them both within a single .pvd file and they would load as a multi-block data set:

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<VTKFile type="Collection" version="0.1" byte_order="LittleEndian">
  <Collection>
    <DataSet group="" part="0" file="elements.vtu"/>
    <DataSet group="" part="1" file="quadraticTetra01.vtu"/>
  </Collection>
</VTKFile>

Talk to you later,
-Eric

Hi Alan,

I commited the ForceTime plugin in CVS.
It is not built by defaut, you have to turn the 
PARAVIEW_BUILD_PLUGIN_ForceTime cmake variable to ON to build it.

Once built and loaded, you will see a new entry in the Filter/Temporal 
menu called "Force Time".
This filter has two properties : 
Ignore Pipeline Time : if unchecked, this filters does nothing, time 
requests are passed through and the second parameter is ignored.
Forced Time : if the above is checked, the time specified here will 
override the time requests in the pipeline.

To use it to create an animation : place it at the end of the pipeline for 
which you want to have a particular time evolution (independent from the 
global one), and add a new animation track where you can animate the 
ForcedTime value as you need.

This plugin as some limitations : as it overrides the VTK time requests, 
it does not work well with time-aware filters such as PathLines and 
PlotOverTime. You should never place it above such a filter in a pipeline.

Is it possible to open two windows, and have one view of my dataset not 
animate, but have the second view of the same dataset  animate?  Is it 
possible to have the first only animate half way then stop, while the 
second continues to animate?  This would be for saving animations.
 
Thanks,

Subject: [Paraview] Python - Accessing Image Data
Message-ID: <4BC721A5.3080905@rwth-aachen.de>

Hi!

Is it actually possible to read and/or manipulate actual image data 
within the Python Shell? I can somehow access field and array data like 
this:

inputVolume=GetActiveSource()
pd=inputVolume.GetPointData
array=pd.GetArray(0)

Then I can do array.sort(), array.reverse() and such. But this has no 
noticable effect and isn't what I want anyway. I also tried GetFieldData 
and GetCellData, but their GetNumberOfArrays() returned 0.

This is just a general question. What I actually need is to read out 
which Points have been selected by the user.

Best regards,
Christian

Wouldn't it have been much easier to simply tweak Temporal shift scale to give it a couple more options? (rather than a complete new plugin)

Hi John,

The main difference between the temporal shift scale and the force time 
filters is that the temporal shift scale modifies the global time request, 
but the force time as no reference to the global time at all.
I could have added a more complex transform to the temporal shift scale, 
but I found it easier to use the animation keyframe editor to setup the 
time evolution.

For your information, the typical use case I had was to make an animation 
were an object was evolving over time, and replicates of this object would 
be made at some specific times to get a "snapshot" effect : see several 
times of the same object on the same image side by side while the original 
continues to evolve. I found it impossible to do with the temporal shift 
scale.

And the force time plugin is actually so simple...

Stephane

Wouldn't it have been much easier to simply tweak Temporal shift scale to 
give it a couple more options? (rather than a complete new plugin)

Steady on! The temporalShiftScale modified the time passed into the local portion of the pipeline - this is not the global time request - it is the time passed upstream. But what I meant was why not just add a checkbox to TemporalShiftScale to "suppress time" and simply 'not' pass it upstream rather than pass a modified time upstream.

Indeed, but as others have posted. A combination of the two can be very powerful. However, if your stuff works for you, all well and good. I'll have a look at it and see if the functionality could be better incorporated into TemporalshiftScale

one option would be enhance TemporalshiftScale with your force option and rename it to TemporalModifier (or similar) to avoid a strict name adherence to functionality

indeed - just telling TemporalShiftScale to freeze at one user selected time value would achieve this. I'll look into it.

This page seems quite out of date:

The first step is to do "File -> Load Texture", which seems to not exist.

Any Paraview texture mapping experts care to update it?

Hi,

I just took a look at the 3.8rc1 version for linux 64bit. Unfortunately, 
I am missing the 'fast' openfoam reader. Is this a 'bug' or do I need to

Greetings Everyone,

We have just made ParaView 3.8.0 Release Candidate 1 binaries available for
download on the ParaView download page. Final binaries and/or more release
candidates should follow shortly after the Git transition occurring next
week.

http://paraview.org/paraview/resources/software.html

The release notes can be found here:

http://www.kitware.com/news/home/browse/Paraview?2010_04_05&ParaView+3.8

One thing to note, there are now two sets of Mac Binaries. An App and Server
Tools compiled as universal binaries that work on Tiger (10.4) or later and
are built with Carbon.  A new addition includes a set of App and Server
Tools compiled 64-bit with Cocoa that work on Leopard (10.5) and higher
only.

Some of the known bugs presently include:

1. Images and portions of the integrated Documentation are missing on some
platforms.
2. Intermittent crashes when closing VisTrails/ParaView after loading the
VisTrails plugin.

Please feel free to try them out and provide any feedback about your
experiences with them.


Enjoy!

This is a bug and I think I know what changed (I see there is a new #ifdef
VTK_USE_OPENFOAM line in the readers.xml that has been mistakenly merged
into the branch). I will make sure these are removed and that the reader is
available in the next set of binaries.

Thanks for catching this!

Hi all,

When we are doing a parallel volume rendering(using the Wavelet source from ParaView) and show the result on a tiled display, it seems that the final image is not composited correctly. We use the Fix Point mapper  in the first attachment and GPU mapper  in the second attachment. We also render another dataset(box.ex2 from ParaView Data), but the result is correct. The correctly composited image is showed in the third attachment. I notice that the Wavelet source support GPU mapper whereas the box.ex2 does not. Does it have something to do with that?

Ning,

Go to the Edit |Settings dialog. On the "Server" page make sure that
the Remote Render Threshold is 0 (and enabled). Volume rendering is
only supported when parallel rendering is enabled.

I added the VTK_USE_OPENFOAM line in the readers.xml and it was necessary, if the user has turned off openfoam, paraview crashed on every load of unknown type.

Subject: [Paraview] Python state trace w/glyphs not working
Message-ID: <DFD71F16-AE28-43B0-9573-0502863A62BA@cs.duke.edu>

Hey all,

I haven't been using the python trace or state trace much lately, but I just noticed a problem that shows up both on the Ubuntu 64-bit 3.8 RC1 binary and CVS PV 3.9 on OS X, so it might be pretty general. If I do:

PointSource: 100 pts, rad 10
Glyph: Sphere (the rest default)

and do a Trace State, the beginning of the trace looks like this:

WARNING: Missing dependencies, could not register proxies: [<paraview.servermanager.Glyph object at 0x12910d490>]
WARNING: Missing dependencies, could not register proxies: [<paraview.servermanager.GeometryRepresentation object at 0x12913ead0>]
try: paraview.simple
except: from paraview.simple import *
Glyph1 = GetActiveSource()
DataRepresentation2 = GetDisplayProperties(Glyph1)
RenderView1 = CreateRenderView()
RenderView1.LightSpecularColor = [1.0, 1.0, 1.0]
[...]

So I can't do a state trace that includes a glyph filter. Sorry I haven't investigated more to see how widespread a problem it is, or if it's only with Glyph.

Thanks,
-Eric

I suppose the bigger question is why do we even have the
VTK_USE_OPENFOAM option? Any reason why anyone would want to disable
it?

Message-ID: <C7ECD147.14850%kmorel@sandia.gov>

ParaView has no direct mechanism to recognize those multiple variables as a time series.  The most straightforward way to do something like that would be to create a filter that reports a time series based on the variables it encounters in RequestInformation and then selects the appropriate variable (with proper name change) in RequestData.

Unless you are already developing C++ plugins, the quickest way to develop such a filter would be to use the Python programmable filter.

Hi,

I am dealing with a set of data with vtu format. There is a variable changing over time, but somehow its value was stored separately at each time instance and with different variable names. Say the variable is x, and at each time instance its value was stored with x_001, x_002,x_003,....x_100. So now I am wondering how to combine these to a single variable x with time indices in Paraview. Your input is highly appreciated!

Hi All,

We are going to be locking the following CVS repositories tomorrow (April
16th) to commence the Git Transition. After the transition is complete, you
will have to patch in any changes you have in your local CVS sandboxes into
a new git clone of any of these repositories.

VTK
VTKData
VTKLargeData
ParaView
ParaViewData
XDMF
IceT

Please read Brad's email (below) for more details regarding Git and also if
you have not provided Kitware with your public ssh key and wish to have push
access please read below.

Thanks!

Sorry for the duplicate email, including the ParaView lists as well,

Hi all,

A bug a user found with the latest ParaView binary led me to discover that
building the OpenFOAM reader is optional. Is there any reason this should
be? If not, does anyone object to me removing the CMake option and just
having it always built?

Thanks!

Yeah, this never worked (well it worked for a while due to a bug, but
stopped working when I fixed the bug....)  It affects filters that have
Input properties with ProxyListDomain.  Stream tracer, probe location are
other examples I can find.  Turns out it was an easy fix, I'll push the
change tomorrow:

Thanks a lot for looking into it and finding a fix so quickly, Pat!

I need to set up some offline animations for some of my users and it's so much easier now that all the python trace stuff is in place -- trace it, add an AnimateReader at the end and then all I have to worry about is data file names. (Well, in practice I do a little clean-up of the trace, but it's so much easier than having to do it from scratch in python -- get to set up the vis in PV and then generate similar animations in batch for other simulation runs. Nice.)

Talk to you later,
-Eric

There is no reason why it should be optional.

Subject: [Paraview] Visibility Animation using Python Batches
Message-ID: <189741AF-6E16-469A-BCC7-165503E9F1E4@uclouvain.be>

Dear all,

Sorry if this question sounds dummy but I'm really new to Paraview and Python. I would like to realize and save an animation that displays tens of sphere sequentially (i.e. the spheres appear one at a time). Since I have a lot of them, I would like to do it using Python commands. However, it does not seem to work at all for me. Here is what I tried:

scene = servermanager.animation.AnimationScene()
scene.ViewModules = [GetActiveView()]
pts = [[15,15,15],[10,10,10],[5,5,5],[0,0,0],[-5,-5,-5],[-10,-10,-10],[-15,-15,-15]]
spheres=[]
cues=[]
ts=1
for i in range(len(pts)):
	# Create the sphere
	spheres.append(Sphere(Center=pts[i], Radius=2,ThetaResolution=5))
	Show(spheres[i])
	r = GetRepresentation()
	r.DiffuseColor=[0.5,0.8,0]
	# Animate
	cues.append(servermanager.animation.KeyFrameAnimationCue())
	cues[i].AnimatedProxy = GetActiveSource()
	cues[i].AnimatedPropertyName = "Visibility"
	keyf0 = servermanager.animation.CompositeKeyFrame()
	keyf0.KeyTime = 0
	keyf0.KeyValues=0
	keyf1 = servermanager.animation.CompositeKeyFrame()
	keyf1.KeyTime=i*ts
	keyf1.KeyValues=1
	cues[i].KeyFrames=[keyf0,keyf1]

scene.Cues = cues
scene.Play()

and I get this error:

ERROR: In /Users/partyd/Dashboards/MyTests/ParaView-3-8-0/ParaView3/Servers/ServerManager/vtkSMBooleanKeyFrameProxy.cxx, line 48
vtkSMBooleanKeyFrameProxy (0x143059ee0): Cue does not have domain or property set!


If there's a simple GUI way to do it, I'd be blessed too of course but I don't want to do it for each point separately. In the example, above, I just set pts to some arbitrary values but in my case I really have tens of points.

Thank you a lot in advance!

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview 3.8 (RC1) -- Feature List?
Message-ID: <4BC7DF32.8080801@web.de>

Hi,

Thanks to all the developers of Paraview. I've just installed the latest 
version 3.8 (RC1), and I can see a few changes a fee changes such as 
fullscreen have been implemented. But I'm not sure what other features 
have been implemented. The fact that we've gone from version 3.6 to 3.8 
suggest that the current release has got a large number of new features. 
It would be nice to have a full feature list (just like Mozilla does 
with Firefox), so that users can know if any long-awaited features have 
been implemented. I for one have been waiting for the native in-situ 
feature. I'd like to have another applications ask Paraview to load a 
new data set as soon as it becomes available. Does Paraview now have 
this feature?

Thanks,

- Olumide

Olumide,

Indeed, the feature list has been posted at:
http://www.kitware.com/news/home/browse/Paraview?2010_04_05&ParaView+3.8

Once we have the final binaries ready, I will post an email on the
mailing list with the (possibly updated) feature list for this
release.

Here is an updated version of your script with inline comments. That
should get you started.

-----------------------
from paraview.simple import *

CreateRenderView()

scene = servermanager.animation.AnimationScene()
scene.ViewModules = [GetActiveView()]
pts = [[15,15,15],[10,10,10],[5,5,5],[0,0,0],[-5,-5,-5],[-10,-10,-10],[-15,-15,-15]]
spheres=[]
cues=[]
# the time for the animation cue are in relation to the StartTime and EndTime
# for the scene which by default is 0.0 and 1.0 respectively, so we scale the
# KeyTime values for key frames accordingly
ts=1.0/len(pts)
for i in range(len(pts)):
       # Create the sphere
       spheres.append(Sphere(Center=pts[i], Radius=2,ThetaResolution=5))
       repr = Show(spheres[i])
       repr.DiffuseColor=[0.5,0.8,0]
       # Animate
       cues.append(servermanager.animation.KeyFrameAnimationCue())
       # Visibility is a property on the representation, not the sphere itself.
       cues[i].AnimatedProxy = repr
       cues[i].AnimatedPropertyName = "Visibility"
       keyf0 = servermanager.animation.CompositeKeyFrame()
       keyf0.KeyTime = 0
       keyf0.KeyValues=0
       keyf1 = servermanager.animation.CompositeKeyFrame()
       keyf1.KeyTime=i*ts
       keyf1.KeyValues=1
       cues[i].KeyFrames=[keyf0,keyf1]
# Doing this here so that the camera is setup correctly to view all the spheres
ResetCamera()

scene.Cues = cues
# set the number of frames in the animation.
scene.NumberOfFrames = 100
scene.PlayMode = "Sequence"
scene.Play()

Dear Stephane & Zhanping,
I tried to compile 3.8 from CVS, I did the checkout yesterday morning.

But the problem persist, with the only difference that the error now
appears after few second from the moment I click on Apply button (below the
error).

Zhanping,
unfortunately I can't send the data file out :-( (it is also 20 GB). Is
there anything I can do to get more debugging output?

Thank you for your help,
Luca

Did you compile it yourself?  You could compile with debug information
and attach a debugger to find out where it is happening.

Subject: [Paraview]  PV3.8.0 RC1 LIC and VisIt plugins
Message-ID: <4BC82AD6.8080709@onera.fr>

Hello

Two questions about PV3.8.0 RC1:

1. Is there somewhere a "how to" about using the LIC plugin?

Using my own data with a simple 3D structured grid (vts) that has 
vectors, I extract a 2D grid, then I try to apply the "LIC on 2D 
structured grid" filter and PV crashes!

Then, trying to reproduce the picture that is on the "PV 3.8 news" page, 
I read the disk file, extract a contour, then try to view it as "Surface 
LIC" and PV freezes!

2. VisIt plugin: there are two VisIt plugins, one in the plugins folder, 
one in the lib folder. Which one is the good one?

Best regards

Hello,

I'm trying to convert my custom data to VTK mapper to using the VTK classes

How can I present the  PImage Writer class with pre-segmented data to

Interesting to see a Manta plugin has been added. I can't get it to
compile though, as it seems SSE isn't enabled during compilation (no
-msse[2] and/or MANTA_SSE isn't defined). With the latest manta from SVN
I get:

1. I'll let LIC devs reply.

2. The VisIt plugin you should use is the one in lib\paraview-3.8. The one
you are seeing in bin is from a duplicate install rule that I will fix right
now.

Thank you for your report!

When you configure manta, try turning MANTA_SSE off.
Then run manta to make sure that manta itself is working.
Then rebuild paraview and try the manta plugin.

You may want to ping the manta mailing list about why SSE isn't found
on your platform and why that code path in DynBVH fails when it isn't.

I have PARAVIEW_ENABLE_PYTHON to OFF (the default it seems as I didn't
touch it) and get this compile error with PV 3.8rc1:

Should the pqBlotShell even be built in this case or should
PARAVIEW_ENABLE_PYTHON not have any influence on this?
I do have the python headers installed, btw.

Oh, and is posting to this list the preferred way to give feedback on
release candidates or would paraview-developers and/or mantis be a
better place?

Bye,

Costs a lot of performance though... (8.7 fps instead 18 for the
standard manta demo).

Well, the Manta configuration *does* find SSE. It seems it's Paraview
that isn't compiling against Manta in the correct way. This could be due
to $MANTA_BUILD_DIR/MantaConfigure.cmake not adding any SSE-related
compile flags when it should. The end result is that -msse[2] and
-DMANTA_SSE are not passed to g++ when it's compiling the manta-related
sources in Paraview.

By the way, on a Vis09 presentation by Jon Woodrig, yourself and others
it is mentioned that you should configure manta with MANTA_USE_X11 to
OFF. Is that really needed? This causes the bin/manta executable to stop
working, probably because it can't open a window or something like that.
That makes it hard to test if manta itself is actually working before
loading it in paraview, or is there another way for doing that test?

Paul

As far as I know you don't _need_ to turn off X11 in manta to use it
in ParaView - I never do. Although I can think of reasons why it
_might_ make sense to do so I am not really sure why we made that
recommendation back then.

Thanks for the detailed report on the SSE config. I will fix that.
Please also file a bug report on ParaView's bug tracker to help me not
forget it if I get too busy to get to it today.

That sounds like an OpenGL error to me. What graphics card are you
using? What platform? What version of graphics drivers?
The LIC code is very testy when it comes to graphics cards (one of the
reasons why it still sits out as a plugin instead of being included in
ParaView proper).

Paul, you are correct, the plugin should not be built if
PARAVIEW_ENABLE_PYTHON is OFF. Dave, can we make sure that the plugin
in OFF if PARAVIEW_ENABLE_PYTHON is OFF? One reliable way would be to
simply add and IF(PARAVIEW_ENABLE_PYTHON) block around the entire
CMakeLists.txt in Plugins/pvblot.

Posting to mailing list works just fine -- either developers or users.

If someone can send me simple xdmf sample with tensors, I can easily
track this down.

I thought this was fixed at some time, I may be wrong. Either way, look at the Xdmf reader code, scan through for references to tensors and tweak it to say 6 instead of 9 (or whatever), you can make it work for a quick fix.

Luca:

    Please try debugging it as Paul suggested and send the dump info to me.
The parallel EnSight reader was added recently and there may be some unknown
bugs, which may occur from parsing CASE files, reading geometry files, to
loading data attribute files.

    Thanks.

Well, I finally got the plugin to work (after having to recompile PV as
it hadn't shared libs enabled and therefore could not load any plugins;
would it be an idea to force BUILD_SHARED_LIBS to ON whenever at least
one plugin is going to be built?).

I noticed there was a separate window showing the manta output a second
time, but that probably isn't caused by the X11 setting?

make install also doesn't seem to copy over all the manta stuff, I'll
file a separate bug for that.

I would be in favor of the reverse where plugins aren't available as an
option unless building as shared.

Subject: [Paraview] please help do constuct 3d surface chart from csv file
Message-ID: <v2j1a6731ca1004160727t9e8b07b5pe007161d9d0d95c9@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I want to use Paraview to construct a 3d surface chart from data that
I have in a csv file.

The data does not need any further manipulation. The file consists of
3 columns representing the x,y,z values of the points that I want to
plot

I have been able to open the file in Paraview  - and applied the
"table to points" filter. I can see the data in the spreadsheet view
but do not know how to create a 3d view. When I split the window and
click the 3d view option nothing is displayed.

Regards

Chris

I just verified that it works as expected -- it converts the 6
component symmetric tensor to a 9 component tensor. Also you may want
to add the DataType="Float" or similar attribute to your DataItem.

Are you using ParaView 3.6.* or earlier? If that's the case, give the
3.8 release candidates a try.

Either way, look at the Xdmf reader code, scan through for references to tensors and tweak it to say 6 instead of 9 (or whatever), you can make it work for a quick fix.

Another option would be to print a message if any plugin is enabled
and shared libraries if OFF. It's perfectly legal to build static
plugins to be included into static applications.

Hi Utkarsh.

I would like to use the LIC plugin because it is exactly what I am 
looking for to plot skin friction lines on an aircraft skin. I tried it 
on a Linux-x86_64 Workstation (HP xw4200) with Redhat 2.6.18-92.el5 and 
an NVidia graphic card Quadro FX 1400 (Driver version 180.22).
Next week I will also try the Windows version on my personal computer 
with an Nvidia GeForce card (don't know the version, the computer is at 
home). What could help me is the pvsm state file that has been used to 
produce the picture on the "PV 3.8 news" page with the oil flow on an 
isosurface of the disk example. Is it available somewhere?

Best regards

Yes, that isn't related to X11, it is part of the way vtkManta works
in ParaView and a proper fix is on my long term goal list. In the
meantime, you can get around it only if you compile a server to run in
pure offscreen mode and connect to that.

CVS commits to these repositories have been disabled.  I will complete
the final conversions of history today and over the weekend.  Meanwhile,
the Wiki pages have been updated to point to the permanent repo URLs:

  http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK/Git
  http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Git

The histories at these URLs are still *experimental*, so please do not
develop real work on them yet.  They only go through March 30 anyway.

Richard:

   Have you tried the following 5 LIC tests?

   TestSurfaceLIC
   TestImageDataLIC2D
   TestStructuredGridLIC2DXSlice
   TestStructuredGridLIC2DYSlice
   TestStructuredGridLIC2DZSlice

   If they fail or crash, it is most likely that the problem is due to the
OpenGL, GPU, and driver issues (as Utkarsh mentioned).

Utkarsh.

Thank you for the info and the PVSM file.
I have checked the autoload checkbox for VisIt plugin and SurfaceLIC 
plugin. Both are loaded when I start PV. Trying the steps you followed 
gives this error when I select "Surface Lic".

Same thing when using your PVSM file.

In addition, the 3D windows seems frozen and PV crashes (not each time) 
when I try to change "SurfaceLIC" for "Surface" or something else.

I will perform other tests with the Windows version on next week.

Message-ID: <t2ycf8ff04e1004160853r7604e8c1qbe0b9937657a5e47@mail.gmail.com>

Good Morning,
  I have encountered a problem with the contour filter with computer
normals set on.

My configuration is a Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 5.4
(Tikanga) server running 32 pvserver processes, openmpi 1.4.1, Mesa
7.6 (OSMesa).
a Fedora release 11 (Leonidas) workstation running the client.
Both are CVS ParaView-3-8 builds updated after the calculator fix was
applied (very fast thank you).

I load a dataset with 2 vectors and a scalar all floats using VPIC reader.
I run 1 of the vectors through the calculator to compute magnitude.
  Result array has range [.250244, .572473]
I then run that result into a contour, which will do 1 of 2 things:
If I un-check compute normals : contour works as expected (attached).
If compute normals is checked :
   it takes a long time to produce a bad contour (attached) with
errant lines OR the server segfaults

If the server segfaults it is worthy of note that the information tab
of the Calculator then reports the Result array as having
range[0.0,3.57...+38]
If I delete the contour and the calculator, create a new calculator,
calculate magnitude it reports range as [0.0,3.57...+38]

Seems like a problem ...

I will work at finding a more simple example...

Thanks,
--John Patchett.

Zhanping:

I am ready to make other tests, but I am new to LIC. What are these 
tests? Where can they be found?
If you are speaking of the Filter "LIC on 2D structured grid", I have 
made this test with an aircraft skin in a multiblock 2D structured grid: 
I load the VTM file, I use the calculator to build a vector from the U, 
V, W scalar components, I apply the "Surface Vector" filter to make sure 
that the vector is everywhere tangent to the surface, then I apply the 
"LIC on 2D structured grid" filter and PV crashes!
I think I will make other tests with the Windows version on my personal 
computer that has a more recent graphic card than  my office workstation.

   Go to the paraview build directory and type 'CTest -R LIC', which will
invoke the tests.

John,

I believe the generate normals option requests a layer of ghost cells.  Are you sure your reader is responding properly to that?

This fix will be committed after the git transition.  I also fixed another
bug about adding scalar bars to the correct view when a state has multiple
views.  Also added a new test.

Hi Ken,
  Thanks for responding,  it would appear that the reader is not
responding correctly regarding ghost cells.
It is now apparent that ghost cells are my problem and resolving that
will have to happen somewhere with the
data writer and the reader.  Fortunately I know both.

Thanks for pointing it out,
--John.

Hi Richard,
I diagnosed a problem yesterday on both a Fedora 11 and Fedora 12 box
with NVidia Graphics Cards where ParaView 3.8 would "go to lunch"
connecting with  gdb we noted each time it was in an OpenGL call.
I replaced the NVidia 195.36.15 driver with 185.18.31 and haven't had
a problem since...

Your problem sounds very similar.

--John.

Subject: [Paraview] Vtu file issue

(Replying back to the ParaView mailing list because, contrary to popular opinion, I don't know everything. :)

Now that I'm looking at it, implementing this in ParaView is a bit harder than I originally thought.  However, it is pretty easy to write a VTK (not ParaView) Python script to convert the one data set to a series of data files.  I have attached such a script.  You need to run this with vtkpython (as opposed to, say pvpython or in the ParaView GUI).  I'm not sure if this executable comes with the ParaView binaries, but it definitely something that is built from the ParaView source.

The "right" way to implement this would be to create a new reader for ParaView that used the vtu format and the odd array-name-is-time convention.  It should be pretty trivial for a developer, but not something I would want to be someone's first experience with ParaView.

Thanks for the reply.

Now I am thinking to split the original vtu file to a series of vtu files according time series,

I can use the reader to get the data info as follow,
reader=XMLUnstructuredGridReader(FileName=fname);

when writing each individual vtu file, I need to delete other variables except the one corresponding to current time instance. Now the problem is that I can not get the data, all I got from the reader is data information. Do you know how to change the data structure of reader so XMLUnstructureedGridWriter(Input=reader,FileName=fname) can be used to generate the new files?

I am totally new to Paraview, and any suggestions is welcome.

Thanks,

Ken

The most straightforward way to do something like that would be to create a filter that reports a time series based on the variables it encounters in RequestInformation and then selects the appropriate variable (with proper name change) in RequestData.

Say the variable is x, and at each time instance its value was stored with x_001, x_002,x_003,....x_100. So now I am wondering how to combine these to a single variable x with time indices in Paraview. Your input is highly appreciated!

Subject: [Paraview] Camera orbit from Python?
Message-ID: <8DB0AD9D-44FD-477B-B950-F621197E3F0A@cs.duke.edu>

Hey all,

Is there an easy way to set up the camera "orbit" mode for ParaView animations from Python (so I can do batch runs), or any examples I could follow? 

It looks like I should be able to reverse-engineer it by setting things up in the Animation View and then printing out all of the properties of the CameraKeyFrame objects in the python shell, but I thought I'd check first if there are any simpler ways.

Thanks,
-Eric

Hi,

Thanks Ken.

I'm using 3.8 now, but am have some similar troubles.  To recap: I'm using unstructured triangular grid.  The 'dimensions' variables include integer identifiers for triangle nodes, but NOT lat,long and depth.  Rather, these are included among the 'variables' variables (e.g. lat = lat(node)).

Paraview is reading in the data correctly.  But I need it to use the 'variable' variables lat, long, and depth to serve as the coordinates of the grid.  All other 'variables' variables are of course functions of the 'dimensions' variables only, but are to be plotted over the 3D space determined by lat, long and depth.  

Can this be done in Paraview?

thanks
Joel

Subject: Re: [Paraview] trouble reading in netCDF file
 
The netCDF reader in version understands the COARDS convention (a common subset of CF).  It sounds like the variable annotation you describe should be supported.  However, one major limitation of the netCDF reader is that it only supports reading variables of the same dimensions because it puts them all on the same grid.  So if you have selected to load variables with different dimensions, it will use the dimensions of the first variable and fail to load the rest.  That would explain the behavior you are getting since most netCDF files I have run into seem to have variables with low dimension listed first. (There is no particular reason for this.  It just seems to be what people/applications do.) If this is the case, you are probably also getting a lot of warnings from the netCDF reader about it and the Information panel will be missing many of your variables.  Try turning off all variables in the Object Inspector and turning on only one variable you are interested in.

If this is the problem, it should go away in version 3.8.  Realizing this the 3.6 interface to the netCDF reader really sucks, I changed it to select dimensions instead of variables.  All variables conforming to the selected dimensions are loaded.  It makes using the netCDF reader much easier and problems like the one I described go away.  I also expanded the reader to understand most of the CF convention.

Unfortunately, don't use the CVS for this just yet.  I have recently discovered that a new netCDF reader that was apparently built for a specific use case but seems to screw up on most data was added to ParaView and it is overriding the existing netCDF reader.  We are trying to work on a resolution.

Hi,

Thank you Ken for responding.

I suspect that your diagnosis is correct; the root of the problem, I believe, is that I am reading in netCDF data that follows the CF convention.   In particular, the grid is an unstructured triangular 2D grid ('poly data' grid in the venacular of paraview).  The 'dimensions' variables include integer identifiers for triangle nodes, but NOT lat, long, x, y, time etc.  Rather, these are included among the 'variables' variables (e.g. lat = lat(node)).

Is the problem indeed that the paraview netCDF reader cannot understand this particular netCDF-CF file?  Is there a way around this, without having to change the way the data is outputted (from netCDF-CF to netCDF-COARDS convention)?  Note that I can read into paraview certain variables by filtering out the 1-dimensional variables (lat, long etc.), but of course these variables do not have the correct dependencies (they should be dependent on the variables I filtered out - lat, long etc.)

thanks,
Joel

It sounds like you are reading in an array with 0 or 1 dimensions (not including time).  Although the reader should happily create an image data of that structure, the standard rendering views only understand image data of 2 or 3 dimensions.  Hence you get the error.

If you want to see the data in a plot, try adding the "Plot Data" filter.

Hi,

I am trying to read in a netCDF file using Paraview 3.6.2.  It can 'see' the netCDF file, but when I attempt to read in the file by pressing 'Apply', I get the following error message:

ERROR: In /home/kitware/ParaView3/Utilities/BuildScripts/ParaView-3.6/ParaView3/Servers/Filters/vtkTexturePainter.cxx, line 280
vtkTexturePainter (0xb8a0000): Incorrect dimensionality.

I'm not sure which netCDF release created the netCDF file.  However, I read in a previous post that paraview 3.6.1 could handle netCDF 4, and since  "all netCDF files ever written can always be read by the latest netCDF release. That is, we guarantee backward data compatibility" then 3.6.2 should be able to handle my netCDF file (which wasn't created too recently).

I can read the netCDF file into MATLAB, so it isn't corrupt.

So what's the problem?

thanks
Joel

Once you split and create the 3D view, click on the eyeball next to
the "Table To Points" filter to turn visibility of the data generated
by that filter in the 3D view to ON.

Yes, you can use the "SelectionQuerySource" to construct your query as follows:

selection_source_540 = SelectionQuerySource( InsideOut=0,
ArrayName='', HierarchicalLevel=-1, ProcessID=-1, ContainingCells=0,
DoubleValues=None, HierarchicalIndex=-1, FieldType='CELL',
ArrayComponent=0, Operator='IS_ONE_OF', TermMode='ID',
CompositeIndex=-1, IdTypeValues=0 )

You can use the python trace recorder functionality to determine how
to create the query. You will, however have to "Extract Selection"
from the query (and hit apply) before the selection_source object will
appear in the trace.

After that, you'll probably need delaunay 2d.

What do you mean by "selected by the user"? Through the ParaView
selection mechanism or some variable in the data? Also, what do you
mean by "read out"? What is the end goal?

Hi Stefan,

I am afraid what you are trying to do is not supported. I am saying
"not supported" rather than "impossible" because someone smarter than
me may be able to figure it out. We never envisioned it as a use case.
I think you have two choices: use C++ to extend ParaView or use PyQt
from python/pvpython building the GUI from scratch. If you are
interested in the second case, I have some code that shows how to
embed the render window(s) into PyQt widgets.

Hi Berk,

"by selected by the user" I mean the selection mechanism in Paraview. It 
would be nice to be able to loop through these selected points and get 
their coordinates and RegionId. That's also why I wanted to know if the 
actual PointData can be read out in Python.

Given some Polydata as a Contouring>Connectivity result, the goal is 
that the users selects a few out of many objects and calls a plugin that 
processes these objects. The selection should be as easy as to simply 
click on the object (object = set of points with equal RegionId). So, 
one click should select all points with the same Region ID. I have 
already posted that this functionality would be nice to have but until 
then I have to find some workaround.

Sadly, I am a little sparse on time so I will not dive into the 
vtkExtractSelection Filter to extract whole objects on the base of cell 
representatives. I will do the following: All selected points will be 
extracted and written into a file containing only their coordinate and 
region ID (done already). Python will open that file, read out all 
RegionIDs and do the nice FindData selection to select all cells with 
these RegionIDy and extract them. Now the user can verify if he selected 
the right objects, just as if Paraview was able to select a complete 
object with a simple click.
(in case you wonder: the coordinates are needed for correspondance to 
the original volume data that will be analyzed with ITK classses).

Paraview is a great tool and the results that I have already achieved 
are very good. This "object selection" issue is the only thing that 
works against me. What would already help a extreme lot is if one could 
activate some kind of "multiselect", so that the users doesn't have to 
use the CTRL-Key when selecting the next object (cell). Forgetting this 
one time kills the whole selection that you were doing for the last 15 
minutes in a bad case. Or maybe an option that warns about losing your 
current selection when turned on.

Best regards,
Christian

Hi Utkarsh,

these are great news. I tried the python trace but not in combination 
with the extraction (what I acutally do need anyway....)

As you might remember I am working around the "lack" of possibilty to 
select whole objects (cells with same RegionID). With the given 
SelectionQuerySource this workaround is complete.

There remains one issue: At some point I call an ExtractSelection() in 
Python that is followed by a call to a vtk-Plugin (which writes the 
point data of the selected points to disk). The resulting file is empty, 
because the Extraction takes a few seconds and obviously the plugin has 
no valid input when being executed. Paraview also crashes as a 
consequence. When I am doing this manually (trigger ExtractSelection, 
wait until it's done, call the vtk Plugin to write the point data) 
everything works fine. I could just go ahead and do a dull time.sleep(3) 
between the extraction and the call to the plugin, but this certainly 
isn't good programming style.

What can I do instead?


Best regards,
Christian

Thanks for the tips Eric, I will look into these techniques although for a Paraview scripting newbie this is quickly getting in over my head!

Meanwhile I started on another approach, which may also benefit from the techniques you have pointed me to. I saved a LUT from the Paraview GUI (Edit Color Map | Choose Preset | Export) and used this as an example to help me write a custom LUT for each scalar and save it in an xml file. I can then Import the LUT into Paraview, but only in interactive mode, I'd really like to be able to script it all so I can automatically generate an image for each scalar.

I took things further than just a compressed range and constructed a LUT for each scalar based on histogram equalisation of the scalar data. This works great and will be a more general solution for data with arbitrary distributions. But how to automate it all ! I Also must poke around and check there is a filter in Paraview (or vtk) already that does histogram equalization. The topic is covered in the vtk book, and would seem to be a useful visualisation trick. A quick peek on Google suggests 'maybe' in ITK... so I may be doing this myself after all.

I am making progress and your tips may well be good pieces for my jigsaw.

Hey Dave,

If you want to retrieve the attribute data to make the calculations then you can call

servermanager.Fetch()

to pull from the server to the client. You can see examples on:

http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/ParaView/Python_Scripting

If your data is very large, though, it might be tough to do this. If you look at the above page it talks about passing algorithms as the optional arguments, like vtkMinMax, which will process the data on the server and send a result to the client. I'm not sure all of what would be involved (probably making a plugin that you can load with your custom class), but you may be able to make a quantile filter in place of vtkMinMax and pass that to Fetch().

Another thing I've done is to use a Python Programmable Filter (PPF) to do something similar to what vtkMinMax is doing: Calculate statistics on my data set and output a single point which has the calculated attributes (such as mean of all input attributes). Maybe you could just output a two-point polydata from your PPF in which each point contains the 5 and 95 percentiles for every attribute, and then Fetch that data to set the LUT ranges?

Hope this helps,
-Eric

I am developing a python script to visualise point data (unstructured grid) with a large number of scalar values for each point.
My problem is some of the scalar data is a bit noisy, i.e. a histogram of the values has a long tail at one or both ends, which effectively reduces the useful range of color in the visualisation. I would like to determine the 5 and 95 percentiles for each data array and use these as the range for the LUT. And I would like to do this from my python script. I can't figure out how to get at the underlying point data, as it would then be very easily to calculate a restricted range.
See my current script below.

Thanks in advance for any help, Dave

Subject: [Paraview] Viewing an Image Stack?
Message-ID: <D44888894DD04A5FA7B7734772DF6E46@notebook>

Hi,

This is hopefully a silly question...

Is is possible to point ParaView to a tiff directory and volume render a
contained image stack? 

I have a directory with images named vol2-0001...vol2-0882.tiff. When I open
the directory ParaView "seems" to want to load them all by the wildcard name
"vol2-..tif" and once loaded it gives me the option to switch to "Volume".
However the Object Inspector is only showing vol2-0001.tiff and I am only
seeing one slice.

I have viewing working via ImageJ (i.e. converting the images to a raw
stack) however as the data sets get bigger the ImageJ conversion becomes a
painfull step. It seem logical to me that ParaView should be able to do it
but I can't work it out (I'm on the 3.8 RC).

Cheers,

Paul

Hi John,

I also installed PV 3.8 on my Toshiba laptop with Vista-32 and Nvidia 
Geforce 8700 M GT graphic card. I tested LIC on a full aircrtaft skin 
with Euler flow vectors and LIC works fine... and very quickly! No time 
to "go to lunch"! Great job!

For my office Linux workstation, I can't change the Nvidia driver 
because I am not the administrator. But we have more recent Linux 
workstations than mine and I will try to make some tests. Thank you for 
your answer.

Richard

Is there a way to change the font for the legend text?  In the chart

Is it in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH though?
Or visible via '/sbin/ldconfig -p' ?

OK, the problem is solved: PV3.8 LIC plugin works on our most recent 
Linux workstations. I have to convince my boss to replace my old one. 
Thank you all for your answers.

Oops, forgot the platform details. It's on 32-bit Linux, with PV 3.8 RC1
compiled against Qt 4.6.2 (the SDK version).

Hi,
I previously built PV 3.8 RC1 with cmake 2.6.4 successfully. I've now

This is using a new and empty build directory, so no previous state from

seems this would be cmake-related?

Hi Paul,

That's a known issue with PV 3.8 RC1 and CVS HEAD when compiling from scratch,
occurring on 64bit Linux systems, but not on 32bit Linux nor 64bit Solaris
SPARC. Don't know about Mac or Windows.

It is caused by PARAVIEW_GENERATE_PROXY_DOCUMENTATION:BOOL=ON. Set it to OFF and
you'll not get help for sources, filters, readers & writers, but compilation
will succeed. Dave is already aware of the fact and working on it.

(It should have nothing to do with the cmake version. When using cmake 2.6.4 you
probably built incrementally, right?)

Sven

Thank you for finding this bug, I have fixed this on the development branch,
and I will have this fixed for the final 3.8 release.

When you configure paraview with cmake, do you have both libmpi.so and
libmpi_cxx (in MPI_LIBRARY, MPI_EXTRA_LIBRARY)?

The new GPU accelerated volume rendering algorithm is only for Image Data.

Your data must be unstructured, because you are seeing the
unstructured grid volume rendering algorithms, which have not been
updated.

You can simply call UpdatePipeline() as follows:

from paraview.simple import *
....
UpdatePipeline(proxy=extractSelectionSource)

This will update the extract selection filter explicitly. Look at
help(UpdatePipeline) for details.

Message-ID: <AB48A31C4EC97E498F4235B7CEF74A19060D2FDD7C@MBX00.d.ethz.ch>

Hello

Can one write a Python Programmable Filter with multiple outputs?

I tried the obvious self.SetNumberOfOutputPorts(2), which complained, and in any case, I wonder how it would interact with the GUI option which defines the output Data Set Type. Since there is a single option, I guess I wouldn't be able to define two different ports with different types.

Another output option would be a CompositeDataSet with 2 datasets, but it seems the GUI does not let me define the output type to be vtkCompositeDataSet?

Am I forced to go back to a C++ filter?

No, it's not possible to write a python programmable filter with
multiple output ports. The number of output ports needs to be set in
the constructor of the class itself which is too early to be able to
set by the user from the panel for any filter. Workaround is producing
a multi-block.

Hi David.

Ok for

If the issue is indeed scale, then you can apply the Transform filter
to scale the points.

Does your data have time? If not, you don't need to specify the
time=10000 attribute at all. So SelectionWriter is the thing that's
coming from your plugin? Does it support writing empty datasets?  Can
you attach a debugger and see where is crashes? Are you sure it's not
crashing in the writer? I dont' see why UpdatePipeline() on extract
selection would crash. Instead of using a macro, try manually typing
the text in the python shell to see exactly what line causes the
segfault.

BTW, ExtractSelection needs two inputs: 'Input" and "Selection" where
Selection is set to the SelectionQuerySource proxy.

Well, not the first time I built the release candidate, obviously. That
was in a separate clean directory as well, and I didn't have that error.

We're pleased to announce the completion of the repository conversion.
The CVS repositories have been permanently frozen (though I'll be adding
one extra commit to them to point folks that try them at the new repos).

Development of VTK, ParaView, IceT, and Xdmf is now officially hosted
by Git.  All repositories may be browsed online via gitweb:

  http://vtk.org/gitweb
  http://paraview.org/gitweb

The individual gitweb pages show the repository URLs.
The git clone/fetch URLs for the repositories are:

  git://vtk.org/VTK.git
  git://vtk.org/VTKData.git
  git://paraview.org/ParaView.git
  git://paraview.org/ParaViewData.git
  git://public.kitware.com/IceT.git
  git://public.kitware.com/Xdmf.git

Replace "git://" with "http://" to get http protocol access.

>   http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK/Git
>   http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Git

The Wiki pages have been updated to refer to the official repositories.
Additional documentation about branches, submodules, workflow, update
hooks (previously known as commit checks in CVS) will be added in the
coming weeks.

IMPORTANT NOTE: The official histories now published at the above
URLs are *incompatible* with all previous Git repositories for these
projects.  You *must* do a *fresh* clone from scratch.  Please do not
try to pull into an existing clone that was created from the CVS->Git
tracking repositories or any experimental repository previously
published (even at the above URLs from any date before 2010-04-19).

In order to reduce confusion we've deleted the Github and Gitorious
repositories that previously published the CVS->Git tracking repos.
Furthermore, the new repositories will not yet accept merge commits.
Please rebase your work on master before pushing to them.  We will
switch to a branchy workflow once things have settled.

-Brad

FYI, if anyone has non-trivial topic branches under development based
on a clone of one of the older repositories, it is possible to rebase
the branch on the new official history.  I can post instructions if
anyone needs to do this.

Does that mean that I have to create a selection with explicitly 
defining the points? Oh man... Then I can forget the whole thing anyway.

Everything is so nice about Paraview, but this selection thing is 
driving me mad.

It's still all about making it as easy as possible for the user to 
select objects out of Polydata and let a plugin analyze these objects. 
As it seems now, the user has to:

1) Ctrl+Click matching objects one after another (already dangerours, 
because you might forget to hold down Ctrl when selecting)
2) go to Filter->Recent->ExtractSelection
3) wait at least 3 seconds
4) call a plugin that writes the extracted points' coordinates and their 
ID to a file
5) call the analyzing plugin that reads out the file (to get the 
RegionID and coordinates) and does the analysing stuff (in ITK)

I have found a way to do that "wait 3 seconds" in Python using a 
thread(!) which checks the time and joins after some seconds. Using 
sleep(5) simply froze everything and postponed the segmentation fault 
(which clearly comes from my writer that doesn't have input). Another 
possibility would be to modify vtkExtractSelection to suite my needs, 
but I won't do that, since I don't have time for that anymore. This 
workaround has to do.

Anyway, Paraview, VTK and ITK are really nice, I am glad I found these 
open-source tools.

Best regards,
Christian

OS X 10.5.8 using ParaView 3.8 branch (Just updated today).

  when I do a "Make install" I get the ParaView.app bundle created but  
my custom plugins that I added to the build using the  
EXTERNAL_MODULES" technique are NOT being added to the "Plugins"  
directory in the final app bundle. I thought this was fixed?

Dave,

Did you every update the bundle-building script to use the CMAKE
variable paraview defines that lists all the plugins instead of hard
coding them in the packaging script?

Yeah, in this change the CompleteBundle.cmake.in script should package
everything that is accumulated in ${PARAVIEW_PLUGINLIST}.

It is on both cvs HEAD and the final version of the cvs ParaView-3-8 branch.
We haven't finalized how the branch will be accessed in git (yet) but I will
let you know as soon as it is.

Subject: [Paraview] Xdmf GlobalID attribute removed by Clip
Message-ID: <DAC47FBD-51E5-48D8-97A6-0424F1467442@cs.duke.edu>

Hello,

It seems that we're sort of getting the worst of both worlds right now ParaView and Xdmf GlobalID AttributeType: Besides not being read in as "idtype", a Clip filter removes the GlobalID attribute from the data set.

Attached is a simple XML example adapted from the Xdmf source data sets, but with a duplicate scalar point attribute labeled as AttributeType="GlobalID". Load it into PV and apply a Clip filter and you'll see the IDvalues array disappear.

I see this behavior with PV 3.8-RC1 and last week's CVS, but not with 3.6.2. I can't remember if the Xdmf reader in 3.6.2 had GlobalID type or not. (OS X 10.6.3)

I can file a bug report for this if someone can replicate it.

Thanks a lot,
-Eric

I'm looking to create animations of datasets in Paraview by settig

Can someone please give me any pointers?

I believe it is now View->Animation View

If you don't have that either, then my guess is you have an old version of
Paraview.

Hey Pat,

I just ran up against this same problem, but with my evidently sieve-like brain I totally forgot that you had told me the answer less than two months ago...

I think something really needs to be done about the "first Render() causes a camera reset" default. I was telling my users how easy it is to set up batch animation scripts now that there is the Trace State functionality. But, as we were working on it I couldn't figure out why the camera wasn't being positioned correctly even though the camera configuration gets saved right at the beginning of the state trace with the render view parameters.

Eventually I did an extra Render() in the command window and then things were set up correctly after that, and I remembered...

If the default is going to stay like this (I still completely understand the original reasoning), then could the Trace State give an extra Render and then the camera parameters and Render again? This falls through the cracks when a saved state trace is run with "Run selected"...

Thanks,
-Eric

Eric,

I too am interested in texture mapping a 3d mesh object (having texture 
coordinates). How to I use the script you provided?

In addition, I know the mesh can be in PVD format, but how do I specify 
the texture coordinates as well as the texture?

Thanks,

pdi = self.GetPolyDataInput()
pdo = self.GetPolyDataOutput()

Varray = pdi.GetPointData().GetArray('V')

tc = vtk.vtkDoubleArray()
tc.SetNumberOfComponents(2)
tc.SetNumberOfTuples(numPts)
tc.SetName('TCoords')

for ii in range(numPts):
   Uval = Uarray.GetTuple1(ii)

We could add a call such as 'DisableResetCameraOnFirstRender()' to the top
of all trace scripts.  Or I could add the flag to the view constructor-
view = CreateRenderView(ResetCameraOnFirstRender=False).  My first
preference would be to just get rid of the reset camera behavior.  I'd have
to update some of the python tutorials to add calls to ResetCamera().

I'm running Paraview 3.8.0 (RC1). I've found the Animation View and I'm 
trying to figure out how it works.

On a not too unrelated note, is it possible to use the "Record Test" 
Tool feature to record a work session so that it can be rendered out as 
an animation?

Subject: [Paraview] trouble reading in netCDF file

Message-ID: <C7F21730.1B08F%kmorel@sandia.gov>

I don't really understand this description, but I can say with confidence that the netCDF reader will not read this convention.  The CF convention does not support unstructured triangular grids (or any unstructured grids, for that matter).  The (general) netCDF reader knows how to read 1-, 2-, and 3-D arrays as regular grids with some conventions on setting coordinates to the points in the grid.

NetCDF is not a data format description.  It is simply an I/O library that specifies how to read/write arrays with some annotation.  Thus, if you have data in a netCDF file that has a structure more complicated than simple arrays, you will have to create a reader that understands how to construct the data format.  From your description, it sounds like you will have to create your own reader.

Hi,

Thanks Ken.

I'm using 3.8 now, but am have some similar troubles.  To recap: I'm using unstructured triangular grid.  The 'dimensions' variables include integer identifiers for triangle nodes, but NOT lat,long and depth.  Rather, these are included among the 'variables' variables (e.g. lat = lat(node)).

Paraview is reading in the data correctly.  But I need it to use the 'variable' variables lat, long, and depth to serve as the coordinates of the grid.  All other 'variables' variables are of course functions of the 'dimensions' variables only, but are to be plotted over the 3D space determined by lat, long and depth.

Can this be done in Paraview?

thanks
Joel

Subject: Re: [Paraview] trouble reading in netCDF file

The netCDF reader in version understands the COARDS convention (a common subset of CF).  It sounds like the variable annotation you describe should be supported.  However, one major limitation of the netCDF reader is that it only supports reading variables of the same dimensions because it puts them all on the same grid.  So if you have selected to load variables with different dimensions, it will use the dimensions of the first variable and fail to load the rest.  That would explain the behavior you are getting since most netCDF files I have run into seem to have variables with low dimension listed first. (There is no particular reason for this.  It just seems to be what people/applications do.) If this is the case, you are probably also getting a lot of warnings from the netCDF reader about it and the Information panel will be missing many of your variables.  Try turning off all variables in the Object Inspector and turning on only one variable you are interested in.

If this is the problem, it should go away in version 3.8.  Realizing this the 3.6 interface to the netCDF reader really sucks, I changed it to select dimensions instead of variables.  All variables conforming to the selected dimensions are loaded.  It makes using the netCDF reader much easier and problems like the one I described go away.  I also expanded the reader to understand most of the CF convention.

Unfortunately, don't use the CVS for this just yet.  I have recently discovered that a new netCDF reader that was apparently built for a specific use case but seems to screw up on most data was added to ParaView and it is overriding the existing netCDF reader.  We are trying to work on a resolution.

Hi,

Thank you Ken for responding.

I suspect that your diagnosis is correct; the root of the problem, I believe, is that I am reading in netCDF data that follows the CF convention.   In particular, the grid is an unstructured triangular 2D grid ('poly data' grid in the venacular of paraview).  The 'dimensions' variables include integer identifiers for triangle nodes, but NOT lat, long, x, y, time etc.  Rather, these are included among the 'variables' variables (e.g. lat = lat(node)).

Is the problem indeed that the paraview netCDF reader cannot understand this particular netCDF-CF file?  Is there a way around this, without having to change the way the data is outputted (from netCDF-CF to netCDF-COARDS convention)?  Note that I can read into paraview certain variables by filtering out the 1-dimensional variables (lat, long etc.), but of course these variables do not have the correct dependencies (they should be dependent on the variables I filtered out - lat, long etc.)

thanks,
Joel

Subject: Re: [Paraview] trouble reading in netCDF file

It sounds like you are reading in an array with 0 or 1 dimensions (not including time).  Although the reader should happily create an image data of that structure, the standard rendering views only understand image data of 2 or 3 dimensions.  Hence you get the error.

If you want to see the data in a plot, try adding the "Plot Data" filter.

Hi,

I am trying to read in a netCDF file using Paraview 3.6.2.  It can 'see' the netCDF file, but when I attempt to read in the file by pressing 'Apply', I get the following error message:

ERROR: In /home/kitware/ParaView3/Utilities/BuildScripts/ParaView-3.6/ParaView3/Servers/Filters/vtkTexturePainter.cxx, line 280
vtkTexturePainter (0xb8a0000): Incorrect dimensionality.

I'm not sure which netCDF release created the netCDF file.  However, I read in a previous post that paraview 3.6.1 could handle netCDF 4, and since  "all netCDF files ever written can always be read by the latest netCDF release. That is, we guarantee backward data compatibility" then 3.6.2 should be able to handle my netCDF file (which wasn't created too recently).

I can read the netCDF file into MATLAB, so it isn't corrupt.

So what's the problem?

thanks
Joel

Yeah, that's a tough call...

One issue is that with VTK you don't _have_ to call ResetCamera() most of the time for simple visualizations, so it may be that Berk's worry about newbie usage may come up off and on if people coming from VTK to ParaView are used to that behavior.

I guess, ideally, it would behave something like this: If no camera settings were altered after calling the render view constructor it would automatically reset the camera, but if a users sets them explicitly then an internal flag is set not to do the reset. I don't know how feasible that would be, or how you would decide which things to auto-set if only a subset of the camera parameters were specified...

In some ways your Disable...() or Reset...=False solutions would work just fine since the current behavior works well for people just playing around on the command line, while anyone who did a Start Trace or Trace State would see the command or flag there, and it would be descriptive enough that they wouldn't just delete it without knowing what it was doing there. It would only be the people who were writing a script from scratch and adding camera controls that might not know about those commands or flags and be surprised. But, with all of the Trace functionality built in now, how big a percentage will be doing that?

Talk to you later,
-Eric

Or I could add the flag to the view constructor-  view = CreateRenderView(ResetCameraOnFirstRender=False).  My first preference would be to just get rid of the reset camera behavior.  I'd have to update some of the python tutorials to add calls to ResetCamera().

I was telling my users how easy it is to set up batch animation scripts now that there is the Trace State functionality.

If I disconnect before running it again, the "reset at end" behavior is repeated. The same thing happens when running in ipython, outside of PV.

Pushed the fixes to git.

Here is python macro I've been using to test the trace state.  I add this to
the macro toolbar so I can run it with one click.  It does a trace state,
clears all the sources & views, then executes the trace to restore your
state.  This means you can click the button at any time and you *should* get
back what you started with.  Of course, there are some pipelines that do not
restore correctly (just recently noticed the 2D Render View is not available
in python...)  Any errors that may be produced will be displayed in the
python console, but probably not echoed to stdout.

# reload_state.py
from paraview import smstate

def clear_proxies():
   groups = ["sources", "representations", "views",
                   "implicit_functions", "piecewise_functions",
                   "lookup_tables", "scalar_bars", "selection_sources"]
   for g in groups:
       for p in servermanager.ProxyManager().GetProxiesInGroup(g).values():
           Delete(p)

Hey Olumide,

Well, this script works for taking two attribute arrays which contain the U and V coordinates for the texture maps and puts them together into a single two-component array, adds that array as a new vector attribute of the polydata, and then tells the system that this array should be used as texture coordinates (rather than just any old two-component array).

What you will need to do depends on what form your data is already in, and whether you already have texture coordinates. Do you already have them, or do you just have a mesh that you want to texture?

Once you have the texture coordinates generated and applied correctly, (you can try this in ParaView by creating a Sphere Source and then running the Texture Map To Sphere filter to generate texture coordinates for it), then in the Display tab of the Object Inspector, under the Color section, the Apply Texture combo box should be enabled and you can use this to pull down to Load... to read in your texture image and apply it to your surface. (If you also want the texture to be colored by a color map, the trick is to uncheck Interpolate Scalars after choosing an array in "Color by".)

So, if this doesn't answer your questions you'll have to let us know more specifically what you are starting with.

Talk to you later,
-Eric

I don't really understand this description, but I can say with confidence that the netCDF reader will not read this convention.  The CF convention does not support unstructured triangular grids (or any unstructured grids, for that matter).  The (general) netCDF reader knows how to read 1-, 2-, and 3-D arrays as regular grids with some conventions on setting coordinates to the points in the grid.

NetCDF is not a data format description.  It is simply an I/O library that specifies how to read/write arrays with some annotation.  Thus, if you have data in a netCDF file that has a structure more complicated than simple arrays, you will have to create a reader that understands how to construct the data format.  From your description, it sounds like you will have to create your own reader.

Hi,

Thanks Ken.

I'm using 3.8 now, but am have some similar troubles.  To recap: I'm using unstructured triangular grid.  The 'dimensions' variables include integer identifiers for triangle nodes, but NOT lat,long and depth.  Rather, these are included among the 'variables' variables (e.g. lat = lat(node)).

Paraview is reading in the data correctly.  But I need it to use the 'variable' variables lat, long, and depth to serve as the coordinates of the grid.  All other 'variables' variables are of course functions of the 'dimensions' variables only, but are to be plotted over the 3D space determined by lat, long and depth.

Can this be done in Paraview?

thanks
Joel

Subject: Re: [Paraview] trouble reading in netCDF file

The netCDF reader in version understands the COARDS convention (a common subset of CF).  It sounds like the variable annotation you describe should be supported.  However, one major limitation of the netCDF reader is that it only supports reading variables of the same dimensions because it puts them all on the same grid.  So if you have selected to load variables with different dimensions, it will use the dimensions of the first variable and fail to load the rest.  That would explain the behavior you are getting since most netCDF files I have run into seem to have variables with low dimension listed first. (There is no particular reason for this.  It just seems to be what people/applications do.) If this is the case, you are probably also getting a lot of warnings from the netCDF reader about it and the Information panel will be missing many of your variables.  Try turning off all variables in the Object Inspector and turning on only one variable you are interested in.

If this is the problem, it should go away in version 3.8.  Realizing this the 3.6 interface to the netCDF reader really sucks, I changed it to select dimensions instead of variables.  All variables conforming to the selected dimensions are loaded.  It makes using the netCDF reader much easier and problems like the one I described go away.  I also expanded the reader to understand most of the CF convention.

Unfortunately, don't use the CVS for this just yet.  I have recently discovered that a new netCDF reader that was apparently built for a specific use case but seems to screw up on most data was added to ParaView and it is overriding the existing netCDF reader.  We are trying to work on a resolution.

Hi,

Thank you Ken for responding.

I suspect that your diagnosis is correct; the root of the problem, I believe, is that I am reading in netCDF data that follows the CF convention.   In particular, the grid is an unstructured triangular 2D grid ('poly data' grid in the venacular of paraview).  The 'dimensions' variables include integer identifiers for triangle nodes, but NOT lat, long, x, y, time etc.  Rather, these are included among the 'variables' variables (e.g. lat = lat(node)).

Is the problem indeed that the paraview netCDF reader cannot understand this particular netCDF-CF file?  Is there a way around this, without having to change the way the data is outputted (from netCDF-CF to netCDF-COARDS convention)?  Note that I can read into paraview certain variables by filtering out the 1-dimensional variables (lat, long etc.), but of course these variables do not have the correct dependencies (they should be dependent on the variables I filtered out - lat, long etc.)

thanks,
Joel

It sounds like you are reading in an array with 0 or 1 dimensions (not including time).  Although the reader should happily create an image data of that structure, the standard rendering views only understand image data of 2 or 3 dimensions.  Hence you get the error.

If you want to see the data in a plot, try adding the "Plot Data" filter.

Hi,

I am trying to read in a netCDF file using Paraview 3.6.2.  It can 'see' the netCDF file, but when I attempt to read in the file by pressing 'Apply', I get the following error message:

ERROR: In /home/kitware/ParaView3/Utilities/BuildScripts/ParaView-3.6/ParaView3/Servers/Filters/vtkTexturePainter.cxx, line 280
vtkTexturePainter (0xb8a0000): Incorrect dimensionality.

I'm not sure which netCDF release created the netCDF file.  However, I read in a previous post that paraview 3.6.1 could handle netCDF 4, and since  "all netCDF files ever written can always be read by the latest netCDF release. That is, we guarantee backward data compatibility" then 3.6.2 should be able to handle my netCDF file (which wasn't created too recently).

I can read the netCDF file into MATLAB, so it isn't corrupt.

So what's the problem?

thanks
Joel

Hi Eric,

Thanks for the example. I've textured my very first sphere :)

I've taken another look at the VTK file format and I now realize that it 
is possible embed extra scalar (UV) <PointData> information in a VTK/VTP 
file (I'm a novice, but I'm learning).

I've got a mesh with texture coordinates, and I can modify my external 
VTP file writer to embed texture coordinates in my VTP file, so that the 
programmable filter extracts it. Is this the correct approach? And will 
the line:

Uarray = pdi.GetPointData().GetArray('U')

in your script extract U coordinates in the file?

Regards,

- Olumide

As far as I know you will have to write your own ServerManager .xml file 
that adds the existing vtkTIFFReader in such a way that it will read a 
complete stack of images instead of just the first one. The 
vtkTIFFReader is definitely able to read volumes, so there will be a way 
to have a Paraview-Plugin that does, too. You can have a look here to 
get started:

http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Plugin_HowTo

If you are succesful please let me know, because I could use that 
tif-volume-reading too but I didn't have the time to get into this.


Best regards,
Christian

Ouch, just for fun I tried to use make -j 2 instead of a single process
make and the problem went away, i.e. the compile succeeded. That's not
very good...
Out of interest, do you always build multi-process? I'm on a dual-core
machine and when building in the background make -j N isn't very
attractive.

I think I now also got some extra help-related messages I didn't see
before, so it seems the multi-process build triggers the building of
extra stuff, which solves my build problems.

Subject: [Paraview] Display given node IDs from Ensight Gold file
Message-ID: <41CF85C0B8BE49899E5F042C70B72FB4@LIMPCMGC>

I would like to display the given node IDs in an Ensight Gold geometry file.

I tried it with the Selection Inspector ( > Display Style > Point Label:
visible (Label mode = "Point IDs"), but then Paraview displays numbers
starting from 0, not the numbers given as node IDs in the geometry file.

For example, in the following Ensight Gold case, I would like to display 13
and 22 (the given node IDs), but Paraview displays 0 and 1:

---- START OF FILE: example.case ----
#

FORMAT
type: ensight gold

GEOMETRY
model:  example.geo

---- END OF FILE: example.case ----

---- START OF FILE: example.geo ----
example

You can choose from any of the arrays in the data to make selection
labels, ParaView uses the vtk index by default. Is the ensight node ID
array not available under the Label Mode drop down menu?

Subject: [Paraview] Magic Crop Filter
Message-ID: <4BCD7A9F.70308@rwth-aachen.de>

Hi!

Today, I made a very interesting experience. I wanted to have the 
vtkImageClip functionality available in Paraview and performed the same 
steps as always to get a Paraview-Plugin out of a VTK Filter. I compiled 
the plugin, called it ImageClip and copied it over to my Paraview Plugin 
directory. Then I started Paraview. When browsing through my custom 
"Extensions" Filters-entry, I found that there is no ImageClip but a 
Crop! And this crop provided me with a nice GUI, letting me change the 
output size with spinbuttons and already providing the maximum x/y/z 
extents! Wow! It was like if Paraview said "Ah, I know that vtk Filter 
and I happen to know which parameters it likes and how to preset its 
values. You surely won't mind if I ignore your ServerManager xml and do 
all by myself, do you?"

How comes? And the most interesting part is: how can I make the 
ServerManager xml define default values that are actually variables 
(such as the image extents)? And why does Paraview handle vtkImageClip 
differently?

Best regards,
Christian

No, the only option available in the Label Mode drop menu is "Point IDs"

Any other suggestions?

BTW: I am using Paraview 3.8.0-RC1 64 bits for Windows.

Yes, I usually build with N > 1.
I just tested your hypothesis and I can confirm that (for a clean build)
it does make a difference whether one compiles with 1 or more processes.
The error > make[2]: *** No rule to make target
`Applications/ParaView/../../Documentation/paraview.qch', needed by
`Applications/ParaView/qrc_paraview_help.cxx'.  Stop.
does only occur when compiling sequentially (on 32 bit Linux). Funny to
see that on my 3 different 64 bit Linux operating systems compilation
always fails at this point, even with N > 1.

Message-ID: <l2p71cb193b1004200510kefec78b4k5fc1d56338df8fe6@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I have a set of 10 time dependant solutions written in Ensight Gold format.
I try to open them with precompiled version 3.6.2 or 3.8-RC1 on linux and
MacosX.

The first time step file is well loaded. When I try to play a sequence or to
watch another time step I have a segmentation fault (Linux) or nothing
append (MacOs).

I try this with version 3.4 and everything works fine.

I noticed that when everything is working the time appear in the box "Time:"
and staying at 0 when it's not working.

What are the differences between each versions? Ensight Gold format has
changed?

Regards,

Hi Manuel:

    It works fine on my side (CVS head + WinXP + VS90) with a sample dataset
(see the attached snapshot). Can you send me your dataset (if possible the
state file)?

    Thanks.

Subject: [Paraview] Accelerated volume rendering in 3.8.0-RC1?
In-Reply-To: <4BCD0E98.8030000@renci.org>
Message-ID: <C7F32545.14BD7%kmorel@sandia.gov>

There is no direct way to do that.  The problem is that image data is constrained to have uniform spacing and be axis aligned whereas structured grids are not.  You could build a filter to do the conversion, but it would have to rely on resampling or warping of the grid.

Thanks, Ken.
That's good to know. I always thought Tetra and HAVS are only CPU based.
And is there a way to convert my structured grid data to image data in order to enable other accelerated rendering?

Best,

Your data must be unstructured, because you are seeing the
unstructured grid volume rendering algorithms, which have not been
updated.

I'm getting the following compiling 3.8.0-rc1 on Fedora rawhide (with qt 
4.7.0).  I don't see it on Fedora 12 with qt 4.6.2 so it looks like a qt 
issue.  Anyone tried compiling paraview with 4.7.0 yet?

This is odd.  Your header states that it follows the CF convention, but your description of the data is clearly incompatible with the CF convention.  Could you send me a sample data set?

Which file(s) do I edit to create my own reader?  The new model I will be getting outputs netCDF-4 files.  Can I import unstructured netCDF-4 files into paraview with an HDF5 reader?

thanks!

Subject: Re: [Paraview] trouble reading in netCDF file

I don't really understand this description, but I can say with confidence that the netCDF reader will not read this convention.  The CF convention does not support unstructured triangular grids (or any unstructured grids, for that matter).  The (general) netCDF reader knows how to read 1-, 2-, and 3-D arrays as regular grids with some conventions on setting coordinates to the points in the grid.

NetCDF is not a data format description.  It is simply an I/O library that specifies how to read/write arrays with some annotation.  Thus, if you have data in a netCDF file that has a structure more complicated than simple arrays, you will have to create a reader that understands how to construct the data format.  From your description, it sounds like you will have to create your own reader.

Hi,

Thanks Ken.

I'm using 3.8 now, but am have some similar troubles.  To recap: I'm using unstructured triangular grid.  The 'dimensions' variables include integer identifiers for triangle nodes, but NOT lat,long and depth.  Rather, these are included among the 'variables' variables (e.g. lat = lat(node)).

Paraview is reading in the data correctly.  But I need it to use the 'variable' variables lat, long, and depth to serve as the coordinates of the grid.  All other 'variables' variables are of course functions of the 'dimensions' variables only, but are to be plotted over the 3D space determined by lat, long and depth.

Can this be done in Paraview?

thanks
Joel

Subject: Re: [Paraview] trouble reading in netCDF file

The netCDF reader in version understands the COARDS convention (a common subset of CF).  It sounds like the variable annotation you describe should be supported.  However, one major limitation of the netCDF reader is that it only supports reading variables of the same dimensions because it puts them all on the same grid.  So if you have selected to load variables with different dimensions, it will use the dimensions of the first variable and fail to load the rest.  That would explain the behavior you are getting since most netCDF files I have run into seem to have variables with low dimension listed first. (There is no particular reason for this.  It just seems to be what people/applications do.) If this is the case, you are probably also getting a lot of warnings from the netCDF reader about it and the Information panel will be missing many of your variables.  Try turning off all variables in the Object Inspector and turning on only one variable you are interested in.

If this is the problem, it should go away in version 3.8.  Realizing this the 3.6 interface to the netCDF reader really sucks, I changed it to select dimensions instead of variables.  All variables conforming to the selected dimensions are loaded.  It makes using the netCDF reader much easier and problems like the one I described go away.  I also expanded the reader to understand most of the CF convention.

Unfortunately, don't use the CVS for this just yet.  I have recently discovered that a new netCDF reader that was apparently built for a specific use case but seems to screw up on most data was added to ParaView and it is overriding the existing netCDF reader.  We are trying to work on a resolution.

Hi,

Thank you Ken for responding.

I suspect that your diagnosis is correct; the root of the problem, I believe, is that I am reading in netCDF data that follows the CF convention.   In particular, the grid is an unstructured triangular 2D grid ('poly data' grid in the venacular of paraview).  The 'dimensions' variables include integer identifiers for triangle nodes, but NOT lat, long, x, y, time etc.  Rather, these are included among the 'variables' variables (e.g. lat = lat(node)).

Is the problem indeed that the paraview netCDF reader cannot understand this particular netCDF-CF file?  Is there a way around this, without having to change the way the data is outputted (from netCDF-CF to netCDF-COARDS convention)?  Note that I can read into paraview certain variables by filtering out the 1-dimensional variables (lat, long etc.), but of course these variables do not have the correct dependencies (they should be dependent on the variables I filtered out - lat, long etc.)

thanks,
Joel

It sounds like you are reading in an array with 0 or 1 dimensions (not including time).  Although the reader should happily create an image data of that structure, the standard rendering views only understand image data of 2 or 3 dimensions.  Hence you get the error.

If you want to see the data in a plot, try adding the "Plot Data" filter.

Hi,

I am trying to read in a netCDF file using Paraview 3.6.2.  It can 'see' the netCDF file, but when I attempt to read in the file by pressing 'Apply', I get the following error message:

ERROR: In /home/kitware/ParaView3/Utilities/BuildScripts/ParaView-3.6/ParaView3/Servers/Filters/vtkTexturePainter.cxx, line 280
vtkTexturePainter (0xb8a0000): Incorrect dimensionality.

I'm not sure which netCDF release created the netCDF file.  However, I read in a previous post that paraview 3.6.1 could handle netCDF 4, and since  "all netCDF files ever written can always be read by the latest netCDF release. That is, we guarantee backward data compatibility" then 3.6.2 should be able to handle my netCDF file (which wasn't created too recently).

I can read the netCDF file into MATLAB, so it isn't corrupt.

So what's the problem?

thanks
Joel

Don't think anyone here has tried Qt 4.7 yet. Either case, ParaView
will be officially supporting only Qt 4.6 for the next two releases so
it's a bit too early for start switching to Qt 4.7 :).

Luca:

    What is the size of the compressed version of your files? or can you
re-produce the same problem with part of the files? I mean you may simply
comment some of the attribute files (which usually contribute to the overall
large dataset size) referenced in the case files (there should be multiple
case files, along with a SOS file in support of parallel EnSight data loaing
--- so please make the multiple case files consistent in terms of commenting
the attribute files) in a way to reduce the size of the dataset. Once it is
done, please send me the smallest possible files (which can be used to
re-produce the same problem).

    If the size of the smallest possible files is about 3~4 GB (or less), I
will provide you with an FTP link to upload them.

    I feel it would make things easier to have a set of data on my side to
debug the problem involving multiple processes.

    Thanks.

    -Zhanping

Test recording and animations are totally different things. However,
if all you want to do perform a sequence of actions for your demo,
then you may use the test playback functionality.

Hey Olumide,

If you're writing your data yourself and you already have texture coordinates calculated, then you shouldn't have to use my script at all -- you can just write the texture coordinates into your file and they will be loaded and ready to use when you open your vtp file. The script was useful in the case where someone was loading their data as comma-separated values and so the texture coordinate vector components were being seen by PV as individual scalar attribute arrays.

If you make that sphere in PV and run the Texture Map to Sphere filter, you can Save Data from PV and look at both the vtp and vtk format outputs. Texture coordinates will show up as two-component Point Data vectors in both formats, and there is an indicator that this vector, whatever you name it, is being used as the "official" texture coordinates for that polydata.

So, write your TCoords out properly in your files, forget the script, and enjoy! :)

Talk to you later,
-Eric

Christian,

O-oh! We can't have our users going mad now can we :). Guess we are
looking at this the wrong way, instead of working from the solution,
let's start with the problem/use-case. Can you describe your use-case
as simply as possibly. What's the goal here? What is the user doing?

Hey Christian,

I'm definitely not an expert in this, but just so you know, there are some ways of getting information about your data set automatically to fill default values in the auto-generated GUI panels. 

All of this is covered in Ch 18.6, Server Manager XML, in the ParaView Guide, and you can search through the XML files used in ParaView in [PVsrc]/Servers/ServerManager/Resources/filters.xml for things like BoundsDomain and ExtentsDomain for examples. There are also various "InformationHelper" types, too.

Talk to you later,
-Eric

I wanted to have the vtkImageClip functionality available in Paraview and performed the same steps as always to get a Paraview-Plugin out of a VTK Filter. I compiled the plugin, called it ImageClip and copied it over to my Paraview Plugin directory. Then I started Paraview. When browsing through my custom "Extensions" Filters-entry, I found that there is no ImageClip but a Crop! And this crop provided me with a nice GUI, letting me change the output size with spinbuttons and already providing the maximum x/y/z extents! Wow! It was like if Paraview said "Ah, I know that vtk Filter and I happen to know which parameters it likes and how to preset its values. You surely won't mind if I ignore your ServerManager xml and do all by myself, do you?"

Subject: [Paraview] Display given node IDs from Ensight Gold file
In-Reply-To: <o2gf8d97d9d1004200734sf87ee879t9a4d25021157878f@mail.gmail.com>
Message-ID: <5631DC7A395F4B33BD1DCFBE00FC1E08@LIMPCMGC>

Zhanping:

I send attached a minimal Ensight Gold dataset in ASCII format:

- case file.
- geometry file.

- snapshot of the result I get.
- state file after capturing the snapshot.

As you can see in the snapshot, the problem is that Paraview displays "0"
and "1" as node labels, instead of the original node IDs given in the
geometry file ("13" and "22").

This can be a problem for Ensight multi-part datasets where node IDs are
given to avoid duplicated IDs (for example: part1 has node IDs from 1 to
100, part2 from 101 to 200, ...). 

Thanks
Manuel Gonzalez

It appears that Fedora 14 will have 4.7,  so if I'm to build a paraview 
package for Fedora 14 it will have compile at least.  Fedora 14 won't be 
out till around November though, so there is time.

It sounds like some us should start work with 4.7 day to day. It may
be a good idea to have a dashboard or two testing with 4.7 in a month
or two. We are focusing on the release right now so it won't happen
right away.

Hi Utkarsh,

The patch works partially. Both sequential and parallel builds are
possible now, but only when not compiling against Mesa (and using
VTK_USE_RPATH:BOOL=OFF).
If one does, creating the help file fails, even though the mesa lib
directory is part of my LD_LIBRARY_PATH:

That's good news :). At least the dependency issue is solved. Dave
will shortly commit a fix for not over-ridding the LD_LIBRARY_PATH
when running SMExtractDocumentation.

It's checked in now. Give it a try and let me know. I am currently waiting
for my own Linux build to finish rebuilding.

Manuel:

    Now I understand your question. This question was raised before by
another user. It involves the choice of storing the points either on a
global basis (based on the whole multi-block datatset) or on a local
(per-block) basis (the one currently adopted by VTK for
vtkMultiBlockDataSet). The latter scheme is scalable for maintaining large
datasets and is flexible in that individual blocks may be conveniently
extracted from the original multiblock dataset.

   Thanks.

Manuel:

    If you go to the very beginning (the first paragraph) of page 483 of the
EnSight manual (
http://vis.lbl.gov/NERSC/Software/ensight/docs82/UserManual.pdf), you will
find out that the EnSight Gold format (unlike EnSight6) adopts the
block-based point indexing scheme as VTK employs.

Dave,

here's the commit fixing the dependency issue. Should go in the 3.8
branch as well:

Actually, looks like a case issue - QShortCut vs QShortcut

Erm ... it appears I spoke in haste ...

The some of the vertices of the objects I'm trying to texture have more 
than one texture coordinates. For example, refer to the right part of 
the screenshot (not mine): http://tinyurl.com/y3sqtbt

You will see that vertices in the midline of the face gave two texture 
coordinates, while most of the others have just one.

As such a per-face texture mapping will be required. And, from what I 
see of the example written out by Paraview, the one-vertex one-texture 
coordinate approach will not work in this case.

What do you advise?

Thanks,

Thanks Alan.

Just to be absolutely sure I'm understood, I'm referring to the ability 
to export screenshots and and animations at fullscreen resolutions.

I'm aware that Paraview 3.8 (RC1) has a fullscreen feature. The problem 
is that its not possible to export screenshots and animations at that 
resolution.

Thanks.

Hi Luca,

I don't think you compiled with debug information as you are not
getting the file and line information (did you set the build type to
debug?).  This way you could post details of the line in
CreateUnstructuredGridOutput.  You could also go to that frame and
list the local variables, e.g.

frame 8
info locals

Zhamping: I have never used the format and don't know enough to see
what is wrong here other than numElements is used quite a bit for for
the operator new[] and also for seeking in the file.  Sometimes this
value is multiplied by a constant first - could it be that this should
be of type long?  (note: need more than a substitution at the top as
it is passed to functions that require an int, e.g. ReadInt)

Regards,
Paul

I'm using Paraview in order to visualize the flow in a turbomachinery row. I
work with several mesh, and I want to compare the results they provide
between each other.
To do this, I extract a 3D surface of the first mesh, k=0 for example, and I
would like to interpolate the data of the second mesh onto this 3D surface.
Is it possible with Paraview ?

An other subsidiary question : how can we change the coordinate ? For
example (x, y, z) ---> (x ,r , theta)

Thanks for help.

Utkarsh

I am a new user to Paraview - and therefore do not know what to do
when you say to apply the transform filter. I therefore searched the
web for more information on how to apply the transform filter in
Paraview. The best I could find was here :
http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2009-March/011560.html  - I
was able to use that answer to apply the scale that I need.

I have also applied the Delaunay filter - and now have a 3d surface
chart that I wanted!

What do I need to do to see the coordinates of the cursor as I move it
over the surface chart? I need to see the values of the local maximum.

Regards

Chris

I don't think this is currently possible.  Could someone give me any

Thanks in advance,

Message-ID: <k2j167496f31004210506mc59c058cn46a34660cf95b79b@mail.gmail.com>

Hello.

I am new to Linux, but I need to do some scientific visualisation.

I Installed "Ubuntu 9.10 - Karmic Koala". Then I used Synaptic package
manager to install "Paraview 3.4.0-4ubuntu4".
When I press file->open in the main menu, I getting this window:
http://i060.radikal.ru/1004/b6/6bd2db108af4.png
So, you see, that there is mojibake instead of Russian filenames.

I cannot start using Paraview because I cannot get to my files.

Please help.

P.S. These folder names are displayed correctly in all other places except
Paraview.

Hi all,

It does not work with that. I just want to insert a parameter 
(-share-intel) in the  cmake configuration.
An idea ?

Thank.

Message-ID: <s2k167496f31004210550m1a9fa34g4733b2a348689d18@mail.gmail.com>

Hello.

I am new to Linux, but I need to do some scientific visualisation.

I Installed "Ubuntu 9.10 - Karmic Koala". Then I used Synaptic package
manager to install "Paraview 3.4.0-4ubuntu4".
Then I downloaded example files from here:
http://www.psc.edu/general/software/packages/paraview/tutorial/pvt.php?s=6

I run Paraview, open example file. It looks like that:
http://i061.radikal.ru/1004/27/9c5062113e84.png
Then I make box clip (inside-out):
http://s51.radikal.ru/i132/1004/be/94fe377a6ab9.png
Then I rotate it by mouse:
http://s40.radikal.ru/i090/1004/e9/17f98da623f3.png
Then I decided not to rotate. So, I press Crtl+z. Instead of undo,
application immediately closing (crash?)

I have repeated this several times.
Please fix.

Message-ID: <4BCEF5DC.3080407@rwth-aachen.de>

Hi!

I made a new topic about that selection thing. Here is my use-case:

Overview: We have volumetric data of metal components. These components 
contain unwanted defects (holes that appear during the casting process). 
These holes are visible as dark regions (objects) in the data. 
Unfortunately, there are other structures in the metal that are also 
dark (graphite). After a few image processing steps many of those 
objects (defects and graphite) are segmented out of the originial volume 
data. A contouring (and connectivity filtering) yields a nice 
visualization of those objects.

Use Case: Select defects
Goal: The user selects the defects out of the many presented objects.

Details: Due to the extremely cool features of Paraview, the user is 
able to mix the views of all extracted objects and the original volume 
data (see image) to easily verify which object is a defect and which one 
is graphite. When the user identifies an object as a defect, he marks it 
by a simple click. The object will highlight so the user can always see 
which objects have already been selected. When the user is done 
selecting all defects, he clicks on the "Measure Defects" button. A 
database containing all necessary information on the defects (centroid, 
total volume, volume percentage,...) will automatically be created and 
saved in a secret place.

Remark:
The "Measure Defects Button" will call a Python macro that desperately 
tries to extract the selected objects (points). These points are needed 
for correspondance to the original volume data that is actually being 
analyzed (the mean grey value of a defect and such are important 
quantities). Certainly, one single point per object suffices for this 
correspondance.


Best regards,
Christian

Hey Chris,

Yes, you are on the right track with that mailing list entry. If you want to actually transform the values of the points, just go to Filters->Transform and then enter a factor between 0 and 1 in the appropriate Scale box (e.g. 0.2 in the third Scale column will multiply the Z values by 0.2). If you want to keep the original data values, but just scale the display, then go to the Display tab in the Object Inspector and all the way down at the bottom is a Transformation section where you can do the same sort of Scale entry.

ParaView doesn't support hovering labels right now, but you can tell it to label selected points. Use one of the point selection tools to select some points on your grid. Then, go to View->Selection Inspector. At the bottom of that panel there is a Display Style section. If you hit the Point Label tab and check the Visible box you'll see PointID and other attributes in the Label Mode combo-box. If your point coordinates are not there, then you can apply the Calculator filter to your data: Attribute Mode: Point Data, Result Array Name: Coordinates (or something like that), Equation (next box down): coords (which you can get by pulling down on the Vectors button on the lower right. After you hit apply the coordinates of your points will be an explicit vector attribute of your point data, and this new vector should show up in the Label Mode combo box for Point Label.

Talk to you later,
-Eric

Hey Olumide,

Well, you may be getting out of my shallow understanding of texturing polygons... Is it only the vertices at the interfaces between those surfaces that have multiple texture coordinates? Am I understanding correctly from the image that you have a single texture that gets mapped to the entire structure as shown on black-background right-hand side of the image?

When you export your model, is it possible to export each of those six pieces which I see disconnected on the right as a separate entity? If you can, then you can represent the entire geometry as a "multi-block" data set, which is kind of like a bunch of grouped pieces, each of them in this case being a polydata mesh. Then, each of these six pieces can have it's own set of texture coordinates and it doesn't matter if they spatially overlap at the interfaces. Then, when you apply the texture to the multi-block data, it will get mapped correctly onto each of the parts.

(You can see what I mean by creating a Sphere Source and applying Texture Map to Sphere. Then create a Plane source and Texture Map to Plane. Then, highlight both texture map filters in the pipeline browser and do Group Datasets. Now when you apply a texture to that grouped "multi-block" data set it all gets distributed correctly even if they overlap strangely.)

As I said, though, you may be getting out of my depth with the topic. :)
-Eric

You can already specify the resolution explicitly when saving
screenshots as well as exporting animation movies. Doesn't simply
specifying the same resolution as your monitor do the same thing?

If you aren't in full screen mode won't you then be exposed to the
tiling bugs with volume rendering and wireframes that happen when the
output image is larger than the render window? Or have these been
cleared up?

Dear all,
I have two CVS files with ~500000 3d point with a scalar value.
I load them in paraview then I use Table To points to have a polygonal
mesh.

I then use the resample with dataset so that in the next step I can do a
with the a programmable filter.

The problem I have is that looking at the vtkValidPointMask after I run the
probe filter I have almost ~400000 points which are set to 0 (aka they are
invalid).

Why is that? How can I reduce that number?

My two data set are the results of a very dense point sample taken on the
same boundary surface.

Sincerely,
Luca

The probe filter assigns the invalid flag when a sample location isn't
located within any cell in the field (as happens in parallel cases
when a processor is sampling outside of its local domain).

What data type are you sampling within exactly? If the cells are 2D or
less, it is pretty easy to have lots of the sample locations not
satisfy the plane equations of any of the 2D cells.

HI Eric,

What you see in the image http://tinyurl.com/y3sqtbt are the faces of 
the model in UV space. The image is therefore an explicit specification 
of texture coordinates on a per-face basis. That is to say, the 
representation allows texture coordinates to independently specified for 
each face. And as a result, seams appear in the UV space representation 
whenever a vertex has more than 1 texture coordinate e.g. a diffuerent 
texture coordinate for each face or group of faces.

CGI artists refer to this process of creating this representation as 
UV-unwrapping. See:
http://www.blender.org/development/release-logs/blender-234/uv-unwrapping/

But I see what you mean. It is possible to export each UV patch of my 
model as a different sub-object, where each vertex of the sub-object has 
one texture coordinate.

Back on track ...

Thanks,

- Olumide

Hey Paul,

If it's something you want to attempt yourself, you can grep for
ChartTitleFont in rendering.xml to see how the title font property works.
Then open vtkSMXYChartViewProxy.cxx and look at the implementation of
SetTitleFont.  This is where the proxy calls the VTK chart api to set the
title font.  I'm not sure what the vtk api for setting legend font is...

Good point. We should definitely fix those tiling issues soon in any case.

Are you sure that the paraview window has the focus and not the
terminal from which you launched paraview?

Dear David,
I have two data sets with 3d points and a scalar value coming from two CSV 
files and then I filter them through Table to Points, and then I apply the 
resample data set filter.

So basically the two inputs are Poligonal Mesh, see the attached pic.

Sincerely,
Luca

Yes, you can use the "Resample With Dataset" filter. This filter has two inputs:
"Input" -- the dataset that you will provide the values being
interpolated i.e. your "second mesh"
"Source" -- the dataset onto which the values are interpolated i.e.
your 3D surface.

Subject: [Paraview] Problems with 'change_coords_only' in Ensight Gold
	dataset
Message-ID: <5F58DD24953D4C0DB99B2C13ADB7AAAF@LIMPCMGC>

I use Paraview to display datasets with changing geometry over time, but
constant connectivity.

The datasets are generated in Ensight Gold format by my own code.

I would like to reduce the dataset size by using the 'change_coords_only'
option in the Ensight Gold case file, so I can define the connectivity only
in the geometry file for the initial timestep.

But it seems that Paraview still requires the (non changing) connectivity in
the geometry file for each timestep even when 'change_coords_only' is
present, otherwise the number of cells is 0 except for the first time step.

Does anybody have a working example of 'change_coords_only' which only
provides the connectivity in the first timestep?

Best regards,
Manuel

Message-ID: <z2p395712631004211034y5a1a6764p329cf65c62264d11@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everybody,

Second question of this day.....
I'm using Paraview in order to analyse the flow in a compressor stage.
So I'm using MultiBlockDataSet, composed of several StructuredGrid. Some
turn, other don't.

In order to calculate some variables, as the absolute mach number for
example, I need to use the rotationnal speed, that depends of the number of
the Block in the MultiBlockDataSet. For example, block number 1 to 5 belong
to the row that turn, 6 to 12 to the row that is static.
One solution to define the rotationnal speed would be to store its value on
each point of each StructuredGrid, but it would use a lot of memory....

Do you know a better way to handle this ?

Regards,

A.MARSAN

Manuel:

    Currently the VTK EnSight reader does not support this functionality.

    BTW: I do not know if you are reducing the size of the dataset for the
initial parallel problem. If it is true and if that problem occurs upon
loading the first time step, you may simply change the number of time steps
to 1 in the case files.

Christian,

Attached is simple python script (that you can encapsulate as a macro)
to which you can add code to processes the extract points however you
like. I am simply writing them out to a file.

To use this script, do the following (to keep it simple I am using the
Sphere source as an example, no reason why it won't work with your
data).
1> Create Sphere source
2> Create a selection of points or cells
3> Open Python Shell and run the attached script.

As as result, you'll have a mygrid.vtu file written out with the
extracted points(or cells). No 3 seconds waits, no errors writing
files, no need for the user to create extract selection filter.

Using the python macros capability, you can make this script a
trigger-able from a toolbutton.

Couple of options:
* store the value in an array in the FieldData for the StructuredGrid
for each block. Then your filter can get the rotational speed from the
field data.
* store the value in the MetaData associated with each block in the
MultiBlockDataSet. The issue with meta-data is that it's not
communicated accross processes correctly, nor is it written out in
files (or read from files) by the standard readers/writers.

Also, if you are running ParaView 3.4.0, try a newer version - such as the release candidates on the paraview website.

Are you sure that the paraview window has the focus and not the
terminal from which you launched paraview?

This issue has been fixed in git. Commit details as under. BTW, undo
can only be used to undo accepted changes, in your case since you
hadn't applyed the rotation to the box, you can simply use "Reset".

------------------------------
commit b401319a9a927fcc4294a56513ee697985c959e8
Author: Utkarsh Ayachit <utkarsh.ayachit at kitware.com>
Date:   Wed Apr 21 14:41:05 2010 -0400

    Fixed segfault when undoing clip with box.

    Create a clip filter, choose clip-type==box, apply and then undo. ParaView w
    segfault since the default Bounds for the vtkBox proxy were empty which
    resulted in PlaceWidget being called with 0 arguments. Fixed that.

No. Every  vtkStructuredGrid has 3 types of attributes:
* PointData -- for each point
* CellData -- for each cell
* FieldData -- not associated with any thing. Just an arbitrary
collection of attributes.

FieldData can be accessed using vtkDataObject::GetFieldData() API.
You can add an vtkDoubleArray with name (say  RotationalSpeed) with a
single tuple which is the speed for that block to this FieldData. Most
filters simply pass through the field data, so it should be propagated
from the reader through any intermediate filters to your filter which
is actually making use of the rotational speed.

I'm sorry.  I'm confused about what you are announcing.  Are you saying that you have a version of ParaView using the Wii controller for navigation?  That you have an application build on ParaView libraries using the Wii controller?  That you have some application that could be used as an example for other ParaView developers?

Glad it works.

What do you mean by "a pick selects all cells with same ID" ? Is ID a
cell array? If so, you can already do so using the  Edit | "Find Data"
dialog
 [ http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Find_Data_using_Queries ]

Subject: [Paraview] Python scripts with PyQt4
In-Reply-To: <x2t45d654b1004171039pc742f465ubca3a388f3ce392f@mail.gmail.com>

PyQt can be made to work with paraview.  Make sure paraview and pyqt use the
same version of qt.  It works for me using qt 4.6.2 compiled from source,
and system pyqt (apt-get install python-qt4.)  Don't create a QApplication
or call exec_(), paraview already has an application event loop running.  A
minimal example would look like:


from PyQt4 import QtGui
b = QtGui.QPushButton("click me")
b.show()


But... due to the way paraview embeds python you can't use pyqt signal/slot
callbacks without some hackery.  Paraview creates multiple python
interpreter contexts, so callbacks don't automatically execute under the
correct context.  The issue is described here:
http://www.vtk.org/pipermail/vtk-developers/2009-June/006091.html

You can work around the issue by wrapping python functions that are called
via qt signals with @callback_wrapper.  Here is a minimal example that shows
a combo box, changing selection in the combo box creates objects in
paraview:

def callback_wrapper(func):
    """A decorator that wraps a python function with a vtk callback"""
    v = paraview.vtk.vtkObject()
    def wrap(*args, **kwargs):
        v._args = args
        v._kwargs = kwargs
        v.Modified()
    def callback(o, e): func(*v._args, **v._kwargs)
    v.AddObserver("ModifiedEvent", callback)
    return wrap


@callback_wrapper
def onComboChanged(value):
    print "You selected:", value
    if value == "Sphere": Sphere()
    if value == "Cone": Cone()
    if value == "Cylinder": Cylinder()

from PyQt4 import QtCore, QtGui
c = QtGui.QComboBox()
for s in ["Sphere", "Cone", "Cylinder"]: c.addItem(s)
c.connect(c, QtCore.SIGNAL('currentIndexChanged(const QString&)'),
onComboChanged)
c.show()



One final disclaimer: if errors occur while executing pyqt code, paraview
can hang instead of reporting the error message and returning...

Hi Ayachit ,
Sorry for the deferred reply. When the Remote Render Threshold is set to 0,
the wavelet source is still not composited correctly.

Yep, I know the Find Data and it's quite nice to have. I mean something 
still more simple. In my use case i wrote:

"...The object will highlight so the user can always see which objects
have already been selected..."


which could be realized with some kind of "RegionID" selector. So one 
click and -BAM- all points with same ID selected.

Best regards,
Christian

Message-ID: <F9512B0A-98CB-45CC-9A1E-CB109B7F63BE@ec-nantes.fr>

Hi,

I'm writing xdmf file to export my data (from matlab). I have a  
transient multi domain solution. A simple example (2 time-steps X 2- 
domains) file is attached. Note: the topology and the geometry are  
written only once).

The "Rescale to data range" button (GUI interface), rescale always to  
the first time-step. even if I'm looking to the second timestep.

The Object Inspector, (Data Arrays) shows the right Data Ranges.

using ParaView 3.8.0-RC1

thanks

Felipe

Hello,

I found that some help file are missing in the OnLine help of PV 3.8.0 
RC1 Windows distribution
- ParaViewSources.html
- ParaViewFilters.html
- ParaViewReaders.html
- ParaViewWriters.html
All these help files are in the Linux distribution. Could you fix that 
for the final 3.8.0 release?

Best regards.

You've got to add the directory where this (and other so-files)

The problem with implementing such a component in ParaView is the fact
that there's no universal notion of "RegionID". However  it's may not
be difficult to add a tool button plugin that uses the some code
similar to FindData to create RegionID based selections for your
application.

Sorry, my bad ( I can never remember which setting applies where). Go
to Edit |Settings. Then, on the Server page in the "Tile Display
Parameters" group, set Compositing Threshold to 0 (and ensure that
it's enabled). This is the setting that controls tile-display
compositing.

Subject: [Paraview] Programmable Source & MultiBlockDataSet
Message-ID: <j2m395712631004220636sb2c12b8by31a07d7015f8c3c9@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

A new thing I don't know how to do with Paraview.
I have written a personnal reader, that creates vtkStructuredGrid from files
written in so called format "v3d". So I'm able to construct a
MutliBlockDataSet, that is composed of all the Blocks I'm working with.

I would like to use "Programmable Source", so we don't need to write the
file on the disk before to open it with Paraview.
Does "Programmable Source" work with MultiBlockDataSet ? I don't see this
class in the Output Data Set Type that we can choose...

And is it correct if I write in the Script of the Programmable Filter :

from perso import *
multiblock = MultiBlockDataSetFromV3D(.....)
self.GetOutput().DeepCopy(multiblock)

Thanks for help.

Subject: [Paraview]  3.8 RC1 regression in line chart ?
Message-ID: <4BD0562E.30001@onera.fr>

Hello, here is me again.

I have found some kind of regression with the line charts (XY plots) in 
PV 3.8 RC1:
First, loading a very simple csv file with three columns (named P, R and 
T), then using filter "PlotData":

1. the XY windows comes with the top "VARIABLE" box unchecked and all my 
variables (P, V, T) boxes checked in the Line Series panel of the 
Display tab, but the XY window remains empty until I check the top 
"VARIABLE" box. The default X axis is the Row ID. OK.

2. Now I want to use one of my three data arrays as the X axis: I select 
the radio-button and the first variable P is selected by default on the 
list-box. OK, this is the variable I want on the X axis, but I get many 
error messages because "No X column is set (index 0)". I have to select 
another X axis variable, then to come again on the P variable. No more 
error, but the X axis remains scaled with the Row ID values! I have to 
uncheck a variable in the line series panel and to check it again to 
obtain the correct P values on the X axis. Finally I get my three curves 
and I can change the X axis variable as I want.

3. All variables are scaled by default with the bottom-left axis system 
and I want to scale one of the variables on the right axis. I select one 
variable in the Line series panel and I try to change the default 
bottom-left Chart Axes for bottom-right or top-right axis system. 
Nothing happens: the top and right axis don't appear and all variables 
remain scaled on the bottom-left axis system. I can change some 
attributes of the variable (Line thickness, Line Style, Marker), but not 
the Chart Axes, although it was possible to change the Chart Axes with 
PV 3.6.2.

I attach the very small csv file that I used for my tests.

Regards.

Richard

Eric

Please know that I really appreciate the time you took to answer my
query. I have done what you have suggested - and it brought me closer
to what I want. Unfortunately it still does not do exactly what I
want. I am at the point of accepting that Paraview is not what I need
because:
1) When I transform the data so that the scales of the surface chart
appears in proportion the actual data is transformed - I want to
adjust the scales of the axis only - not the data because when I
select the data I then have to divide the result again by the scale
factor to know whet the actual values are.
2) It seem the Delaunay 2d filter seems to decrease the resolution of
my data by drawing triangles only between major points. The ideal for
me would be to not have any data manipulation at all - Paraview seems
to be too powerful.
3) Learning how to do things is not easy - I would prefer a chat board
/ bulletin board over an email list - to see if other people has tried
the same as what I am trying. There is nothing new under the sun.

Regards

Chris

If you want to actually transform the values of the points, just go to Filters->Transform and then enter a factor between 0 and 1 in the appropriate Scale box (e.g. 0.2 in the third Scale column will multiply the Z values by 0.2). If you want to keep the original data values, but just scale the display, then go to the Display tab in the Object Inspector and all the way down at the bottom is a Transformation section where you can do the same sort of Scale entry.

Then, go to View->Selection Inspector. At the bottom of that panel there is a Display Style section. If you hit the Point Label tab and check the Visible box you'll see PointID and other attributes in the Label Mode combo-box. If your point coordinates are not there, then you can apply the Calculator filter to your data: Attribute Mode: Point Data, Result Array Name: Coordinates (or something like that), Equation (next box down): coords (which you can get by pulling down on the Vectors button on the lower right. After you hit apply the coordinates of your points will be an explicit vector attribute of your point data, and this new vector should show up in the Label Mode combo box for Point Label.

Hey Chris,

1.) That is the point of the transformation which is in the Display tab -- it doesn't actually transform the data, only the display (the Transform Filter actually changes the data). So, with that Display transform the visual representation looks different but the data values are still the original.

2.) That seems strange. I thought it should use all points, but I'm definitely not an expert on Delaunay2D. How does it seem to determine "major points"?

3.) Sorry it's not working out for you. ParaView is definitely not always the most intuitive tool for beginners, but feel free to pass things by us in the future if you want to try again.

Good luck,
-Eric

If you want to actually transform the values of the points, just go to Filters->Transform and then enter a factor between 0 and 1 in the appropriate Scale box (e.g. 0.2 in the third Scale column will multiply the Z values by 0.2). If you want to keep the original data values, but just scale the display, then go to the Display tab in the Object Inspector and all the way down at the bottom is a Transformation section where you can do the same sort of Scale entry.

Then, go to View->Selection Inspector. At the bottom of that panel there is a Display Style section. If you hit the Point Label tab and check the Visible box you'll see PointID and other attributes in the Label Mode combo-box. If your point coordinates are not there, then you can apply the Calculator filter to your data: Attribute Mode: Point Data, Result Array Name: Coordinates (or something like that), Equation (next box down): coords (which you can get by pulling down on the Vectors button on the lower right. After you hit apply the coordinates of your points will be an explicit vector attribute of your point data, and this new vector should show up in the Label Mode combo box for Point Label.

Subject: [Paraview] Time dependant field in Ensight Gold Format
Message-ID: <p2m4a80b5f61004220922z7e8d13dax126d018b65c95739@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

with Thomas Pedot, we've compiled paraview on mac os x snow leopard
(10.6) from paraview cvs head checked out today (3.9.0). The problem
is still here, however, we are able to visualize the transient data,
provided the time values of the ensight case file are changed from
doubles to integers.

It seems that doubles are converted to integers since using the 4
following time values in the ensight case :
1.1
1.3
2.1
2.3

will result into only 2 snapshots in paraview, with time=1 and time=2.

I attached the test case, since it is very small.

Best regards,
Anthony Ruiz

Hi Anthony:

   What do you mean by "the time values of the ensight case file are changed
from
doubles to integers" and "1.1 1.3 2.1 2.3"? Can you explain more about your
changes to the original case file?

Hi,
paraview reads double as integer
1.1 is read as 1
1.3 as 1
2.1 as 2
2.3 as 2

So only 2 time dependant files are accessible.

loading data.

My system: Intel Xeon(R) CPU @ 2.66GHz; 3G RAM; WXP Service Pack 3.

Richard,
1) This seems to work fine on the trunk from a few days ago.
2) This seems to work fine on the trunk from a few days ago.
3) Good catch - this is a bug.  I wrote up a bug report, bug number 10597.

Subject: [Paraview] 3.8 RC1 regression in line chart ?

Hello, here is me again.

I have found some kind of regression with the line charts (XY plots) in PV 3.8 RC1:
First, loading a very simple csv file with three columns (named P, R and T), then using filter "PlotData":

1. the XY windows comes with the top "VARIABLE" box unchecked and all my variables (P, V, T) boxes checked in the Line Series panel of the Display tab, but the XY window remains empty until I check the top "VARIABLE" box. The default X axis is the Row ID. OK.

2. Now I want to use one of my three data arrays as the X axis: I select the radio-button and the first variable P is selected by default on the list-box. OK, this is the variable I want on the X axis, but I get many error messages because "No X column is set (index 0)". I have to select another X axis variable, then to come again on the P variable. No more error, but the X axis remains scaled with the Row ID values! I have to uncheck a variable in the line series panel and to check it again to obtain the correct P values on the X axis. Finally I get my three curves and I can change the X axis variable as I want.

3. All variables are scaled by default with the bottom-left axis system and I want to scale one of the variables on the right axis. I select one variable in the Line series panel and I try to change the default bottom-left Chart Axes for bottom-right or top-right axis system. 
Nothing happens: the top and right axis don't appear and all variables remain scaled on the bottom-left axis system. I can change some attributes of the variable (Line thickness, Line Style, Marker), but not the Chart Axes, although it was possible to change the Chart Axes with PV 3.6.2.

I attach the very small csv file that I used for my tests.

Regards.

Richard

The location we're looking at is the interface between two fluids so there
may be a discontinuity in the tangential derivatives for that reason.  I'm
trying to write my own derivative and interpolation filters in a python
programmable filter which will take  one-sided derivatives and use one-sided
interpolation.  In order to do this I need to use cell data in my filter and
not point data to avoid the interpolation that takes place.  Typically I
access point data with something like:

input = self.GetInputDataObject(0, 0)
> output = self.GetOutputDataObject(0)
>
> inputBlock = input.GetBlock(0)
> # copy old data
> output.CopyStructure(input)
> outputBlock = inputBlock.NewInstance()
> outputBlock.UnRegister(None)
> outputBlock.CopyStructure(inputBlock)
> output.SetBlock(0,outputBlock)
>
> # get number of points
> numPts = input.GetNumberOfPoints()
> # temperature gradient
> GtArr = input.GetPointData().GetVectors('ScalarGradient')
>

However, there doesn't seem to be an equivalent 'GetNumberOfCells()' or
'GetCellData()' for my multiblock data.  How can I access the cell data?

Thanks for your help,

Peter.

Message-ID: <p2wc19fcadc1004221417p6ed6b65cw37ba91115c7ec721@mail.gmail.com>

If you make a source (I tested with a cone source), split the view to
show a spreadsheet view, and select a point on the cone, nothing shows
up in the spreadsheet view. In fact, under Attribute the only option
is FieldData. If you do something so that the points get PointData
(e.g. GenerateSurfaceNormals), you can then select a point and see the
normal, coordinate, and point ID of the selected point. Is there a
reason for this behavior? Or could it be changed so that the
coordinate and ID could be seen even if the object doesn't have any
PointData?

Thanks,

David

Message-ID: <u2jc19fcadc1004221430v40897539h8835dd1a87cb66c1@mail.gmail.com>

I have a VTK class that takes two inputs:

int vtkRestorePolyDataPointIds::FillInputPortInformation(
                                            int port, vtkInformation* info)
{
  if ( port == 0 ) //this is the polydata we want to correct
    {
    info->Set(vtkDataObject::DATA_TYPE_NAME(), "vtkPolyData" );
    return 1;
    }
  else if(port == 1) //this is the object we want to use to match the ids to
    {
    info->Set(vtkDataObject::DATA_TYPE_NAME(), "vtkPointSet" );
    return 1;
    }

  return 0; //invalid port requested
}

So I made two InputProperty entires in the xml:

<!--input-->
      <InputProperty
         name="Input"
         port_index="0"
         command="SetInputConnection">
        <ProxyGroupDomain name="groups">
          <Group name="sources"/>
          <Group name="filters"/>
        </ProxyGroupDomain>

        <DataTypeDomain name="input_type">
          <DataType value="vtkPolyData"/>
        </DataTypeDomain>
        <Documentation>
          Set the input point set.
        </Documentation>
      </InputProperty>

<!--target ids-->
      <InputProperty
         name="TargetIds"
         port_index="1"
         command="SetInputConnection">
        <ProxyGroupDomain name="groups">
          <Group name="sources"/>
          <Group name="filters"/>
        </ProxyGroupDomain>

        <DataTypeDomain name="input_type">
          <DataType value="vtkPointSet"/>
        </DataTypeDomain>
        <Documentation>
          Set the target point set.
        </Documentation>
      </InputProperty>

However, if I create two sources ( a box and a cone), select one,
ctrl+click the other one, then go to the filters list, it is greyed
out. Can anyone see a problem with the above?

Thanks,

David

Filters have different ways of specifying inputs: you can have
multiple input connections on an input port, and/or you can have
multiple input ports.
Your filter is a multi-input port filter which accepts a single
connection on each of the 2 ports. If user selects, multiple sources
in the pipeline browser, ParaView assumes multiple connections on an
input port, thus enabling only those filters that have the "Input"
property such that it accepts multiple connections (like the Append
filter, Group Datasets filter etc.).

For multiple input ports, ParaView convention is that you simply
select the value for one input port; ParaView will popup a input
selection dialog to allow user to explicitly specify the sources for
the other input ports.

Please add that to the bug tracker.

It is a known limitation that I thought we were going to fix but it
apparently slipped through the cracks.

The workaround (which is an unfortunate one) is to use the calculator
to add an array.

You have to get the leaf nodes of the multi-block dataset first. In
this case, I suspect inputBlock will be a leaf block.

Fantastic!  "InputBlock" is a leaf block as suspected.

Message-ID: <4BD0FA08.3000306@web.de>

I would like to create an animation in which the camera literally 
inspects various parts my model/scene. The sort of camera paths I need 
to specify are hard to manually describe as an animation curve (even 
very simple camera paths are hard to manually describe as animation 
curves).

Is it possible to manually move the camera to various locations, and set 
a keyframe at each location as is the practice in 3d applications? This 
would be a _lot_ simpler than specifying animation curves by hand.

Thanks,

Yes.

That is what the "Interpolate camera locations" track type choice is for.

To use it, set that type for the camera and then add the track. Now
double click on the track to pop up the Animation Keyframes dialog for
the path and then double click on any "Position ..." entry to get to
the camera location dialog. From there click on "use current" to copy
in the current camera value.

Note that although this lets you specify exactly where the camera is
located and pointed at, the interpolation between those points is not
a nice spline so making a nice animation with it is often not as easy
as it sounds.

I think, what we really need is a way to make the "use current" button
apply to nodes in the follow path or orbit modes. There might be a way
to do that that I am not aware of. If not please file a feature
request.

Thanks. I've experimented with keyframes dialog. And you are right: the 
animation curve isn't nearly as nice as I'd expected.

The standard solution to camera control in 3d software is to give the 
user access to the animation curves created by setting keyframes, so 
that the user than can set or correct the tangent/tension at the keyframes.

Orbits are nice but they are very limited. Paths too are nice but they 
are extremely difficult to create define "by hand". I'd vote for 
animation curves.

Hello Dave.

No I don't use Git nor CVS. I use only the 3.8 RC1 binaries released on 
the Paraview download page because I cannot install Qt, Cmake and all 
the stuff needed to compile from source on my office workstation (I am 
not the administrator). I downloaded the binaries on April 16th.
Maybe I will try later to compile on my home Windows laptop with 
MSYS/MinGW. For the moment, I am learning Qt and Cmake.

Subject: [Paraview] Create a plugin

If you want to add a plugin (an existing VTK Filter) into Paraview, you 
can start here:

http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Plugin_HowTo

If you are planning to implement your own data manipulation, you'll have 
to learn how to write VTK Filters and understand the mechanics of VTK, 
especially its pipeline design:

 www.cmake.org/Wiki/images/8/80/Pipeline.pdf
http://www.cmake.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/Utilities/Upgrading/TheNewVTKPipeline.pdf?rev=1.5


The next step would be to look into example code or some of the simple 
filters. You might also want to buy the VTK User's Guide, if you are 
planning to really get into this topic. In such a filter you can of 
course do what ever you need.
After all, if you just want to execute some existing program out of 
Paraview, you might as well do this from the Python shell:

import subprocess

subprocess.call(['myProgram'])


Which you can save as a macro and make it accessible through a nifty button.


Best regards,
Christian

Zhanping :

I downloaded again the mac binaries today, and it is know working ...
I don't know what happened.

Regarding the paraview I built from sources, I guess the problem comes
from conflicts between gcc 4.2.1 (apple version) python 2.6.4 (apple
version, built with gcc 4.0.1) and qt 4.5.3.

Are there any requirements regarding the versions of the above programs ?

Maybe I have found a way to avoid the Programmable Source...

But Is it possible to export an object created in the python shell directly
into the pipeline of the paraview interface ?

Hello,

I use a personnal reader that creates a vtk.vtkStructuredGrid.
I realize the programmable source, with this script :


> import PersoModule
> self.GetOutput().DeepCopy(PersoModule.Read(.........))
>

If at first, I choose Output Data Type as PolyData, click on Apply, and then
choose Output Data Type as StructuredGrid and click on "Apply" again, it
works.

But if I choose Output Data Type = StructuredGrid directly, nothing appears,
and the Output is empty.

Do i do something wrong ?

I found a solution to do what I wanted to do. Not really elegant, but it
works.
The best would be to encode the reader in the source code.... but I don't
know how to do, and have no time for now.

First, I use the tool Source -> Data Object Generator, and create a
MultiBlockDataSet.

> MB{}


Then, I use a Programmable Filter, and set the Output Data Type "Same as
Input".
So I can use this script.


> from Moduleperso import *
> m = MultiBlocFromV3D(........)       # This is a personnal reader in
> python, that returns a vtkMultiBlockDataSet
> self.GetOutputDataObject(0).DeepCopy(m)
>

Hope this will help some people who don't want to go in source code...

Message-ID: <93039696-917F-4C01-8FC4-64213AC9A801@mac.com>

Good Morning,

I have been trying unsuccessfully to build the 3.8 RC 1 on OS X because of a problem with ffmpeg. 

Building ffmpeg from the source on the VTK site is unsuccessful if shared libraries are installed. There's a bug in the Makefile somewhere that tries to install a blank library name, and it ends in error.

Building the latest ffmpeg works fine, but the resulting build of ParaView crashes with a segmentation fault when trying to save an animation.

Could you possibly post the build options and ffmpeg version used to generate the 3.8 RC 1 OS X binaries? Thank you.

I attempted the same thing with the x86_64 RC1 binaries and have also
experienced crashes using the latest version of ffmpeg.

The Universal binary are using a very old version of ffmpeg but at least
they work :-/.

You can find that version in a tar.gz here.

http://vtk.org/VTK/resources/software.html#addons

<http://vtk.org/VTK/resources/software.html#addons>Inside the tar.gz is a
ReadMe that tells you what options to build with.

Subject: [Paraview] Which QT for 64-Bit Version for Windows
Message-ID: <4BD1A54D.5080602@rwth-aachen.de>

Hi!

I am about to install the latest Paraview on a 64-Bit Windows System. 
When doing this on a 32-bit Windows I made a bad and painful experience 
when trying to setup everything starting with a self-compiled QT. I 
finally succeeded when I skipped that QT compiling part and used a QT 
binary instead that was compiled for VisualStudio (this is important). 
However, you cannot download a 64Bit binary of QT for Windows in general.

I am shivering in fear when thinking about what will happen if I try to 
do this QT compiling on the 64-Bit System. I see my self doing this all 
over and over without success, as it happened before on the 32Bit 
system. So I wanted to be sure if that 64Bit version of QT is actually 
needed for 64Bit Paraview. Maybe the binary 32Bit suffices already?

If not, does anyone have experience in this? I stopped trying after at 
least 3 differently parameterized compilations of QT turned out to not 
be what Paraview was looking for. If I need to, how would I compile QT 
to make it work with Paraview64 for Visual Studio?


Best regards,
Christian

I usually use a self-built Qt 4.6.2 with ParaView. I have to admit  
that I have not done this in a while though, since maybe ParaView  
3.6.2 days. I don't think I have ever had any problems with a self  
compiled Qt and ParaView on any platform and operating system (Windows  
32 XP, 7 x64, OS X, Linux).

    In order to build a 64 bit ParaView you will need a 64 bit Qt. The  
question is, do you really _need_ a 64 bit ParaView? Just because you  
are running a 64 bit Windows doesn't mean you need to run a 64 bit  
ParaView. You would need a 64 bit ParaView IF you are accessing Data  
sets larger than 2GB or have a HUGE pipeline that will need more than  
the 2GB limit of 32 bit processes**

Hey Christian,

I recently had to compile PV for Windows7 64-bit, and it didn't end up being that bad. 

I used Qt 4.6.2 open source (everywhere). I ran these commands from the 64-bit Visual Studio Pro command prompt (I can't remember if I was running as Administrator) in the Qt source directory:

configure.exe -release -plugin-sql-sqlite
nmake
nmake install

nmake took about 3 hours. (The sqlite plugin was for another project.)

Not sure that the "nmake install" did anything. The last few messages kept were saying something about not being able to do a cyclic copy.

You can tell I'm not an expert in this, but I _did_ work just fine.

When doing this on a 32-bit Windows I made a bad and painful experience when trying to setup everything starting with a self-compiled QT. I finally succeeded when I skipped that QT compiling part and used a QT binary instead that was compiled for VisualStudio (this is important). However, you cannot download a 64Bit binary of QT for Windows in general.

I see my self doing this all over and over without success, as it happened before on the 32Bit system. So I wanted to be sure if that 64Bit version of QT is actually needed for 64Bit Paraview. Maybe the binary 32Bit suffices already?

Sorry I didn't make it clearer in my posting. I tried that version. Actually I tried multiple versions of ffmpeg. 

The ffmpeg_source.tar.gz at  http://vtk.org/VTK/resources/software.html#addons fails to build on OS X 10.5.x and 10.6.x (stopping at bitstream.c with "extended registers have no high values". 

I googled a bit and found a suggestion to get the old ffmpeg revision 6375. That's the one that builds ok but encounters the make install bug.

I do not think so. Fortunately the problem disappeared.
Good luck.

I am afraid my pipeline will get as big as about 10-15GB. We are doing 
analysis on huge volume data and have 32GB of RAM at our disposal. Well, 
I'll just give it a shot and may come back later when encountering some 
explicit problems. I thought maybe there are important compilation 
Parameters one should know to have QT compiled the "right" way. By the 
way, this 1,4GB limit seems to be a good estimate, at least what I am 
experiencing when working with small pieces of our volume data.

Until then, best regards,
Christian

I've just committed a change to ParaView to allow setting output type
to be a multiblock dataset.

Ah, great, thanks. What I just wondered: do I need the whole SDK or just 
the runtime environment? It just turned out that if you want to download 
the complete SDK you need to compile with mingw anyway...

Temporal DataSet! Filters shouldn't be producing temporal dataset
explicitly. Why do you need it?

Subject: [Paraview] Which QT for 64-Bit Version for Windows

Along those lines here is what I use to build Qt>

configure -nomake demos -nomake examples -debug-and-release -shared - 
fast -exceptions -stl -no-qt3-support

"nmake install" will do NOTHING on Windows. Build Qt where you want it  
"installed", ie, build it in place. Install is NOT supported on  
windows and neither is moving the installation (without a LOT of  
hacking).

So here is a terse setup for building Qt 4.6.2 in Win7 X64 with Visual  
Studio in 64 bit mode.

* Install CMake
* Install Visual Studio making sure to install the 64 bit tools  
(Express Versions of Visual Studio do NOT support compiling a file  
into a 64 bit file).
* Download Qt 4.6.x from Nokia in source form.
* Decompress the Qt download
* Move the Qt project folder to its "Final" installed location
* Reread the last line again.
* Open a Visual Studio x64 Command Prompt
* Reread that last line again.
* Change directories into the qt source folder
* Enter the configuration commands
-- If you want to shorten the build add -no-qtwebkit.
* Let Qt Configure
* Enter "nmake" to finish building Qt. Let that compile for 2 to 6 hours
* Download ParaView source Code
* Using the SAME "Visual Studio x64 Command Prompt" change directories  
to the ParaView source directory
* Create a "x64" directory
* cd "x64"
* cmake-gui ../
* Use the CMake-GUI to generate Visual Studio 2008 x64 Solution
* After the ParaView solution is "Generated", open it from Windows  
Explorer.
* Build ParaView.

Hope that helps.

If you are building a 64 Bit Qt Application the only thing you need to  
download from Nokia is the Qt-Everywhere source code. There is nothing  
else there that will help you. They only have Pre-compiled 32 bit  
binaries for Visual Studio and MinGW. And you can not combine (Easily)  
MinGW libraries with Visual Studio libraries.

Do you have Visual Studio? If so then the only thing you need is the source:

http://get.qt.nokia.com/qt/source/qt-everywhere-opensource-src-4.6.2.zip

Extract that and the open a 64-bit Visual Studio Command Prompt

Start -> Programs -> Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 -> Visual Studio Tools
-> Visual Studio 2008 x64

Then cd into the directory where you extracted the source and run the
following

configure <insert any options you might want>
nmake

I don't think namke install works on Windows.

You should have a fully built Qt that you can build ParaView with.

Thank you all! Good to know that Visual Studio Express won't do the job, 
that already saved me some trouble. I might think about switching to 
mingw before getting Visual Studio though...

Best regards,
Christian

ah....

So : I use file in format v3d.
For a mesh that contains two blocks, they would be called called
block1_timestep1.v3d, block2_timestep1.v3d, block1_timestep2.v3d,
block2_timestep2.v3d, etc...

Actually, I open these v3d_files with a python tool that I have
writen, translate them as vtk.vtkStructuredGrid, and write several files on
the disk as TimeStep1.vtm, TimeStep2.vtm and Simulation.pvd
But this takes a lot a disk space, and reading/writing takes a lot of time.

So I would like to open the v3d file directly in paraview.
That's why I though to use a Programmable Source in order to read all v3d
files and create a "Temporal Data Set".

Hi Mark,

You're git submodule Utilities/Xdmf2 is too recent.

Let me guess. You checked out ParaView from git like this:

% git clone git://paraview.org/ParaView.git
% git submodule init
% git submodule update

Then, for some reason, you did something similar to
% cd Utilities/Xdmf2/
% git branch
* (no branch)
  master
% git checkout master

If you run then cmake, you'll get exactly the error you posted.
Go back to your ParaView source repository (not the Xdmf2 subdir) and issue

% git submodule update
Submodule path 'Utilities/Xdmf2': checked out
'17f7aadc96a0a72c0f8f6e21cd37900db73b1b1f'

then try running cmake again. I bet it'll work then.

Hope that helps.

Sven

Subject: [Paraview] Polyline visualization in ParaView
Message-ID: <4BD1D0B2.6040809@epfl.ch>

Dear all,

I would like export in an xdmf format the results of a 1D numerical 
simulation. Using "polyline" I have created a test file and I am able to 
visualize the line in paraview. However I have some issues:

1) I would like to visualize a 3D cylinder instead of the line. However, 
tube filter is always gray and I cannot use it;
2) If I try to use the plot over line filter I get a segmentation fault;
3) If I try to see the grid connectivity with the related filter, I get 
a message error.

Probably there is something wrong in my data file, however I cannot find it.
Could you help me, please?

Thank you.
Best regards,

   Cristiano Malossi

PS: I am using ParaView 3.8, Linux 64.

Yet I understand why it's not possible to work with TemporalDataSet in
Paraview.
The output of the PVDReader is a MultiBlockDataSet, and the PVDReader
redirect the reader based on the time value.

... Is it possible to create a programmable source that would be aware of
the timestep ?
Or do I have to abandon python and write a reader in the C++ source ?

I think you need to run Delauney on one of the point sets to turn the
point samples floating in space into into a partitioning of space.
Then the probe filter will be able to find values (interolating the

I suspect that this is because you did not set the whole extent in the
RequestInformation script. You need something like:

from paraview import util
util.SetOutputWholeExtent(self, [0, 10, 0, 10, 0, 30])

where the list is i_min, i_max, j_min, j_max, k_min, k_max for the
structured grid. In some cases, this requires actually reading the
data in RequestInformation.

Hey Christiano,

First, I think there may be a couple problems with the data file. It works better for me if I change to NumberOfElements="9" and remove the BaseOffset specifier. (I'm not sure what that part of the API is for...)

The Tube filter is for PolyData, and this file loads in as an Unstructured Grid (you can see this in the Information tab of the Object Inspector panel. One option is to use the Extract Surface filter to change this into a PolyData. I'm not sure if there is another way to just have the reader know this is PolyData in the first place.

After the changes in the first paragraph the Plot Over Line works fine for me, too. (I'm not sure about the Grid Connectivity filter since I never use it and don't really know what it does.)

Hope this helps get you started, at least,
-Eric

You data is an unstructured grid (even though it is just polylines)
and the tube filter expects a polydata. Try "Extract Surface" to
convert to polydata. I made a note that filters like this should work
with unstructured grids. I will file a feature request.

There is indeed something wrong. I suspect that the polyline is
pointing to a point id that does not exist. Keep in mind that ids
start at 0 not 1. Maybe that's the problem?

I've added an example to the Wiki showing how to produce timesteps
from programmable source.
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Here_are_some_more_examples_of_simple_ParaView_3_python_filters.#Producing_Data_with_Timesteps_.28Source.29

There's one caveat currently. The GUI does not realize the timesteps
being produced, so you will have to manually adjust the time ranges
for the animation using the Animation View.

Subject: [Paraview] Xdmf GlobalID attribute removed by Clip

The XDMF in 3.6 did not have the global id attribute so it did the
unsafe thing and let filters have their way with them. It kept the
array around, but in most cases the values in the array at the end of
the pipeline were worthless.

Not that XDMF does have global ids, the clip filter (like most of the
other filters) is doing the safe thing and not keeping the globalids.

Off the top of my head, I can not think of a reason really why the
clip filter shouldn't be allowed to copy the globalids across though.

Erik, try this and see if it works for you:

in vtkTableBasedClipDataSet, look for the three places where it calls
CopyAllocate.
For example:
   outPD->CopyAllocate(inPD, nOutPts);

Insert a line before each one of those that tells VTK that it is OK
top copy this array across.
In that case:
   outPD->SetCopyGlobalIds(1,vtkDataSetAttributes::COPYTUPLE);

The globalIDS will then make it through this filter.

Hey Dave,

I'll definitely try this sometime early next week, but I just wanted to point out something else, first, that may be interfering somewhere:

If you look at the output of the Xdmf reader, like you said, it has allowed Global IDs to be set on the PointData, but they are not read in as idtype (mine says Data type: long), so they aren't recognized by things like the Selection Inspector as real Global Node IDs (the list ends up blank if you try to switch the Selection Type to Global Node IDs). So, I don't know if there is something strange happening when the clip filter tries to copy across the GlobalIds since they're not really of the correct type?

Anyway, thanks for getting back to me on this and I'll let you know how it goes.
-Eric

Not reading in as vtkIdType is an independent bug. It is one we meant
to fix, but haven't gotten to just yet.

Next question,

My scalar data is written to the cell centers and I can't figure out how to
get the coordinates of the cell centers in my programmable filter.

After perusing the vtk documentation (as best as a Fortran programmer can)
it looks I need to do something along the lines of

input = self.GetInputDataObject(0, 0)
> output = self.GetOutputDataObject(0)
>
> inputBlock = input.GetBlock(0)
> # copy old data
> output.CopyStructure(input)

>     sId = cell.GetParametricCenter(pc)
>     cell.EvaluateLocation(sId,pc,coord)
>     # coord should have cell center in xyz space
>

However, 'EvaluateLocation' doesn't appear to be available to me.  How do I
grab the cell center in xyz coordinates?

Thanks again,
Peter.

You no longer need the initial part for loading the XML. You can directly use:

 tp = sm.sources.TrivialProducer()

and that should work.

I submitted a bug report here:

http://public.kitware.com/Bug/view.php?id=10607

as this is still happening with the latest git version of Paraview.

Thanks,

I also tried with Paraview-3.6.2.

Below is the code:

#! /usr/bin/pvpython

from paraview.simple import *
from paraview.simple import servermanager as sm
from paraview import vtk

# connect internally
connection=sm.Connect()


# Set the pvpython path
INPUTFILE="test.vtu"
OUTPUTFILE="tested.vtu"

# create a reader
reader=sm.sources.XMLUnstructuredGridReader(FileName=INPUTFILE)

# get the data i.e moves data from the server to the client
data = sm.Fetch(reader)

ndata=vtk.vtkUnstructuredGrid();
ndata.CopyStructure(ndata);
ndata.GetPointData().AddArray(data.GetPointData().GetArray(0));


f=open('trivialproducer.xml','r')
parser=sm.vtkSMXMLParser()
parser.Parse(f.read())
parser.ProcessConfiguration(sm.vtkSMObject.GetProxyManager())

# Update the modules
sm.updateModules()

tp=sm.sources.TrivialProducer()
obj=tp.GetClientSideObject()
obj.SetOutput(ndata)


writer=sm.writers.XMLUnstructuredGridWriter(DataMode=1,FileName=OUTPUTFILE,Input=obj)

writer.UpdatePipeline()


The errors:

getting appended

Is there any possible ways to write out the client-side data?

Dear Berk,

thank you for the help. With the "extract surface filter" it works fine.
I agree that would be nice to use directly the tube filter also with the 
Polyline objects.
Unfortunately I get confused from this page:

http://cs.unc.edu/~taylorr/Comp715/ParaView3_2_Tutorial.html

where it is stated: "For example, if the current object is of type 
structured grid, the tube filter will not be active in the 'Filters' 
menu since it can be only applied to polylines."

Yes you are right. I tried a lot of options to make it working, and 
before sending the email I forgot to remove the BaseOffset. That is my 
fault. Sorry!

Here are my results from 3.7 (consequently 3.8 or git master should
work as well).

What exactly is the goal with your script? Are you always going to use
sm.Connect() or do you intend to connect to a remote server as well?

The goal is to get the first array from the PointData of a vtu file, and
then write it to a new vtu file.

No, there is no remote server involved. All the data files are local.

I simplified the code and tried it on Paraview3.8.0. It reads in a vtu file,
fetch the data and then write it back to a new file. But still got errors as
follow.

Script:

from paraview.simple import *
from paraview.simple import servermanager as sm
from paraview import vtk

# connect internally
connection=sm.Connect()

# Set the pvpython path
INPUTFILE="test.vtu"
OUTPUTFILE="tested.vtu"

# create a reader
reader=sm.sources.XMLUnstructuredGridReader(FileName=INPUTFILE)

# get the data i.e moves data from the server to the client
data=sm.Fetch(reader)

tp=sm.sources.TrivialProducer()
obj=tp.GetClientSideObject()
obj.SetOutput(data)

writer=sm.writers.XMLUnstructuredGridWriter(DataMode=2,FileName=OUTPUTFILE,Input=obj)

writer.UpdatePipeline()


Errors:

getting appended

Any clues?

Hi Ayachit ,

When I did what you told me, when applying FixedPoint Mapper,the result is
correct,but when applying GPU Mapper,the result is still wrong. It seems
that the GPU mapper has a bug.

Best wishes,

-Ning

Subject: [Paraview] Writer with 2 inputs
Message-ID: <4BD40A1E.9090209@rwth-aachen.de>

Hello!

I have a writer plugin that takes 2 inputs, both vtkImageData. When I 
use it in Python, everything is fine, I can set the "Input" and the 
"MaskImage" explicitly to provide the two inputs. However, when I am 
using the "Save Data" dialog and choose my writer, it won't set the 
required input for port 0 (the Mask Image):

"Input port 0 of algorithm vtkMeasureMark(0x7780070) has 0 connections 
but is not optional."

I have attached the ServerManagerXML and an image that shows the dialog 
that appear with that xml. The MaskImage is not choosable.

Is there any way to realize this? I tried renaming the inputs to 
"Input1" and "Input2", but then the Filter isn't listed anymore, because 
obviously Paraview is looking for a "Input" property when calling a 
writer...


Best regards,
Christian

Subject: [Paraview] How to plot simple 3d graphic?
Message-ID: <g2x9eeaee7b1004250403n1bf344e2v9372d7191793fa04@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
Is it possible to draw simple a 3d graphic in Paraview? E.g. I have 2D
function f(x, y)=x^2 + y^2, I have generated input file with DATASET
STRUCTURED_POINTS. Now, what I need is to draw 3D parabola with or
without grid lines. Is it possible at all with Paraview? I have
managed to obtain 2D picture with color gradient only, by using
Surface representation style in Display menu.

Thank you in advance
Artem

Yes, that's correct. That bug was recently resolved.

scripting style (since ParaView 3.6)


from paraview.simple import *
from paraview.simple import servermanager as sm
from paraview import vtk

# Set the pvpython path

OUTPUTFILE="tested.vtu"

# create a reader

# get the data i.e moves data from the server to the client
data=sm.Fetch(reader)

tp=TrivialProducer()
obj=tp.GetClientSideObject()
obj.SetOutput(data)

writer=XMLUnstructuredGridWriter(DataMode=2,FileName=OUTPUTFILE)
writer.UpdatePipeline()

On further investigation, it looks like the bug was marked resolved
accidentally. It's currently planned to be resolved by 3.8.2.

It is possible although not super straightforward. First apply the
Extract Surface filter to convert your data to polydata then apply
Warp Scalar and warp the data in the z direction with the variable you
want to plot. Turn on the Cube Axes actor in the representation (or is
it called display?) panel to see the axes.

Ah..that's a use case that isn't supported currently. Only 1 input
writers are supported. Feel free to add a feature request to the bug

Subject: [Paraview] [Bug] color edits in toolbar not visible in object
	inspector
Message-ID: <4BD4EE1F.5010307@web.de>

I first reported this bug back when 3.6.1 was the current version, but 
it appears not to have been fixed in the current version 3.8 (RC1).

Basically, color changes made with in the (active variables) toolbar's 
"edit color map" button, are not picked up by object inspector "set 
solid color" dialog.

To reproduce:

- create a simple object
- using the toolbar, reset the color (to red for example)
- check the color of the object in the object inspector -- the color 
remains the default white.

Note:
- Color changes made with the object inspector register in the toolbar.
- Because the save state file menu option/command saves the color that 
is registered in the object inspector, the default color is saved as 
part of the state, not the new, updated color.

Message-ID: <4BD4F06E.7070003@web.de>

Hi -

Would the developers consider making PVD files expandable (and 
collapsable)? It would be nice to be able to see the contents of a PVD 
file and possible hide/suppress the display of parts of the the PVD 
file. This would be a great way to reduce clutter.

Thank for this example.

But I'm trying to apply this to my case, and have one question again .....
:-|

 # TODO: Generate the data as you want.

---> That should be the DataSet at one timestep ?
How does the programmable source handle the change of the filename to read ?
Should I use a command sort of "executive.GetActiveTimeStep()" when I define
the filename to read ?

... I answer myself : I have to use the req_timestep variable, and do
something like


> ModulePerso.ReadMultiBlockFromV3D(*'filename%s'%(req_timestep)*)


If that could help other people, there is on the internet a presentation
that explains quite well how time is managed in Paraview, especially slide
32.

For seven days all of my builds have been missing from the dashboard.

I just looked at
ParaView3_Build/Testing/Temporary/LastSubmit_20100426-0100.log on
bubbles and murron and they say that the submission was successful.

Does anybody know what's going on?

Message-ID: <7F910D38-B04E-4ADE-AC03-4AF7487C7DBA@bluequartz.net>

Just tried a 'Make install' and after installation (to the wrong  
directory**) my custom plugins that are built as part of ParaView  
(using PARAVIEW_EXTRA_EXTERNAL_MODULE). Is this going to be fixed  
before the full release comes out?


**I have a CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX of /Users/Shared/Toolkits/ParaView-3.8  
but when I run 'make install' ParaView gets installed into / 
Applications? I tried exporting DESTDIR=$CMAKE_INSTALL_PATH but that  
did not seem to help either. I do not have write access to / 
Applications for this user account so this "feature" is a real problem.

We switched to git! Most of the dashboards are switched over using a new
paraview_common script (very similar to the cmake_common one you may be
familiar with). Though it seems the rewritten scripts aren't functional on
many machines. I will resume getting them to submit over the comming days as
I get a chance to spend time and see whats wrong on each of them.

My pvd components, do you mean blocks in a multiblock dataset? That's
one of the feature's we are thinking about for future release. Any
suggestions about the user interface from the community are always
welcome :).

Also, the dashboard site changed from ParaView3 to ParaView. So if any
dashboard is still doing a build from a cvs checkout it will use an outdated
CtestConfig which still points to ParaView3

I would recommend:

cpack --config <build-dir>/Applications/ParaView/CPackParaViewConfig.cmake
-G DragNDrop

As per: http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView:Build_And_Install

If you do make install I believe it just runs all install rules and I don't
believe any of the fixup bundle routines get called.

Dave,
  I am really confused. Is ParaView on Git or CVS? Last I was told I  
should still be using CVS for the 3.8-RC1 branch? Should I be pulling  
from Git now instead?

Thanks for any clarifications.

Thanks, I'll give that a try. "Make install" does fixup the bundle  
correctly. I just left out my plugins.

  So I have to do a cpack run in order to get a working installation  
on my local machine? ie, an "installation" that is NOT in my build  
directory? Seems odd.

Message-ID: <4BD5B7C7.1090706@web.de>

I don't know what you mean by multiblock dataset, but here's an example 
of how I use PVD files -- to compose multiple files:

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<VTKFile type="Collection" version="0.1" byte_order="LittleEndian">
	<Collection>
		<DataSet timestep="0" file="Data_Patch_0.vtp"/>
		<DataSet timestep="0" file="Data_Patch_1.vtp"/>
		<DataSet timestep="0" file="Data_Patch_2.vtp"/>
	</Collection>
</VTKFile>

It would be nice to be able to expand the PVD file in the pipeline 
browser in order to see its various file components and optionally hide 
some of them. For example, if the view is cluttered, I may wish to 
suppress the display of Data_Patch_1.vtp.

Regards,

Message-ID: <z2g395712631004260903l6a73193bs65a88718f5182fa8@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

Unless i'm mistaken, It seems that the Calculator in Paraview can't assume
the arrays that are defined in the FieldData.
Is this function planned for future releases ?
It would indeed be very convenient for working with constant values defined

Since I'll be spending the afternoon re-configuring my dashboard
scripts, is there a page detailing how to make a dashboard submission
the with git and the new paraview_common scripts?

There are 4 buttons in the top left of the render window. The right
two have pop up text of "Edit View Options" and  "Adjust Camera", but
the left two do not have pop up text. I think it would be helpful if
they did. Anyone agree/disagree?

Thanks,

Good Morning,

MultiBlockDataSet is what you have when you read your pvd file. See the tab
"Information" in the Object Browser to be sure.
But in your case, all the timesteps are 0 ? .... Then maybe you should
better user a .vtm file.

However, I completely agree with you. What you suggest would be a very
convenient tool.
For a MultiBlockDataSet, in the tab "Information" of the object inspector,
it would be great to have the possibility to hide some of the DataSets, or
better, to completely desactivate some components.
Regards,

A.Marsan

I use Paraview with personnal sources and filter that I have written in
Python.

Each personnal filter that I write begin with this line :

> import pyturbo.


Is there a way to avoid this line ?
That means : can Paraview automatically import a module ?

Great. And what branch is being used for the RC-1?

  Maybe the ParaView Downloads page should be updated or at least  
annotated with the fact that git is now being used instead of CVS?

Not really, imports are typical with python and any module that you
want to use needs to be imported.

This looks to be a bug. I will add tool tip information to the camera undo /
redo buttons.

I just tried to pull from the "release" branch and got the following  
errors:

532:[mjackson at Ferb:ParaView]$ git pull origin release

I'll admit up front that I am still coming up the Git learning tree so  
I may have done something stupid when checking out the sources..

  I also looked on the ParaView Wiki at the Git page but nothing was  
there specific to working with the release branch.

Thanks for any pointers.

Subject: [Paraview] filled boxes / particles while doing a clip through the
	data
Message-ID: <w2y1d8595cb1004261041y83aee833z64ad3da359a84e57@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

at the moment I'm doing my master thesis and I'm fighting with the following
problem: I'd like to visualize a set of voxels (coordinates x,y,z and one
material property of the voxel, which can be chosen, are given). In the
following there's an small example of the data I'd like to import in PV:

x    y    z     material
0    0    0    1
0    1    0    0
0    1    1    2
1    0    0    1
1    1    1    3
1    2    3    0

For the first try I chose an VTK unstructured grid file; it has been
imported in PV as "VTK unstructured grid". In the following I created a
glyph with boxes. That works fine, but afterwards I tried to do a clip and
the major problem came up: within the clip the boxes are empty - only the
walls of the boxes are displayed. It's mandatory that the boxes are filled.

I also tried another solution: import of the VTK-file as a VTK particle
file, the glyph function works also fine and the clip function produces
filled (I suppose so...hard to say) boxes, but the information / material
property is lost. I appended the VTK-file at the end.

It will be perfect if someone might help me and knows a solution to get
solid/filled boxes including the scalar material property. Is this an issue
of the VTK-file? In case of - where's my mistake or what should I change?
The export format of my data is quite flexible...

Thanks a lot in advance for hints, have a nice evening,
Karl

I kinda thought that is what was happening but I couldn't figure out  
how to get a "clean" checkout of the "release" branch. Thanks for the  
info. Should I add a short blurb to the Wiki about this?

Do you have a tutorial that teachs how to make it works since the MPI

Karl,
I took a quick look, and tried to load your data (as listed below) as a .vtu file.  I didn't load into paraview 3.6.2, and I noticed the following:

*         You need a starting line that is as follows:   <?xml version="1.0"?>

*         You are creating lots of points, with data, but unstructured grids need some type of connectivity.  Notice that I am using type 10, VTK_TETRA in the example below.


  Here is a little test file that I have thrown together.  Notice the <Cells> section.

Subject: [Paraview] filled boxes / particles while doing a clip through the data

Hi,

at the moment I'm doing my master thesis and I'm fighting with the following problem: I'd like to visualize a set of voxels (coordinates x,y,z and one material property of the voxel, which can be chosen, are given). In the following there's an small example of the data I'd like to import in PV:

x    y    z     material
0    0    0    1
0    1    0    0
0    1    1    2
1    0    0    1
1    1    1    3
1    2    3    0

For the first try I chose an VTK unstructured grid file; it has been imported in PV as "VTK unstructured grid". In the following I created a glyph with boxes. That works fine, but afterwards I tried to do a clip and the major problem came up: within the clip the boxes are empty - only the walls of the boxes are displayed. It's mandatory that the boxes are filled.

I also tried another solution: import of the VTK-file as a VTK particle file, the glyph function works also fine and the clip function produces filled (I suppose so...hard to say) boxes, but the information / material property is lost. I appended the VTK-file at the end.

It will be perfect if someone might help me and knows a solution to get solid/filled boxes including the scalar material property. Is this an issue of the VTK-file? In case of - where's my mistake or what should I change? The export format of my data is quite flexible...

Thanks a lot in advance for hints, have a nice evening,
Karl

I have VisIt, for which there is a plugin that reads in the unstructured netcdf data of the model I am using (FVCOM).  I notice that there is a VisItReaderPlugin plugin in paraview.  Can this plugin be used to read into paraview FVCOM-generated data via VisIt; i.e. can I transfer my VisIt-loaded file over to paraview using this plugin?

thanks,

This is odd.  Your header states that it follows the CF convention, but your description of the data is clearly incompatible with the CF convention.  Could you send me a sample data set?

Subject: Re: [Paraview] trouble reading in netCDF file

I don't really understand this description, but I can say with confidence that the netCDF reader will not read this convention.  The CF convention does not support unstructured triangular grids (or any unstructured grids, for that matter).  The (general) netCDF reader knows how to read 1-, 2-, and 3-D arrays as regular grids with some conventions on setting coordinates to the points in the grid.

NetCDF is not a data format description.  It is simply an I/O library that specifies how to read/write arrays with some annotation.  Thus, if you have data in a netCDF file that has a structure more complicated than simple arrays, you will have to create a reader that understands how to construct the data format.  From your description, it sounds like you will have to create your own reader.

Hi,

Thanks Ken.

I'm using 3.8 now, but am have some similar troubles.  To recap: I'm using unstructured triangular grid.  The 'dimensions' variables include integer identifiers for triangle nodes, but NOT lat,long and depth.  Rather, these are included among the 'variables' variables (e.g. lat = lat(node)).

Paraview is reading in the data correctly.  But I need it to use the 'variable' variables lat, long, and depth to serve as the coordinates of the grid.  All other 'variables' variables are of course functions of the 'dimensions' variables only, but are to be plotted over the 3D space determined by lat, long and depth.

Can this be done in Paraview?

thanks
Joel

Subject: Re: [Paraview] trouble reading in netCDF file

The netCDF reader in version understands the COARDS convention (a common subset of CF).  It sounds like the variable annotation you describe should be supported.  However, one major limitation of the netCDF reader is that it only supports reading variables of the same dimensions because it puts them all on the same grid.  So if you have selected to load variables with different dimensions, it will use the dimensions of the first variable and fail to load the rest.  That would explain the behavior you are getting since most netCDF files I have run into seem to have variables with low dimension listed first. (There is no particular reason for this.  It just seems to be what people/applications do.) If this is the case, you are probably also getting a lot of warnings from the netCDF reader about it and the Information panel will be missing many of your variables.  Try turning off all variables in the Object Inspector and turning on only one variable you are interested in.

If this is the problem, it should go away in version 3.8.  Realizing this the 3.6 interface to the netCDF reader really sucks, I changed it to select dimensions instead of variables.  All variables conforming to the selected dimensions are loaded.  It makes using the netCDF reader much easier and problems like the one I described go away.  I also expanded the reader to understand most of the CF convention.

Unfortunately, don't use the CVS for this just yet.  I have recently discovered that a new netCDF reader that was apparently built for a specific use case but seems to screw up on most data was added to ParaView and it is overriding the existing netCDF reader.  We are trying to work on a resolution.

Hi,

Thank you Ken for responding.

I suspect that your diagnosis is correct; the root of the problem, I believe, is that I am reading in netCDF data that follows the CF convention.   In particular, the grid is an unstructured triangular 2D grid ('poly data' grid in the venacular of paraview).  The 'dimensions' variables include integer identifiers for triangle nodes, but NOT lat, long, x, y, time etc.  Rather, these are included among the 'variables' variables (e.g. lat = lat(node)).

Is the problem indeed that the paraview netCDF reader cannot understand this particular netCDF-CF file?  Is there a way around this, without having to change the way the data is outputted (from netCDF-CF to netCDF-COARDS convention)?  Note that I can read into paraview certain variables by filtering out the 1-dimensional variables (lat, long etc.), but of course these variables do not have the correct dependencies (they should be dependent on the variables I filtered out - lat, long etc.)

thanks,
Joel

It sounds like you are reading in an array with 0 or 1 dimensions (not including time).  Although the reader should happily create an image data of that structure, the standard rendering views only understand image data of 2 or 3 dimensions.  Hence you get the error.

If you want to see the data in a plot, try adding the "Plot Data" filter.

Hi,

I am trying to read in a netCDF file using Paraview 3.6.2.  It can 'see' the netCDF file, but when I attempt to read in the file by pressing 'Apply', I get the following error message:

ERROR: In /home/kitware/ParaView3/Utilities/BuildScripts/ParaView-3.6/ParaView3/Servers/Filters/vtkTexturePainter.cxx, line 280
vtkTexturePainter (0xb8a0000): Incorrect dimensionality.

I'm not sure which netCDF release created the netCDF file.  However, I read in a previous post that paraview 3.6.1 could handle netCDF 4, and since  "all netCDF files ever written can always be read by the latest netCDF release. That is, we guarantee backward data compatibility" then 3.6.2 should be able to handle my netCDF file (which wasn't created too recently).

I can read the netCDF file into MATLAB, so it isn't corrupt.

So what's the problem?

thanks
Joel

Marsan, what does a VTM file look like?

In addition to expanding the VTP (and VTM) files. It is possible to add 
more object/primitive detail in the statistics inspector. It may useful 
to expand an object so that point values, poly-face coordinates etc. can 
be read/seen.

it looks like .pvd file, without time.
Such a file can be writen with vtk.vtkMultiBlockDataWriter()

Hy ! 

I *m using Paraview 3.8 but reading any kind of .cube file made from Gaussian 03 , crashes paraview also if i read a .pdb file there is nothing or just one line.  

thank you

Dear all,

In a Paraview Programmable Filter, I need to use all the multiblocks at the
different timesteps defined in the Animation View.
How can we acess to different timesteps in a PPF ?
The issue of what I want to do is similar to that of the temporal averaging.

Aur?lien

A little clarification : I work with 500 timesteps. So I would like to avoid
the Temporal Cache.....

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview3.8 RC1 crash in remote X
Message-ID: <k2l5f395e811004270424wdf297786j90c81dbcd2574bd8@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
I have installed binaries of paraview 3.8-RC1 on an ubuntu 9.04. I launch
paraview locally, and it work very well. But if I launched paraview in
remote X, the paraview splash screen is displayed and then it crashes.
I have no problem with the version 3.6.2 of paraview binaries.

I have the same problem if I build paraview 3.8-RC1.

A core file is created and with gdb I have this log :

Subject: [Paraview] Bug with PV_PLUGIN_DEBUG in Windows
Message-ID: <4BD6CABB.8000803@rwth-aachen.de>

Hi!

I just wanted to confirm the presence of a bug that arises as soon as 
you set the environment variable PV_PLUGIN_DIR in Windows. ( The bug is 
that Paraview crashes ) I installed everything I need on yet another 
fresh computer. This time it was:

Windows XP 64-Bit
Paraview 3.8RC1
CMake 2.8.1

Setup: Paraview with Shared-Libs, Qt-Support, Python
Compiler: Visual Studio 2008

The exact same behaviour (crash) is on an equivalent setup with Windows 
7 32-Bit. The crash happens as soon as an arbitrary plugin (e.g. one of 
the prelisted plugins) is loaded. On both systems everyting, starting 
from QT was installed from scratch an no version of any involved 
software pieces were ever installed before on these systems.


Best regards,
Christian

Subject: [Paraview] Sanity Check - Parallel GPU rendering
Message-ID: <B069C15419294D7D8D3BC0EEF0999B4D@notebook>

Hi All,

I am trying to get parallel GPU accelerated volume rendering happening and I
just want to confirm my understanding below is correct...

For GPU acceleration I will require X Server running on each node so that
ParaView can create a local OpenGL context to enable OpenGL calls to the
hardware. The OpenGL context needs to use something like NVIDIA libraries as
it ignores anything that might have OpenGL implemented in software (e.g.
Mesa).

Googling shows me that it is possible to create screenless X Server
configurations that use video hardware (e.g. with a NVIDIA Tesla). So in a
cluster I am assuming that this is what I need to do for each node that I
wish to participate in the parallel rendering.

Is the above correct? Or is there a simplier way of doing it?

Cheers,

Paul

Subject: [Paraview] Extract edges: don't line up with input geometry?
Message-ID: <4BD6D8BB.1050102@sara.nl>

Hi,

I have an input polydata set consisting of n-sided polygons with n in
the range 3 up to 12 (I'm guessing here), i.e. not just triangles and
quads. If I run an Extract Edges filter on this set the edges do not
line up at all with input polygons (see screenshot). I'm sure I didn't
accidentally introduce any transforms myself, so I don't understand
where the mismatch is coming from. It also looks like the offset isn't
consistent, as for some polygons the edges are shifted in +X direction,
and other in -X. Is the filter somehow loosing precision during
computations?

Any clues?

Thanks in advance,
Paul

Hi Odile,

Which version of ParaView are you using? Can you try to build ParaView
from the 3.8 branch? There has been some changes to improve the
scalability of the EnSight reader in parallel (not SOS but regular
EnSight files).

Hey Dave,

Unfortunately, that didn't fix it. There's something else strange going on. 

The Clip filter seems to lose both the (point data) array that's set as the Global IDs (whether int, long or idtype), plus any array that is "idtype". You can see the latter behavior by doing Generate IDs filter on a Point Source, and a Clip will lose the (point) Ids array (even though Generate IDs doesn't set the array it generates as the Global IDs for the point or cell data). 

I've tested this out a few different ways, and this seems to be the pattern -- the Clip doesn't seem to lose any plain (i.e. non-global-id) int or long point attributes, it will lose any Global ID array (int, long or idtype), and it loses all idtype arrays. I haven't tried much with Cell Data (although the Clip doesn't lose the idtype cell data attribute generated by Generate IDs).

Here are the changes I made just so you can check that I didn't make a silly mistake in trying out your fix:

I haven't tried this in pure VTK, but I can do that if you'd like (in the next day or two). If a quick fix isn't obvious to you based on these observations, you can let me know whether you think this should go in as a VTK or ParaView bug.

Thanks again,
-Eric

I also have the same problem.  And, we have to use remote X, since we debug ParaView on remote (out of state) systems.

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview3.8 RC1 crash in remote X

Hello,
I have installed binaries of paraview 3.8-RC1 on an ubuntu 9.04. I launch paraview locally, and it work very well. But if I launched paraview in remote X, the paraview splash screen is displayed and then it crashes.
I have no problem with the version 3.6.2 of paraview binaries.

I have the same problem if I build paraview 3.8-RC1.

A core file is created and with gdb I have this log :

Where do I get paraview_common.cmake and vtk_common.cmake?


I can get my builds to work with git but I noticed that parallel
building is broken for my old scripts so I guess it's time for an update.

I have worked with Gaussian, and cube files in the past. I have done some
work in ParaView using cube files too, and did not observe a crash unless
the cube file with gzipped. I am also not certain that support for cube
files with multiple MOs is present. As Robert said, if you can supply an
example cube file that causes a crash then we can look into it.

I worked on some of the code in Open Babel responsible for reading/writing
cube files too, and so am quite familiar with that and the PDB format. I
just tried with ParaView as built yesterday and can open PDB files too. A
wire frame representation is rendered after clicking on apply.

Thanks,

Marcus

If you look here you can see vtk_common.

http://www.cdash.org/CDash/viewNotes.php?buildid=595568

<http://www.cdash.org/CDash/viewNotes.php?buildid=595568>And here is
paraview_common.

http://www.cdash.org/CDash/viewNotes.php?buildid=595953

Though if you have you're own simpler script that is perfectly fine. The
common scripts attempt to make things easier by deleting your source tree if
it is using CVS still doing the initial commit and submodule updates.

Note these are still getting modified as you can see I don't have all of the
VTK dashboards restored nor most of the ParaView.

What! Copy and paste from a web page!

With all this talk of the CVS to git transition I forgot I could do that
until just after I sent that last e-mail.

OK, I try a little harder to find the right combination variables to get
the parallel build to work.

Thank you!

By remote X, are you guys referring to X-forwarding over ssh?

Subject: [Paraview] Parallel build/test and git
Message-ID: <4BD73676.5030400@ohiou.edu>

This is probably a cmake issue but...

I can not get cmake-2.8.1 or cmake built from cvs to build ParaView
(VTK, or ITK) in parallel.

I have tried setting both

   set(CTEST_BUILD_FLAGS "-i -j8")

and

   set(CTEST_BUILD_COMMAND "/usr/bin/gmake -i -j8")

but neither has any effect.

The old CMakeCache.txt variable

   MAKECOMMAND:STRING=/usr/bin/gmake -i -j8

works only for cmake-2.6 ( and earlier. )

cmake-2.6 does not support git.

cmake-2.6 does not support parallel testing.

Hmm, I believe kargad is building its submission in parallel:

cmake-2.8.1
set (CTEST_BUILD_FLAGS "-j 8")

Maybe there is something to be gleaned from:

Do you actually see 8 compiler processes?

The time seems right but I don't trust the times on the dashboard right now.

I don't see anything new there unless paraview_common.cmake is changing
very rapidly and everybody has a different version.

This is what makes me the most doubtful :

$ find CMake/ -exec grep -l CTEST_BUILD_FLAGS '{}' \;
CMake/Source/CTest/cmCTestBuildCommand.cxx
$ grep CTEST_BUILD_FLAGS CMake/Source/CTest/cmCTestBuildCommand.cxx
      : this->Makefile->GetDefinition("CTEST_BUILD_FLAGS");
[kevin at bubbles kitware]$

CTEST_BUILD_FLAGS is mentioned only once in all of CMake!

It's not mentioned at all in ParaView.

$ find ParaView/ -exec grep -l CTEST_BUILD_FLAGS '{}' \;
$

I just confirmed that it does spawn 8 compiler instances, I do not
pretend to understand the cmake magic behind it.

I just got 12 compiler instances out of a test cmake script that just has :

# Client maintainer: hobbsk at ohiou.edu
set(CTEST_SITE "bubbles.hooperlab")
set(CTEST_BUILD_NAME "ParallelBuildTest")
set(CTEST_BUILD_CONFIGURATION Debug)
set(CTEST_CMAKE_GENERATOR "Unix Makefiles")
set(CTEST_BUILD_FLAGS "-i -j 12")
include(${CTEST_SCRIPT_DIRECTORY}/paraview_common.cmake)

I guess it's time to start adding lines one at a time...

Is there any interest in adding these registration functionalities to Paraview:

http://public.kitware.com/Bug/view.php?id=8998
http://public.kitware.com/Bug/view.php?id=8999

If not, we can close the above feature requests.

Does anyone else want to be able to create polygons in Paraview:

http://public.kitware.com/Bug/view.php?id=9020

I guess this is just a VTK filter thing, so can it be moved to the VTK
bug tracker and the comment about Paraview handling errors better
removed?
http://public.kitware.com/Bug/view.php?id=9213

Thanks,

David

This approach seems correct.

You would need to configure one X screen per GPU you have.

nvidia-xconfig -a --use-display-device=none

After that, start the X server. Next, write a machine file which will run
one
instance of a paraview render on each GPU. You would need to set the
DISPLAY environment variable  to point to the X server and X screen
corresponding to each GPU.

Use this machine file with mpirun and use the ParaView client to connect
to the machine on rank 0.

I'm not much of a ParaView user, but I have setup parallel rendering using
this method.

There's another way to make *real* parallel GPU rendering.
If you want to use the power of some GPU from unrelated cards (non-SLI but
in the same computer) or from some graphical nodes, you can use VirtualGL
with Sort-Last or Sort-First rendering, who will be very usefull and
efficient to get very goods performances, and not just use 1 or 2 local GPU
to render your paraview instance.

Cheers.

Philippe.

Hi!

We could definitely use a Iterative Clostes Points Interface in Paraview 
here. You have my vote for this feature request.

Best regards,
Christian

Could you explain this usage of VirtualGL a little more ?

I am running ParaView render servers across multiple nodes, each of which
may have one or more GPUs. Each server does local rendering on a GPU on the
same node.  MPI takes care of job launching across multiple nodes. I am
hoping this would give me the best possible performance, so someone please
correct me if I am wrong :-)

So this will able you to use as many as you want GPU for one rendering,
because mpi use only CPU, then I found a my test machine (core i7 920 with a
Quad-SLI of GTX295) that paraview got faster rendering if he's launched
with VirtualGL (rendering by GPU) than standalone (rendering by CPU). Maybe
my vision is not exact, but in fact, performances are very different ! Let's
give a try to VirtualGL Shree :)

Hello,

A funny bug.
I wanted to do MultiBlockDataSet.SetBlock(numbloc, ...)     with numbloc < 0

This operation has taken all the memory of the cluster I work on.... and all
my colleages too.
Fortunately I closed all processes before the drama.

Something to avoid this infinite loop would be welcome... !

The ICP interface was much easier than the LandmarkTransform
interface. I simply take two vtkPolyData inputs, pass them to the
vtkIterativeClosestPointTransform filter, then apply that transform to
the source dataset with vtkTransformPolyDataFilter. It has some
checkboxes for options of which type of transform to use (rigid,
similarity, affine) and a check box for "align centers".

Here is the code and a good pair of sample data:
http://www.rpi.edu/~doriad/Paraview_List/ICP/

Please let me know what you think!

David

Thanks.

Erm ... what does a *.vts file look like?

(VTM and VTS files are not described in the file formats document.)

Subject: [Paraview] Ensight Reader
Message-ID: <5709338.701701.1272464845889.JavaMail.fmail@mwmweb026>

I have some trouble with reading Ensight-Data into Paraview. When I read the Ensight-case-file the following error occurs:

ERROR: In ..\..\..\src\Servers\Filters\vtkEnSightGoldBinaryReader2.cxx, line 1112
vtkEnSightGoldBinaryReader2 (0EFC3ED8): This is not a binary data set. Try vtkEnSightGoldReader2.

 Modified Time: 79018
 Reference Count: 1
 Registered Events: (none)
 Request: REQUEST_DATA
 FROM_OUTPUT_PORT: 0

Obviously, the error is caused by the "measured geometry" part of the Ensight-dataset. When I remove the corresponding lines in the case file, I can at least have a look at the thermodynamic data of the flow-field. I looked at the data with Ensight already and I did not produce any problems. Is there an issue with the data-reader in Paraview?

Werner

Hi Werner:

    The VTK EnSight reader is able to load measured geometry files.

    Could you please send me your dataset for me to debug the problem?

    Thanks.

Hi Augusto,

Yes, the cave mode is supported by ParaView 3.8 RC1.
See the following wiki page for instructions to use the cave:
http://paraview.org/Wiki/Configuring_Server_Environment_Using_*.pvx_XML_Files#Cave_Rendering

Please let me know if you have any question or if you encounter problems,
I'll be happy to update the wiki page with the issues you encounter.

Regards,
Julien.

Is cave mode working for Paraview 3.8 RC1?

Do you have a tutorial that teachs how to make it works since the MPI
configuration?

Message-ID: <58C5A19E-7939-4694-B760-1D7060029874@bluequartz.net>

I am having a problem building ParaView against a prebuilt HDF5  
library. I set the PARAVIEW_USE_SYSTEM_HDF5=ON during the initial  
CMake Configuration. The problem is that FindHDF5.cmake that is  
included with ParaView is pretty basic and can not find the HDF5 that  
is installed on my system.

  Can we possibly include a file with a bit more searching  
capabilities? I have a candidate that I think will work (works with my  
projects) or is there a way to over-ride the CMAKE_MODULE_PATH from  
the command line?

  This is on Windows with Visual Studio (64 bit if it really matters)

Message-ID: <CF593D13-2BAF-4629-AE66-9D9578C64D2C@ec-nantes.fr>

Hi everybody,

I have a very large dataset (structuregrid). (1E4 X 1E4 X 1E4 X 3 )
I will like to know if is possible for the reader (home made reader)  
to know the resolution of the screen and the volume of space that the  
camera is looking at.

I will like to generate de data only for the viewable portion of the  
space (at the right resolution).

The idea is to have something like "google hearth".

Streaming and AdaptiveParaView do that like so:

reader supplies meta information including piece bounding boxes

a filter, vtkVisibilityPrioritizer, is inserted at the end of the pipeline

vtkVisibiltyPrioritizer gets the camera/viewport and the bounding
boxes (if they are not transformed by the intermediate filters) and
rejects pieces that are offscreen so that they are never
read/processed at all

AdaptiveParaView goes one step further and progressively increases the
sampling resolution of each piece

some very recent work by Jon Woodring @ LANL goes further and uses the
screen resolution to improve the resolution sampling algorithm and
works with unstructured data of a particular format

Feel free to try/extend and or borrow from those two experimental
ParaView applications.

There is a FindHDF5 that is built into CMake, I think 2.8, that was
re-written and vastly improved in the not so distant past. When we switch
VTK/ParaView to require CMake 2.8 we can remove the one in ParaView which
will then use the one included in CMake. I haven't gotten the go ahead but
it is something we will probably do very soon.

Hi Werner:

    The problem is due to the inconsistency between the geometry files and
the 'measured geometry' files in terms of ASCII / Binary format. Currently
the VTK EnSight reader assumes that these two kinds of geometry files (and
their respective data attributes --- pressure, temperature, and et al) adopt
the same ASCII / Binary format. Specifically, the geoemtry file (Binary for
your dataset --- the associated data attributes are binary) is first parsed
to determine the type and hence vtkEnSightGoldBinaryReader2 is invoked. This
binary reader is then used to load the 'measured geometry' file (ASCII for
your dataset --- the associated 'measured' data attributes are ASCII),
causing the problem.

   If you make the whole dataset (including the geometry files and the data
sttributes) use the same ASCII/Binary format, the problem should disappear.

Right, In CMake 2.8.1, I Checked. I'll assume that you are NOT going  
to switch the ParaView 3.8 branch from Cmake 2.6.x to CMake 2.8 BEFORE  
it is released which would be a pretty large last minute change.
   So basically, for the ParaView 3.8 branch this will be left  
unfixed? I just need to know how I am going to formulate my work- 
around until PV 3.10 is released.

True, I can copy the CMake version onto the branch if that sounds
reasonable? Let me consult with my spiritual advisors first before I commit
to anything. ;-)

That would wonderful. I can see how that one reacts with what I use.

And bear in mind that once I am confident enough to push git nonsense to kitware and everywhere else, then I'll be upgrading the hdf5 in paraview to 1.8 

And that is before paraview 3.10, it will be on the 3.8.x something release.

Actually Mike, doesn't our hdf5 require cmake 1.8 anyway?

in which case we should make the cmake switch in paraview, I'd forgotten about that.

On the dev list, upgrading hdf5 was agreed, but the cmake change was not.

Comments?

JB

I'm not sure what version of CMake the HDF5-CMake project requires. I  
was coding all of my stuff to CMake 2.6 then the last time I pulled  
the HDF5-CMake sources there was the Cmake 2.8 Min requirement. So  
don't know.

Hey Julien,

Someone was asking me recently, and maybe you know the answer: How to people interact with ParaView when running in Cave mode? Is there any support for head tracking?

Thanks,
-Eric

There's no tracking functionality provided yet. The user is expected
to interact from the client terminal. Of course, the community is more
than welcome to come up with drivers to drive the client using head
tracking devices as an input :).

Someone can write a very simple client using VRPN (
http://www.cs.unc.edu/Research/vrpn) for ParaView.

Eric, do you know the hardware these folks are using for tracking?

Bug 9020 sounds like it is describing the functionality of the programmable source filter.  How is it different?

Does anyone else want to be able to create polygons in Paraview:

I guess this is just a VTK filter thing, so can it be moved to the VTK

I see how I used a confusing example. I was suggesting that there be a

Hey Aashish,

Here is the info I got from David Zielinski, who is the programmer and technical expert on our 6-sided VR cave here at Duke:

> We are using an intersense is-900. We currently have both VRPN and trackd installed.
> 
> Also, for stereo cameras in VR to work correctly they need to be drawn using asymmetric frustums.
> http://www.orthostereo.com/geometryopengl.html

So, it looks like he commonly uses VRPN as an interface layer to both the head tracker and a wand. Since ParaView supports some sort of Cave mode, I guess we're curious about some aspects of how things are done and what already exists (or could be written):

1. Is the stereo viewing in Cave mode done with asymmetric frustums?
2. Could a client be built to change the viewpoint based on the head tracker?
3. Is it possible to also take in the wand data to change the view or manipulate widgets?

Thanks for the help,
-Eric

I will let Julien or Utkarsh answer this. I didn't look at the
implementation yet.

I think this should not be difficult. Specially since IS900 configuration is
not that hard and lot of things are taken care by VRPN already.  Actually
you just need eye position for head tracking (unless you want to use
orientation information for something else).

Using the pvx file, you have control over your cameras (relative position +

Right now, the client can change the viewpoint based on mouse events, I

You can handle any ParaView object on the client side.

Subject: [Paraview] Reloading plugins after recompiling them
Message-ID: <z2jc19fcadc1004281406k5b8419d7v2b15f1bcc65dcd96@mail.gmail.com>

Consider that I have built a .so plugin (call it vtkTest).

- I have the vtkTest plugin loaded in Paraview
- Then I make a change to vtkTest.cxx and recompile the plugin .so
- I go to Tools -> Plugin Manager
- Select vtkTest and click "Remove"
- Click "Load New"
- Select the new vtkTest.so
- Attempt to run the filter

It seems to use the OLD version of the filter. If I restart Paraview
and then load the plugin, the new version is used.

Does anyone else have this problem?

Thanks,

David

unloading a plugin from memory and reloading it is not supported (and probably never will be)

Restart pv to reload the plugin

"Remove" doesn't unload a plugin, it simply removes it from the list.
In fact unloading a plugin is not supported (and won't be supported
anytime soon). You've have to restart ParaView.

Remove just removes it from the menu, it does not remove the library
from the running process. To remove the plugin you have to
subsequently quit ParaView and restart.

Removing the library at run time like you want is not on the
forseeable horizon. My understanding is that once the symbols from the
library are loaded they are inextricably entwined with the running
process.

Hi Utkarsh,
Here is what I mean by missing domain information.
If you can try to load the xmf file in 3.8.0RC-1 and 3.6.2, you can that 
only 3.6.2 can reveal there are four domains for this data set.
Thanks a lot for the help.

Best,
x

Thanks. I just tired it and it seems to work. But how does the writer figure
out the input object?

Is there any detailed documentation on pvpython?

Thanks,

You can read about python scripting in paraview here:

http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Python_Scripting

Paraview has the concept of an active source.  Making a source the active
source in python is like selecting it in the gui.  For all operations, if no
input is specified, the active source is used.  You can get the active
source with GetActiveSource().  When you create a new object, like
TrivialProducer(), it becomes the active source.

When creating a new source (or writer), you can specify the input(s)
explicity using arguments to the constructor.  Or you can specify a Input
keyword argument that takes a list.  Such as:

AppendDatasets(source1, source2)
 or
AppendDatasets(Input=[source1, source2])

I have read that, but wonder if there is any more detailed and systematic

Thanks for you help Shree/Philippe

I am also working with VirtualGL (though I only have it working in the basic
configuration). Eventually the intention is to allow remote viz.

In the above are you talking about ParaView 3.8 RC with GPU acceleration
used i.e. comparing VirtualGL GPU rendering to ParaView GPU rendering? Or as
it reads with ParaView rendering in CPU (no GPU acceleration).

I know that pvserver uses the GPU because it fails to render if the correct
driver isn't present. Our system has all NVIDIA nodes - the ParaView 3.8 RC
GPU acceleration is far far quicker than software rendering. My impression
is that ParaView in parallel with GPU acceleration would be the fastest
solution.

Cheers,

Would someone please log the bug  bug.

I would like to do this myself, but I'm having difficulty logging into 
mantis. The first time I tried to create an account, I got no response 
(perhaps the system did not like my number-heavy email address). Now 
mantis tells me that my address is use. I've ask for my password but 
none was mailed to me.

Subject: [Paraview] Writing Raw Files
Message-ID: <4BD95173.5050507@rwth-aachen.de>

Hi!

In Paraview, you can read raw files for which you have to provide the 
scalar type, extents, ... This is great since raw files are perfect 
candidates to exchange data between different software. However, I was 
not able to find a Raw-Writer...? The mhd writer produces zraw, which 
isn't as portable anymore. I am about to write a new vtk-plugin / use an 
existing one since I can't seem to find another way.
I am probably just not looking hard enough but if saving plain raw files 
isn't a basic feature this should really be implemented in the future.

Best regards,
Christian

When upgrading ffmpeg to svn22965 or newer, ParaView git master does not
compile against it any more. The ffmpeg commit in question is revision

The issue, a remedy and the motivation of the ffmpeg developers has been
reported e.g. on
http://lists.links2linux.de/pipermail/packman/2010-April/008352.html

I guess VTK/CMake/vtkTestFFMPEG.cmake needs to be patched to somehow add
-D__STDC_CONSTANT_MACROS to compile flags in order to be able to use the
latest ffmpeg version.

Is it possible to show/hide the center of rotation from python?
and the orientation axes?

Nothing appears on the trace when they are toggled...

X,

The support for choosing a domain was dropped in 3.8. There are undue
complications in the reader that result from having multiple domains
and in practice most users ended up using multiple grids in the same
domain. If multiple domains is something you'd like to have supported,
please feel free to add it to the bug tracker (
http://paraview.org/Bug ).

Hi,

I have successfully tested the Ensight Format from CFX solver.
First, open the CFX 12 solver.
In "Tools" menu select "Export Results" to load your ".res" file.
Then choose "Ensight" Output Format.
You can keep binary files in Ensight Gold version it is well supported by
ParaView.

Hope this helps,

Regards

Thanks to all of you for your helpful information. 

I'll have to talk about this more with David and my boss to see what they think about trying to move forward with looking at ParaView in our VR setup. I'll have them look over the information you've provided and see what they think.

Thanks again, and I'll talk to you later,

The problem with ffmpeg IMHO is that it is a moving target (as is also declared on their website). It is almost impossible for ParaView to keep up and just arbitrarily picking any revision is no solution either, because that will cause a lot of trouble for packagers.

<shameless_plug>I suggest you give the included Ogg/Theora writer a try.</shameless_plug>.

Subject: [Paraview] Extract Block from MultiBlock into vtkImageData
Message-ID: <FB2AA04D-A3A4-405B-9DE9-22985B1FC94F@bluequartz.net>

Is there a pipeline that would allow me to extract a block from a  
MultiBlock data set and end up with the "native type" of vtk object  
that the block represents?

I have a custom reader that reads data from an HDF5 file and outputs  
vtkMultiBlockDataset. I then use the "ExtractBlock" filter to pull out  
a specific data set. The type of data is a Uniform Rectilinear Grid  
that is store in the block. After the ExtractBlock the extracted data  
is still listed as MultiBlock. I then run some filters (Extract  
Surface) that generates PolyData. I would now like to "AppendDatasets"  
but the filter is not available because I am assuming that the filter  
does not like the vtkMultiBlockDataset that are produced from all the  
other steps.

   I am thinking of a filter such that the input is a  
MultiBlockDataset and the output is a vtkImage, or vtkPolyData or  
something like that.

Thanks for any help.

this is on ParaView 3.8.0 RC1, OS X 10.5.8, Qt 4.6.2 Cocoa.

Message-ID: <w2wc9adba421004290809t1d3e85dbub5e24932c182a47@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have this in my XML:

<IntVectorProperty name="Items" command="AddItems"
clean_command="RemoveAllItems" repeat_command="1"
number_of_elements_per_command="1">
    <EnumerationDomain name="array_list">
        <Entry value="1" text="item 1"/>
        <Entry value="2" text="item 2"/>
        <Entry value="3" text="item 3"/>
    </EnumerationDomain>
</IntVectorProperty>

The problem I have is that I don't know how to set the items in python by
their name.  instead I need to call:

filter.Items = [1,2]

rather than:

filter.items = ['item 1', 'item 2']

This seems work work automatically for single items (such as with the mesh
quality filter).  Is this just not implemented for lists or have I done
something wrong?

Thanks in advance,
Paul

Message-ID: <4BD9A3E8.2030001@ohiou.edu>

I just tried an experimental build on bubbles with testing done in
parallel. This is the result :

http://www.cdash.org/CDash/viewTest.php?onlyfailed&buildid=597827

I did another test without the dreaded
PV_TEST_INIT_COMMAND:STRING=killall -9 pvserver;... line but the results
weren't much better.

http://www.cdash.org/CDash/viewTest.php?onlyfailed&buildid=597827

The solutions I can think of are to set the RUN_SERIAL CTest property
for these tests or to adjust the ports used for these tests.

You are correct, it's not implemented. We didn't think of enumeration
values being lists. Feel free to add a feature request.

Yes you are exactly right. All of those tests unfortunately use the same
port (11111).

Michael,

> The problem with ffmpeg IMHO is that it is a moving target (as is also declared on their website). It is almost impossible for ParaView to keep up and just arbitrarily picking any revision is no solution either, because that will cause a lot of trouble for packagers.

It's just that PV and VTK for a month or three now supported both the old
outdated ffmpeg version from February 2007 or so (downloadable as a tarball from
the addons section of the VTK software download website) AND the latest ffmpeg.
Up to last Monday. Given the effort spent to re-add support for newer ffmpeg
versions and considering that the change in ffmpeg that breaks it this time in
PV is less complex to work around than last time (headers completely reworked),
I think we shouldn't let go that easily.

I'm well aware of your contribution and compile ParaView with
  -DVTK_USE_OGGTHEORA_ENCODER:BOOL=ON -DVTK_USE_FFMPEG_ENCODER:BOOL=ON
ever since you announced your git fork of PV on this mailing list, so even
before ogv support has been added to the official source tree. :-)  It's just
that some of my users prefer avi over ogv.

Hey Mike,

Hopefully someone else has a "real" filter that will do this, but in the meantime I think you can do what you want with a Python Programmable Filter. Set the output to the type you want, and put something like this in the script:

pdi = self.GetInputDataObject(0,0)
block0 = pdi.GetBlock(0)
pdo = self.GetOutputDataObject(0)
pdo.ShallowCopy(block0)

FYI, It is on my todo list to

1. restore dash16 to build VTK against the old FFMPEG
2. potentially setup a new dashboard that builds against at least a more
recent version.

OK, I have to agree there. But unless ffmpeg changes their development model, keeping up with them will always be a PITA... That's one of the reasons why I created the VTKOggTheoraWriter (and, of course, the licensing/patents issues).

Cool. BTW, does anybody here know how to reliably encode a movie for embedding in PowerPoint slides? I once found a way to transcode with ffmpeg, but that didn't work the last time I tried (although all the .avi files I created with the supposedly correct codec choice played fine in MediaPlayer...) The only thing that worked was to open the thing in MovieMaker and export it as a PowerPoint movie from there. It's beyond me why PowerPoint can't just embed and play about any format+codec that MediaPlayer accepts when it is using the MediaPlayer components in the first place!

Perhaps a dashboard which always checks out the most recent version of ffmpeg and tries to build against it? Would it be worthwhile to offer the user the choice of downloading and building the most recent ffmpeg (and perhaps also the last known-to-work revision) as an ExternalProject?

I've used these to convert a set of png's saved by PV, it's the second 
line that makes the MS compatible movie.

fmpeg -loop_output 0 -qscale 1 -r 20 -b 9600 -i tpar.%04d.png tpar_vr.mp4
ffmpeg -i tpar_vr.mp4 -qscale 1 -vcodec msmpeg4v2 -acodec mp3 -mbd rd

Hi,

I'd like to suggest the attached patch as a starting point. It gets PV compiled
again against ffmpeg svn head. On 32 and 64 bit Linux and 64 bit Solaris systems
I did not observe any side effects yet (using gcc only to compile PV, though).

Thanks Julien.

Just out of interest - has anyone attempted writing a reader for the format?
 Or, does anyone have any documentation on the format?

Thanks,

Hi all!

I'm bringing this thread back- I have learned a couple new things...

-----------------------
No more orphans:

Here is an easy way to create an orphan:

   $ ssh localhost sleep 1d
   $ <press control c>

The ssh process is cleaned up, but sshd orphans the sleep process.  You can
avoid this by adding '-t' to ssh:

  $ ssh -t localhost sleep 1d

Works like a charm!  But then there is another problem... try this command
from paraview (using QProcess) and it still leaves an orphan, doh!  Go back
and re-read ssh's man page and you have the solution, use '-t' twice: ssh
-tt

-------------------------
GatewayPorts and portfwd workaround:

In this scenario we have 3 machines: workstation, service-node, and
compute-node.  I want to ssh from workstation to service-node and submit a
job that will run pvserver on compute-node.  When pvserver starts on
compute-node I want it to reverse connect to service-node and I want
service-node to forward the connection to workstation.  So here I go:

   $ ssh -R11111:localhost:11111 service-node qsub start_pvserver.sh

Oops, the qsub command returns immediately and closes my ssh tunnel.  Let's
pretend that the scheduler doesn't provide an easy way to keep the command
alive, so I have resorted to using 'sleep 1d'.  So here I go, using -tt to
prevent orphans:

  $ ssh -tt -R11111:localhost:11111 service-node "qsub start_pvserver.sh &&
sleep 1d"

Well, this will only work if GatewayPorts is enabled in sshd_config on
service-node.  If GatewayPorts is not enabled, the ssh tunnel will only
accept connections from localhost, it will not accept a connection from
compute-node.  We can ask the sysadmin to enable GatewayPorts, or we could
use portfwd.  You can run portfwd on service-node to forward port 22222 to
port 11111, then have compute-node connect to service-node:22222.  So your
job script would launch pvserver like this:

  pvserver -rc -ch=service-node -sp=22222

Problem solved!  Also convenient, we can use portfwd to replace 'sleep 1d'.
So the final command, executed by paraview client:

  ssh -tt -R 11111:localhost:11111 service-node "qsub start_pvserver.sh &&
portfwd -g -c fwd.cfg"

Where fwd.cfg contains:

  tcp { 22222 { => localhost:11111 } }


Hope this helps!

Hi all,

Dose anyone have any experience in reading meshes (*.node *.ele *.face)
generated with Tetgen in Paraview?

Thanks,

Ken

Hi Pat,

 From my point of view the issue is philosophical, because practically 
speaking I couldn't reproduce the orphans with out doing something a 
little odd namely, ssh ... &&  sleep 1d. Although the fact that a user 
reported suggests that it may occur in the real world as well. The 
question is this: should an application explicitly clean up resources it 
allocates? or should an application rely on the user not only knowing 
that there is the potential for a resource leak but also knowing enough 
to do the right thing to avoid it (eg ssh -tt ...)? In my opinion, as a 
matter of principle, if PV spawns a process it should explicitly clean 
it up and there should be no way it can become an orphan. In this case 
the fact that the orphan can hold ports open is particularly insidious, 
because further connection attempt on that port fails with no helpful 
error information. Also it is not very difficult to clean up a spawned 
process. What it comes down to is a little book keeping to hang on to 
the qprocess handle and a few lines of code called from 
pqCommandServerStartup destructor to make certain it's cleaned up. This 
is from the patch I submitted when I filed the bug report.

+    // close running process
+    if (this->Process->state()==QProcess::Running)
+      {
+      this->Process->close();
+      }
+    // free the object
+    delete this->Process;
+    this->Process=NULL;

I think if the cluster admins out there new which ssh options 
(GatewayPorts etc) are important for ParView to work seamlessly, then 
they might be willing to open them up. It's my impression that the folks 
that build clusters want tools like PV to be easy to use, but they don't 
necessarily know all the in's and out's of confinguring and running PV.

Thanks for looking at this again! The -tt option to ssh is indeed a good 
find.

Hey Mike,

Hopefully someone else has a "real" filter that will do this, but in the meantime I think you can do what you want with a Python Programmable Filter. Set the output to the type you want, and put something like this in the script:

pdi = self.GetInputDataObject(0,0)
block0 = pdi.GetBlock(0)
pdo = self.GetOutputDataObject(0)
pdo.ShallowCopy(block0)

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Hello Eric

The python code above is correct, but an important piece is missing, i.e. setting up the WholeExtent. 

The RequestInformation Script should also contain:

pdi = self.GetInputDataObject(0,0)
exts = pdi.GetBlock(0).GetExtent()
pdo = self.GetOutputDataObject(0)
pdo.SetWholeExtent(exts)

I have applied your patch.  I agree that paraview should explicity close the
child process.  But... what I am pointing out is that calling
QProcess::close() does not help in this situation.  What I am saying is
that, even when paraview does kill the process, any commands run by ssh on
the other side of the netpipe will be orphaned by sshd.  Are you sure you
can't reproduce it?

$ ssh localhost sleep 1d
$ < press control-c >
$ pidof sleep
$ # sleep is still running

Hi Ken,

I think there may be a tetgen reader that we've developed for a different
project.  I may be able to move it to ParaView/VTK but will have to check
with the sponsor.  Could you send a small sample file so that I can make
sure that it's the same file type?

Hey Burlen, on the bug report page for 10283, I think you need to fix the
command line you are testing with :

$ ssh remote cmd1 && cm2

will execute cmd1 on remote and cmd2 locally.  It should be:

$ ssh remote "cmd1 && cmd2"

Subject: [Paraview] Internal volume vs. external surface via python
	interface?
Message-ID: <4BDB0EBA.9010707@slac.stanford.edu>

Hi, Everyone.

I am trying to display a slice from a volume dataset, but when I use the 
python interface, all I get is a slice of the external surface.  Within 
paraview's gui, there is no problem selecting "External Surface" vs. 
"Internal Volume".

I have tried comparing python traces of slicing entire volume vs. 
exterior surface, but the traces are, for all practical purposes, 
identical.  I also tried looking at a trace of changing the slice's 
input, but the trace seems to have no relevant information.

I tried comparing trace state, with no important difference found.   I 
tried comparing saved state (.pvsm) files, but saw no difference there 
except for id kinds of numbers.

I think that ll9cellf523_ncdf (see below) has two output ports, where 0 
is the surface and 1 is the entire volume, but I'm not sure of that.   
 From "Paraview Scripting with Python" (August 2007), page 15, it looks 
like I should be able to:

      Slice1.Input = OutputPort(ll9cellf523_ncdf, 1)

But that gives

     NameError: name 'OutputPort' is not defined

Trying either

     Slice1.Input = ll9cellf523_ncdf.Port(0)
     Slice1.Input = ll9cellf523_ncdf.Port(1)

runs, but the slice is still only slicing the external surface.

My test script is below.

Thanks for any help.

Greg

    Slice1 = Slice( SliceType="Plane" )
    Slice1.SliceType.Origin = [-0.023, 0.0, 0.7]

    DataRepresentation1 = Show()

    view            = GetActiveView()
    view.Background = [1, 1, 1]
    view.ViewSize   = [800, 300]

    WriteImage("test.png")


p.s., I actually want to do something else (use a calculator to get 
efield magnitude, and then plot isocontour surfaces from that), but this 
slice example seemed simplest, and I'm assuming that once that works, 
the other stuff will work in the same way.

Hi, Utkarsh.

According to that example, I changed my script to read

    Slice1 = Slice(Input=servermanager.OutputPort(ll9cellf523_ncdf,1), 
SliceType="Plane" )

And now it works perfectly!

Thank you very, very much.

Yes, that works.  Actually, this might be even better- put this line
anywhere after 'from paraview.simple import *', and before the first call to
Render:

paraview.simple._funcs_internals.first_render = False

I see what you mean. QProcess::close() only closes the ssh process 
spawned by PV, not the other processes spawned by ssh on the remote 
host. & for ssh to clean up after itself on the remote host it needs a 
tty there.

Thanks for the clarification.

yeah, that's a typo in the bug report. Both last night and this morning

Hi Ken,

I'm not familiar with the formats of the files you sent us.  I'm not that
familiar with tetgen either so it's possible that we may be talking about
the same software or we may not.  In any case, the tetgen output grid file
that I have looks like the following at the top:
MESH3D
E4T     1  4913  5569  4914  5530     2
E4T     2  4913  4953  4914  5569     2
E4T     3  4913  4952  5569  5568     2
E4T     4  4913  4952  4953  5569     2
E4T     5  4913  4912  5568  5528     2

The nodes are listed second and look like:
ND     1 1672.1247729534 1357.9324205486 -14.27143712838
ND     2 1580.6340102853 1340.230370113 -3.885760029157
ND     3 1580.6340102853 1340.230370113 -14.12243425846

These are the files that we are able to read.  Does this look like it's from
the same software?

Andy
