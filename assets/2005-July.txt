Subject: [Paraview] XY Plot
Message-ID: <00f501c57e2f$1400b300$41c809c0@jupiter>

Hello all,

I try to use the XY-Plot with Paraview 2.2 under a VTK file with 12 scalar attributes (with domains totaly differents).
So when I add a XY-Plot I have 12 legends and I see only 1 curve (the curve with the greater domains) all the others curve is the line Y=0.

Can I select an scalar attributes to see only one on my XY-PLOT ?
or Can I change the Y scale of the XY-Plot ?
and if yes, how ?

Thank you for your help

This is a bug we are working on.  You should be able to select an
array. Hopefully, it will be fixed in the next patch.

Hello,

The FIELD format is supported by Paraview because I use several others FIELD in my file and if the "symmetry" FIELD isn't present, Paraview read my file without any problem.
The FIELD read are at the beginning of file and the symmetry field is at the end after coordinates, connectivity and point and cell datas.

So I will try to put this field at the beginning with the other FIELD to see if my problem it's an order problem.

Thanks to anybody has a idea about this problem.

Sincerely yours

Subject: [Paraview] Example vtk-formatted unstructured grid data files (*.pvd,
	*.pvtu, *.vtu)
References: <1119988934.42c1acc6c31f9@webmail.colorado.edu>
Message-ID: <023f01c57f78$f3e8a3c0$6e01a8c0@last>

Manuel,

I have attached an example set of vtk-formatted
unstructured grid data files for your use.

The files are serialized in time (...t00n...).
I have used ParaView's parallel read capability
and written files "by-material" (...m00n...) as well.

The *.pvtu files are "mother files" at each time step
that identify the parallel components (in this case,
individual material domains).  ParaView doesn't
know (and doesn't care) that I wrote the respective
material domains as separate files during a single-cpu
serial execution.

The *.pvd files are "mother files" that preserve the
seperate material domains as Parts so that the
material domains (or however you have decomposed
your mesh) can be displayed in any combination
(individually turned "on" or "off") by the Extract Parts
filter. The Collection XML-tag has an undocumented
entry: name="abc...xyz"  If this entry is present, it will
be displayed in the Extract Parts filter's face-sheet,
an invaluable feature if you have a dozen different
items in the Collection.

One of the secrets to using the *.pvt? and *.pvd files
is to make each *.vt? file referenced by these "mother
files"  a self-contained individually displayable file.

Regards,

Sam Key

Hello,

I have a user-defined reader with a time slider and am trying to get it 
to update the time slider if the number of timesteps changes.

There used to be the 'range_source' parameter 
(range_source="TimeStepRange") in the xml file which allowed me to do 
this but this does not seem to be working anymore.

Is there maybe a new way to do these kind of things?

Kind regards,

Mattijs

Message-ID: <D197389E10F83A47AACBFB99E94F9CEB1FBA52@IVITTRN02VEIE01.ivecoeurope.ivecogroup.iveco.com>

Hello,

I am just beginner with Paraview so I have a got question:

Using the contour filter, I am plotting an isosurface of a defined
temperature.
Now, I would like to calculate the area defined by this isosurface and
print it out.

I found out that Integrate Attributes give me the area of the surface
but how
to get such area output in batch mode??

I am simulating internal combustion engine and I would like to build a
file
with the Crank angle vs the area of isosurface T=1500K for example.

Any idea on how to modify the batch file .pvb to get the output??

Reagrds,

gilles

Subject: [Paraview] calling interactive render
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.62.0507061113150.32173@cslab6f>

I'm trying to write a new render module. I am effectively modifying 
vtkPVCaveRenderModule.* to add in head tracking capabilities. Our head 
tracker works on a polling system so that a handler method gets called on 
a regular basis. Everytime this happens I want it to call 
InteractiveRender() on the module to update the camera position. 
In doing this, I lock the render method using a pthread mutex and exit 
the render call if I am already in the process of calling 
InteractiveRender(). However, when I compile and run Paraview, I get a 
series of bizare errors that occur at seemingly random times (they always 
occur early on but after different numbers of callbacks each time it's 
run). Any idea what these are about (the errors are below)?

Yup. Look at the ExodusReader in GUI/Client/Resources/Readers.xml and
Servers/ServerManager/Resources/readers.xml. Let me know if you have
questions.

After spending some quality time with the Integrate Attributes code, I
don't think there is an easy (meaning without writing C++ code) way of
doing this in batch. The data that is needed is all there but is not
exposed to the batch (Tcl) interface.

Hello all,

A VTK file can be read in paraview if all the FIELD are at the beginning of this file.
You can't put a field at the end after coordinates, connectivity, point and cell data.

Yes. On cvs HEAD and last release, you can save it to a csv file. I
believe it is currently broken on 2.2 and should be fixed in the next
patch.

Message-ID: <20050707150457.0734172855@mailhost.nacad.ufrj.br>


Hello all,

Does anybody know how do I go about getting the color scale bar range
adjusted (or animated) accordingly the scene plotted by Paraview at each
time step? For instance, assuming that some property has the maximum value
at the third time step and the minimum at the last, so the range displayed
by the color scale bar must be set according to those values. Up to now,
when you have properties with strong gradients and define the range of the
scale bar at an improper time step you get scenes completely red or blue and
sometimes it's undesirable.

Thanks for any help

pvtk is no longer supported. If you have old .pvtk files, paraview can
still read it but otherwise it is not supported.

Which filter can I use to isolate datasets that are part of the vtkHierarchicalBoxDataSet I've created in my AMR reader?

I.e., is it possible to only display the datasets -- blocks -- I choose to see?

Thanks.

Yes, run the Extract Datasets filter on your vtkHierarchicalBoxDataSet.

The "Extract Datasets" filter (vtkHierarchicalDataExtractDataSets) was 
added to ParaView on June 16.  It operates on vtkHierarchicalDataSets (and 
vtkHierarchicalBoxDataSet is a subclass of vtkHierarchicalDataSet).

If yes, where can I find the vtu file format ?

Subject: [Paraview] TCL/Paraview Wrapping Trickery Question
Message-ID: <42CE70BB.7000600@cscs.ch>

I want to compile a class which can be either an image algorithm or a 
rectilinear grid algorithm.

#ifdef CSCS_BUILD_NETCDF_RECTILINEAR
  #include "vtkRectilinearGridAlgorithm.h"
  #define vtkNetCDFAlgorithm vtkRectilinearGridAlgorithm
#else
  #include "vtkImageAlgorithm.h"
  #define vtkNetCDFAlgorithm vtkImageAlgorithm
#endif

//BTX (because the TCL/Paraview wrapper doesn't like it
class VTK_vtkCSCSNetCDF_EXPORT vtkNetCDFReader : public vtkNetCDFAlgorithm
{
public:
  vtkTypeRevisionMacro(vtkNetCDFReader,vtkNetCDFAlgorithm);
//ETX

compiles fine, but I can't set a conditional TCL wrapping option. I can 
of course create two classes, one Rectilinear and the other image data, 
but for now I want to keep all the code centralized and have a cmake 
option as to which is generated.

Can the TCL wrapper (and Paraview CS wrapper) be tricked (without 
modifying vtkWrapTcl or vtkParse.I etc etc)

10 points to anyone who can tell me how to do it.

cheers

JB
(Of course in the real world I want to output 2 datasets one ImageData, 
the other Rectilinear Grid, but Paraview won't buy it).

What would be the easiest way to write files for paraview in C? is there a 
library (i mean, can I use the c++ librarys of vtk directly?)? and, if 
not, would there be interest in one?

is possible see that the geometry was loaded. I
probably

Berk,
	Given an environment as such:
	a 4-nodes cluster server without graphics card  and a client node with a graphics card,
	paraview-2.0.1 runs in the client/server mode.
	
	My questions are :
	1. what does the renderserver  send to the client?  pixel images for display? Or OpenGL control flows, then the client composites  and translates them to pixel images and displays? 
	2. paraview uses sort-last compositing algorithm, and where does the compositing process occur? on the renderservers or the client?  
	3. If my environment changes and every server node has a graphics card, then what is the answer of question 1 and 2 ?
	
		
 Thanks

There appears to be a naming conflict between
ParaView (2.0.3) and Xorg's X-window server
in Suse Linux 9.3

>From a ParaView "failed" startup I get --
Xlib:  extension "GLX" missing on display ":0.0".

>From the /etc/X11/xorg.conf file I have --
Section "Module"
  Load         "dbe"

  Load         "extmod"
  Load         "glx"
  Load         "v4l"
EndSection

Both files are attached.  My guess at
what may be the trouble is that ParaView
is looking for GLX as the extension name,
and Xorg is using glx as the extension 
name???

Any suggestions on what I should do?

Well I'm not Berk but I may be able to help. :)

1) The servers (renderservers) can either send images or geometry to the
client. If you look under 'View... 3D View Properties' you will see a
slider for Composite. If you move slider to zero megabytes you will
either get images streaming down from the servers or you will get a
crash. 

If you get a crash it means that you servers are not set up so that they
can open up X windows. Note that this is a fairly common problem and you
have to have your cluster admin (or yourself) change the X server
security setting to allow you to do this.

2) On the servers. The whole point is not to move the data, so wouldn't
be useful anywhere else. :)

3) Same answers for 1 and 2 but should be much faster when using
compositing on big data. :)

Wylie, Brian,

  Thank you very much.
  And I have another question :)
"1) The servers (renderservers) can either send images or geometry to the
client. If you look under 'View... 3D View Properties' you will see a
slider for Composite. If you move slider to zero megabytes you will
either get images streaming down from the servers or you will get a
crash. "
-- You mean the user decides where the rendering process occurs by 
setting the composite slider?  

  In the page 90 of The Paraview Guide (chapter 12 Parallel ParaView), 
there are some words as follows?
"ParaView has the option of using parallel rendering on the render server 
or rendering directly on the client workstation. ParaView automatically chooses
a rendering strategy to achieve the best rendering performance. Smaller models 
are rendered on the client, and distributed rendering is used for larger models."
-- so, I guess that ParaView's automatic choice is based on the user's decision by 
setting the composite slider. If I move slider to 10 megabytes, the servers send images to the client when the polygonal representation is larger than 10M,  
and send geometry when it is smaller than 10M.  Right?

Well I'm not Berk but I may be able to help. :)

1) The servers (renderservers) can either send images or geometry to the
client. If you look under 'View... 3D View Properties' you will see a
slider for Composite. If you move slider to zero megabytes you will
either get images streaming down from the servers or you will get a
crash. 

If you get a crash it means that you servers are not set up so that they
can open up X windows. Note that this is a fairly common problem and you
have to have your cluster admin (or yourself) change the X server
security setting to allow you to do this.

2) On the servers. The whole point is not to move the data, so wouldn't
be useful anywhere else. :)

3) Same answers for 1 and 2 but should be much faster when using
compositing on big data. :)

 Subject: [Paraview] Berk, help me plz
 
 Berk,
 	Given an environment as such:
 	a 4-nodes cluster server without graphics card  and a 
 client node with a graphics card,
 	paraview-2.0.1 runs in the client/server mode.
 	
 	My questions are :
 	1. what does the renderserver  send to the client?  
 pixel images for display? Or OpenGL control flows, then the 
 client composites  and translates them to pixel images and displays? 
 	2. paraview uses sort-last compositing algorithm, and 
 where does the compositing process occur? on the 
 renderservers or the client?  
 	3. If my environment changes and every server node has 
 a graphics card, then what is the answer of question 1 and 2 ?
 	
 		
  Thanks
 	
 
 	Wang

Correct. ParaView decides "automatically", it just needs some help :-)

Hi Ricardo,

Take a look at these previous messages on the ParaView mailing list.

http://public.kitware.com/pipermail/paraview/2005-June/001671.html

Yes, you can use VTK's library files in your own program to write .pvtu files.

Subject: [Paraview] Problem after loading a *.vtu file
Message-ID: <20050710230102.32519.qmail@web31211.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

    I have a problem after loading a *.vtu file using
Paraview, I can not visualize the geometry of the file
using surface or wire options. The wires image is a
complete mess. Only when using points of the surface
is possible see that the geometry was loaded. I
probably
have a bug in the data file. So, I annexed it to this
message. If someone could take a look and tell if
there is anything wrong with it, I would be gratefull.
I
went over many times and do not see any problem.

Thanks,

Manuel.

ParaView does not specify which X extension to get by name. This is
done by the GL library paraview is linked to. It is possible  that
there is a difference between the libraries the paraview binary is
linked against and the ones specified in Suse. In this case, you have
to compile paraview from source on that platform.

Subject: [Paraview] vtkUniformGrid::SetDimensions(int[3])
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.58.0507111029190.24237@shakey.mcs.anl.gov>



In the 07/07/2005 CVS distribution of paraview, SetDimensions is no longer
defined in vtkUniformGrid, but it still is in vtkImageData.

Though it should not be a problem, I'm getting an undefined reference (see the
error statement, below) for it in a statement in which I call it as
uniform_grid_pointer->SetDimensions.  The library that includes the call is
"libFlashVTKComponents.so".  Here's the block where it's called:
   func(vtkUniformGrid* ug){
   int celldims[3];
   if (dataset.GetDataLocation() == LocPoint) {
      ug->SetDimensions(celldims);
   } else if (dataset.GetDataLocation() == LocCell) {
      for (int i=0; i<3; i++) {
      celldims[i]++;
   }
      ug->SetDimensions(celldims);
   }
   }

I'm calling it with the correct argument.

And, the libraries appear in the link statement in the correct order for
resolving this (see the link statement below).

Should the function still be defined in vtkUniformGrid?

Thanks.

Randy Hudson.

This is weird. vtkUniformGrid is now a subclass of vtkImageData and it
should inherit SetDimensions() from superclass. Am I missing something
here?

Subject: [Paraview] xlib error
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.62.0507111610410.13177@cslab8b>

Recently I have been trying to call InteractiveRender() in a new render 
module I've been writing. In turn, it's been giving me the following 
error:

Xlib: unexpected async reply (sequence 0x4b)!

I also discovered that I can get the same error by calling Render() on a 
vtkRenderWindow after start() has been called on a
vtkRenderWindowInteractor that contains the aforementioned 
vtkRenderWindow.

Any ideas on what this is about, and how I can call InteractiveRender in 
my module?

Subject: [Paraview] Problem after loading a *.vtu file
Message-ID: <20050711203309.84470.qmail@web31202.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

I have a problem after loading a *.vtu file using
Paraview, I can not visualize the geometry of the file
using surface or wire options. The image using wires
is a complete mess. Only when using points of the
surface
is possible see that the geometry was loaded. I
probably have a bug in the input data file. The file
can be read using the following link:
http://www.geocities.com/manuel_n_d_barcelos_jr/nozzlefld0.txt
If someone could take a look and tell if there is
anything wrong with it, I went over many times and do
not see any problem.

Thanks,

Manuel.

Hi Manuel,

You are the only one who is going to be able to debug your data 
file.  From looking at your file, it looks like you have a 
tetrahedral mesh.  Is this supposed to be the case?  I did load your 
data file into ParaView, and it looks like the problem is with your 
connectivity array; this array is an index into the data array for 
the point coordinates.  The indices for the points in each 
tetrahedron are listed one after the other, one tetrahedron at a 
time.  Do you have your data in another format where you can look at 
how the points are supposed to be connected?  If you have not already 
done so, take a look at http://www.vtk.org/pdf/file-formats.pdf; it 
explains the file formats in VTK (which ParaView uses).

FYI, I never solved this.  I got around it by using the other (three-int-argument) form of SetDimensions(), which allowed the link to finish.

The paraview distributions from both 07/07 and 07/11, which I built on my Windows XP laptop, failed almost immediately upon starting.  This happens whether I run "paraview.exe" or "pvclient.exe".  (These are the two I use on my laptop.)

I did not have this problem under Linux (at least for the 07/11 dist.).

Here is the trace from one of them from Vis Studio:

Hi Randy,

This looks like an error we saw here recently.  Most likely, you have 
a #LookmarkMacros# and/or a #ParaViewlmk# that is completely empty in 
your $HOMEPATH directory (probably C:).  These are XML files 
associated with lookmarks (a fairly recent addition to ParaView).  If 
you delete the file(s), everything should run properly 
again.  Lookmarks are still under development, and we have asked the 
person working on them to correct the problem we (and now you) have seen.

- Amy

FYI:  The 2.2 release binaries died with a stack overflow on startup on 
Jean's laptop here - but worked on my desktop. a cvs update and build on 
my desktop died with the same stack overflow on my desktop, but a clean 
checkout and built on the 2-2 branch worked ok (on the desktop). Some 
problem when creating the gui widgets triggering events recursively 
during creation it seemed like. No idea why it worked and failed on 
differnt machines. (all XP. Linux seems to be ok)

Amy,

I found a #LookmarkMacros# and deleted it, but another one was created when I ran pvclient.  And, the app failed.

OK.  Then try adding the following line to the empty #LookmarkMacros# file.

</LmkFile>

Yes, because vtkXMLDataElement is in ParaView/VTK/IO.

There was a typo in the line I asked you to add to your 
#LookmarkMacros# file.  The "/" was in the wrong place.  It should 
instead be as follows.

<LmkFile/>

Is the #ParaViewlmk# file also empty?  If so, add the same line -- 
<LmkFile/> -- to it.

Do you mind describing the problem and the solution in a short e-mail
so that we point it to others who have the same problem?
Thanks.

MY DESCRIPTION OF THE PROBLEM:
=============================================================
The paraview distributions from both 07/07 and 07/11, which I built on my Windows XP laptop, failed almost immediately upon starting.  This happens whether I run "paraview.exe" or "pvclient.exe".  (These are the two I use on my laptop.)

I did not have this problem under Linux (at least for the 07/11 dist.).

Here is the trace from one of them from Vis Studio:

THE FIRST SOLUTION SUGGESTED:
=============================================================
This looks like an error we saw here recently.  Most likely, you have a #LookmarkMacros# and/or a #ParaViewlmk# that is completely empty in your $HOMEPATH directory (probably C:).  These are XML files associated with lookmarks (a fairly recent addition to ParaView).  If you delete the file(s), everything should run properly again.  Lookmarks are still under development, and we have asked the person working on them to correct the problem we (and now you) have seen.

- Amy


RESULT:
=============================================================
I had the empty #LookmarkMacros# in my "C:/Documents and Settings/<userid>" directory, but not #ParaViewlmk#.  Deleting it did not work, and it was created again when I ran pvclient.


THE SECOND SOLUTION SUGGESTED:
=============================================================
Add the line , "<LmkFile/>", to the empty #LookmarkMacros# file.


RESULTS:
=============================================================
That worked, but now there WAS an empty #ParaViewlmk# file and pvclient died a bit further on.


SUCCESS:
=============================================================
After adding the line , "<LmkFile/>", to the empty #ParaViewlmk# file, pvclient ran.

I'm now playing with this new filter.

What would be outstanding would be a way to extract or visualize just the leaves.

Is that in the offing?

	MY DESCRIPTION OF THE PROBLEM:
	=============================================================
	The paraview distributions from both 07/07 and 07/11, which I
built on my Windows XP laptop, failed almost immediately upon starting.
This happens whether I run "paraview.exe" or "pvclient.exe".  (These are
the two I use on my laptop.)
	
	I did not have this problem under Linux (at least for the 07/11
dist.).

Are you sure that there is no old vtkUniformGrid header file that is 
getting picked up?  That would cause the linker to look for the method 
in vtkUniformGrid instead of vtkImageData.

Closure: As suggested by Philip Sackinger, Sandia, I
used xdpyinfo to discover that "GLX" was not currently
an available extension.

I went into Yast (Suse Linux's system management tool)
and discovered that 3D Hardware was disabled for the
graphics card. I enabled 3D hardware and rebooted.
Rerunning xdpyinfo showed that "GLX" was now an
available extension. ParaView runs just fine now.

Hello Berk,

I just test the last CVS version, the csv file are Ok. Thank you

Just 2 suggestions to ameliorate the lisibility of this file.
 - Add in the first line the point position along the line (point 1 =
position 0.0)
 - Add in each line the label before the first value

O.K.  I think that the CMake file for part of my reader HAD BEEN referring to the VTK headers of an older version of paraview.  I just verified that it now refers to the new paraview release, changed my reader source back to use SetDimensions(int[3]), and rebuilt paraview.  Now it's fine.

My faith in Aristotle's Law of Non-contradiction has been restored.

My custom paraview GUI last worked w/ paraview 2.0.0.

I just tried to build it into the CVS distribution I downloaded on 07/11, and the following error messages were printed:

If any of these classes have been renamed, what are the new names?

Which ones, if any, have been discontinued, and what do you recommend I use in their place?

Hi paraviewers,

I know this has been asked before but google and searching the vtk archives 
does not give me
the answer I want so here goes...

I have a series of time step files and I want to animate over the file 
names. I am using paraview
2.0. How does one do this. You used to be able to do it from the animation 
panel but that
interface has changed. It is now keyframe animation. My files are cleverly 
named file0.vtk through
file1600.vtk. They are the old style file format. Paraview reads them just 
fine but I cant animate
over the file names like I used to. Anyone else done this before?

Thanks
Dave

Dave,

After you read and "Accept"ed one VTK file click on "Timesteps" to make 
sure the right-hand list shows all your timesteps. The reader's "Timestep" 
slider should allow you to manually change to any of your timesteps. If 
this looks good PV knows about all your timesteps.

Then, in the animator tracks, expand the reader's options until you get 
down to the "Filename" track. This track actually only changes the timestep 
index but the effect is animation over the filenames.

This lets me animate over several hundred *.vtu files so I would think it 
will work for your *.vtk files.

Kent

Kent,

Thanks for the reply. I opened one file ( file0.vtk) and then clicked on 
the timestep button. It
only showed me the one time step. Any idea why it does not see the rest? Do 
I have to name
them in some particular way?

Subject: [Paraview] Widgets Reset when Change Source
Message-ID: <4DA120227EA9FAF60AEC5C4D@harpo.psc.edu>

When changing the property sheet from, say, 3D view to cut plane, the 3D 
widget used to move the cut plane is reset, loosing whatever brilliant 
changes I had just made. I expected that it would not be reset and that the 
"Accept" button for the cut plane would be green.

How can this be prevented? Or is this a bug?

Other details: version 2.2b, Fedora Core 3, Auto-accept off.

Hey thanks Eric.

With your hints and Ken Eschenburg's help. I was able to animate the file 
names with the Keyframe
animation. I first read the first data set. Then I hit the timesteps button 
to load a few more
time steps. The switch to animation view and add the key frames and select 
the file names
to associate with them. My problem was I did not add the files with the 
timestep button on the
file property sheet so when I added key frames there was only one file name 
to choose from.

Thanks to all who contributed. This forum is a great help to me. I hope to 
contribute to it in
return.
Thanks Again.

On the subject of netCDF. I'm not sure if this is a paraview or a vtk 
problem (I think paraview, becuase my vtk test code doesn't do it).

After loading a file I can get a nice image like this
ftp://ftp.cscs.ch/out/biddisco/vtk/pic_good.jpg

but after interacting, the image goes like this.
ftp://ftp.cscs.ch/out/biddisco/vtk/pic_bad.jpg

by clicking on the reset to view, or reset colour table buttons one can 
usually get itback to a nice image, but I'm not sure what's going on. Is 
this a known bug or something to do with my setup.

thanks

JB

Message-ID: <42DB943A.3000700@poczta.onet.pl>

Hello,

I am going to write a reader for ParaView but before I start
I have to solve a following problem.

Data in my file is organized in a following tree structure:

frame sets
|
+ - frames
     |
     + - cell/point data

User has to select a frame set then a frame and at last
arrays of cell and point data.
For example number of frames is unknown before a frame set
is chosen and whenever a different frame is chosen, available
data arrays may change too.

The problem is that I don't know how to organize widgets in a way
they get updated according to user's choices.

Of course in a single call to RequestInformation of VTK object,
all information cannot be obtained.

I tried to achieve something by playing with RequiredProperty tag
but I wasn't successful. I couldn't find a solution in
VTK/ParaView books.


I'd appreciate any suggestions.
Thanks in advance.

Hello all,

Does anybody have an idea about how I can "serialize" a parallel domain and
the results associated?

Suppose you have n files, each one with your own piece of an entire domain
and locally numbered accordingly. Thus, I'd like to load the entire geometry
with only one read operation and without having to launch Paraview as mpi
processes or loading n files. Is it possible to do that? If not, how do I
join (which filter) the domain partitions after have loaded my n files with
Paraview?

Thanks for any idea

What platform are you on? Hardware (cpu, memory), graphics card,
drivers, linux kernel? This looks like a driver bug we encountered.

Hello Randy,

I'll answer most of your questions here, Berk will adress the rest. 
Yes, for the most part, classes have been renamed as an undergoing 
effort to clean the KW subdir...

vtkKWCornerAnnotation is now vtkKWCornerAnnotationEditor (to 
emphasize that it's a GUI for the VTK object vtkCornerAnnotation, not 
a specific subclass of vtkCornerAnnotation that was stuck in the KW project)

>/home/hudson/Software/ParaView_CVS_07112005/src_flashgui/GUI/Client/vtkPVFlashCutWidget.cxx:82:31:

Same rational here, vtkKWTextProperty is now vtkKWTextPropertyEditor, 
to clarify what it does (as opposed to a subclass of vtkTextProperty).

>/home/hudson/Software/ParaView_CVS_07112005/src_flashgui/GUI/Client/vtkPVFlashCutWidget.cxx:34:31: 
>vtkKWLabeledFrame.h: No such file or directory

vtkKWLabeledFrame is now vtkKWFrameWithLabel, this was done recently 
to try to reach a uniform naming convention for the KW package (i.e. 
vtkKWFooWithBar, as in vtkKWCheckbuttonWithLabel, or vtkKWFrameWithScrollbars)

>/home/hudson/Software/ParaView_CVS_07112005/src_flashgui/GUI/Client/vtkPVFlashCutWidget.cxx:43:35: 
>vtkKWWindowCollection.h: No such file or directory

This is gone, we got rid of all old containers in the KW subdir, in 
favor of the STL (which is something we are trying to do when 
possible). You can check how it is done in vtkKWApplication (search 
for WindowsContainer).

>/home/hudson/Software/ParaView_CVS_07112005/src_flashgui/GUI/Client/vtkPVFlashCutWidget.cxx:73:23: 
>vtkString.h: No such file or directory

vtkString does not exist anymore, many classes in vtkKWCommon have 
been removed to cut dependencies. I moved most (if not all) vtkString 
methods to the KWSys project, in the SystemTools utility class, which 
is now included in VTK (and was included in PV before). If you need a 
string in PV, use vtksys_stl::string. Then check 
VTK-cvs\Utilities\kwsys\SystemTools.hxx.in

Hope this helps

Windows XP SP2 - NVidia Quadro FX 3400. Driver 77.72

It seems from some chatting here, that we also have a very similar 
problem on a linux box with NVidia Quaddro FX 1300 running driver 71.74 
(I think).

The problem is different on the linux box. (Not tried the netcdr reader 
on it yet), but it can be reliably reproduced it seems by taking some 
data, running pointdatatocelldata filter on it and then displaying. The 
cell data looks rubbish. Running celltoPoint again goes back to being ok.

Since the netCDF reader is the first time I've worked with Cell data as 
opposed to point data, it would explain why I'm only seeing it now.
(Any idea which driver version would be stable on win XP - thatt's my 
main test machine right now?)

The paraview rendering pipeline has changed since 2.0.0. Now the rendermodule and displays are server manager proxies. A rough translation between the old rendermodule/part displays and the current rendermodule proxies/and display proxies is as under:

vtkPVRenderModule -- vtkSMRenderModuleProxy
vtkSMPartDisplay -- vtkSMDisplayProxy

My custom paraview GUI last worked w/ paraview 2.0.0.

I just tried to build it into the CVS distribution I downloaded on 07/11, and the following error messages were printed:

If any of these classes have been renamed, what are the new names?

Which ones, if any, have been discontinued, and what do you recommend I use in their place?

Thanks.

Hmmm. The problem we are seeing is with Linux drivers on 64 bit
machines (EMT), not on Windows. Cells seem to get random alpha values.
What happens when you turn off immediate mode rendering? Also try
changing the value of "Interpolate Colors" (which switches between
using 1D texture maps and using OpenGL interpolation).

Well done. That fixed it. Looks fine now. Pity I didn't think of trying

Actually.
ImmediateModeRendering Checked gives dodgy image
ImmediateModeRendering UnChecked gives nice image, at least I can rotate 
it now and see the data without the problem from before.

No that didn't help. but I'll stick to ImmediateModeRendering off for now.

Just for curiosity, I ran cellDataToPointData filter on it and the 
prblem goes away - so it is just a cell data issue it seems.

cheers

This is not a bug. You have to accept before you leave the property
page otherwise the page is reset. This is to prevent the property
pages getting too much out of sync from the actual values.

I can't remember exactly how this is done but exodus reader does it.
Look at the reader xml files and check out the exodus reader.

Subject: [Paraview] Noise after use of a clipping box
Message-ID: <42DBE0CC.7050406@cea.fr>

Hi all,

I try to clip an unstructured grid (layers on a sphere) with a box.
I was expecting clean planes from the clipping planes
defined by the different faces of the box, but I get some noise
(small cells along the vertex of the clipping box)

Is there an explanation to this ?

See the image at

The vtk file used to produce this is available at:

Berck,
	As you know, the MPI rank of each application instance is very
important when using paraview/ICE-T with a big display.  (If it is
wrong, the display can look like a mixed-up sliding block puzzle...) 

We are working on making HP's SVA/XC clusters work more smoothly with
Paraview, and I have some questions about how you currently use Paraview
with MPI on other types clusters. 

Questions: 
1) What MPI mechanism do you/your customers use when launching the job
to make sure that the proper nodes have proper ranks? 

(From the online examples that I've found
(http://www.cacr.caltech.edu/~slombey/asci/paraview/)  it looks as if
the "-machinefile" parameter to mpirun is used.)

2) Which versions of MPI do you/your customers use? From which vendors? 

...
I am trying to convince some of our developers to tweak things to make
it easier to launch paraview, so your answers would be greatly
appreciated. 

BTW.  If other people on the list are using MPI and would also like to
answer, I would also appreciate it. 

Thanks in advance,
--Phil

I don't see anything special in xml section for exodus reader.
I can't find source od this reader on web, only notice about
export restrictions.

But thanks anyway.

This concerns not only the 07/11 CVS distribution of paraview, but, if I remember aright, paraview 2.0.0.

The stat call is returning an error for files larger than 2GB.  Here's the error message I get:  
Process id: 0 >> ERROR: In /home/hudson/Software/ParaView_CVS_07112005/src_flashgui/Servers/Filters/vtkPVServerFileListing.cxx, line 230 
vtkPVServerFileListing (0x8cfd470): Cannot stat file "/home/hudson/Data/tomek_07152005": Value too large for defined data type 
I'm setting the CMake parameter, "HDF5_ENABLE_LINUX_LFS" to "ON", but this problem comes before HDF5 is used.

There's no other CMake parameter with which to cause paraview to use LFS.

I had to google this. It turns out 64 bit support has to be enable to
work with files larges than 2 GB. For this, these should be added to
compile lines:
-D_LARGEFILE_SOURCE -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64

Try changing CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS and CMAKE_C_FLAGS and recompiling
paraview (wipe out all object files first).

Thanks.

Since there is a CMake parameter for activating LFS for HDF, can you folks add one for paraview in general when you get a chance?

Patrick,

the trouble is that the clipping code in vtk/paraview does an 
calculation of the distance of each point on the cell (8) to the box 
surface - and then insterts triangles where the sign changes - this 
means that along the edge, you get this rounding off artefact that you 
can see where the corner of the box has been missed. The correct result 
would mean creating an L shaped kind of boundary cell where the outside 
was the original data and the inside was the box edge.

One strategy to get it perfect would be to extract all the cells that 
intersect the clipping bos. Then add all the intersection points/edges, 
do a triangulation in 3D and then remove all the cells on the iside of 
the implicit function.

Messy.

JB

Have you examined pages 177 & 178 of the
ParaView Guide from Kitware?

The abc.pvd file works pretty well for me.

You may try to send to rnelias@gmail.com. Gmail certainly will accept your
large attached files ;-)

...About the solution suggested earlier by berk:

I've tried to apply the "append dataset" filter, as Berk suggested, to two
dataset loaded from Ensight binary files, but I think that Paraview (release
2.2) was only able to join the geometry, not the results. After I have
joined the datasets I've tried to animate the results using the geometry
appended, but this geometry has not inherited the "SetTimeValue" property
from my partitioned datasets.

Any way, thanks a lot for your help.

	4 server nodes and a winxp client node connected via a Gbytes switch 

	paraview ran in c/s mode.
	I started server on node1: mpirun -np 4 pvserver

Message-ID: <42E01544@webmail.ualberta.ca>

Hello,

We've been trying to install Paraview 2.0.3 on Mandreva 2005 without success. 
Everytime we try to build, using OGL and Mesa, or Mangled Mesa, we cannot 
successfully complete the build. We've tried installing vtk libraries 
seperately but that doesnt seem to work. Does Paraview require a decent video 
card? On our computer we have a ATI Rage IIC, which is pretty old. Thanks for 
any help.

Eugene

Whether you can build or not should have nothing to do with the card.
What kind of errors are you getting?

The Paraview GUI is based on Tcl/Tk. For this to happen the 
vtkKWApplication (and subclasses like vtkPVApplication) has to create 
a Tcl interpreter at startup (you can access it using 
GetMainInterp()). The InitializeTcl() function is usually called 
fairly early on by the main() function of the application executable. 
It creates the Tcl interpreter itself, outputs error messages to 
'err' (if any), and uses argv/argc to help Tcl find other 
initialization scripts... This is a pretty "advanced" function that 
you should probably not have to worry too much about, unless you are 
developping your own app based on the PV or KW DLL. If this is the 
case, more simple examples can be found in the 
GUI/Widgets/Examples/Cxx directory.

Well when we first tried to build Paraview, we used OpenGL, and got a mpi 
capable build finished succesfully. However, when we tried to run paraview in 
parallel, we would get however X number of GUIs popping up, where X was the 
number of processors we used in the argument 'mpirun -np X'. Each GUI was 
independant of each other (ie. could load different data sets, etc.), but when 
one was closed, they all closed.
Furthermore, pvserver was not mpicapable, which the Paraview Guide said it 
should be, so we turned to try to use Mangled Mesa. When trying to build with 
that, we got the alot of errors, a sample of which is below:

/tmp/Mesa-5.0.2/lib/libMOSMesa.a(osmesa.o)(.text+0x2140): In function 
`write_rgba_span_rgba':

Hello all

Is there any way to automatically extract all Ensight parts according to the
file is read?
I think it must be done by modifying the behaviour of the Ensights reader
(this reader should call the extract parts filter) but I don't know to do
that... Is it hard to do?

Right now I am outputting an absolute path to the trace file for the file i want to open, a .pvd file.  This is very inconvinient and locks the trace file to that one system, unless you want to change it.  I would like to be able to put a relative path here for the .pvd file, that is relative to the trace file, is this possible? Or is this a bug?

Greetings,
I have been using paraview to display unstructured grid models which are
deformed over time. I am doing this by generating a number of files
representing the entire model at different timesteps and then animating
through the timesteps (as described in ParaView Digest, Vol 15, Issue 28).
My problem is that I am generating Large files and am looking of ways of
reducing their sizes.  My files are of the form: 
 
DATASET UNSTRUCTURED_GRID
POINTS 27 float
0 0 0 1 0 0 2 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 2 1 0
0 0 1 1 0 1 2 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1
0 1 2 1 1 2 2 1 2 0 1 3 1 1 3 2 1 3
0 1 4 1 1 4 2 1 4 0 1 5 1 1 5 2 1 5
0 1 6 1 1 6 2 1 6
 
CELLS 11 60
8 0 1 4 3 6 7 10 9

4 6 10 9 12
4 5 11 10 14
6 15 16 17 14 13 12
6 18 15 19 16 20 17
4 22 23 20 19
3 21 22 18
3 22 19 18
2 26 25
1 24
 
CELL_TYPES 11

12
10
10
7

5
5
3
1
SCALARS MOVE float 1
LOOKUP_TABLE default
1.0
0.2
0.2
0.4
1.1
.......
 
And In each file the CELL_TYPES and CELL information does not change, only
the POINTS data and the SCALAR data do. So is there a way to direct the CELL
and CELL_TYPES headers to read their data from a separate file, thus all the
timesteps can read their CELL and CELL_TYPES data from the same file thus
saving disk space. Anybody know how to do this or have any other
suggestions?
 
Kind regards,

 

Noel

I don't think there currently is a way for legacy vtk format to have 
separate parts. You could define your own format and create your own 
reader (don't know how hard that is though) or maybe there is a built-in 
format that can do this (Ensight?)

As a quick fix you could write binary legacy vtk files. Are a lot 
smaller and read much faster.

Hello list,

The first draft of the Temporal Probe is now in the CVS development 
version. Go ahead an give it a try please. To use it, insert and place a 
point probe as normal. Next, enable the XY plot for the point probe. Use 
the play button on the animation control area to run through the time 
steps. The gathered data at that point will show up in the plot as the 
animation progresses.

cheers,
Dave DeMarle

ParaView uses client/server streams to 
communicate between the client and server(s), so 
the classes that are accessed using these streams 
need to be ClientServer-wrapped.  In answer to 
your previous similar question about Tcl 
wrapping, ParaView's user interface is written 
using a mixture of Tcl and C++; also ParaView 
scripts (state and session files) are written in 
Tcl.  As a result, we need to be able to access 
C++ classes from the Tcl language, so the classes must be wrapped accordingly.

Hello David,

Thank you very much for your email.
I have tested the temporal probe with VTK, VTU files, it's Ok.
I will make other tests but only in september now.

Now just a suggestion for your sagacity : Is it possible to separate
temporal curve and animation ? (for the computation time)
   for exemple : I try to make a temporal curve under 65 vtk files, I was
waiting for more than 5 minutes.

And for information : How the time (X) of the temporal curve are computed ?
first =0, second=1,... ?

Congratulation to the Paraview team !!!

Thanks again,

Subject: [Paraview] Macro test
Message-ID: <011601c591fb$7795ec20$41c809c0@jupiter>

Hello all,

I test the macro in lookmark manager today.
The lookmarks are Ok. (Add, remove, rename) the folder seems to be Ok too.

The macro works if the file on which you apply the macro is the same or is another timestep of the same case.
But in all other cases the view area is stopped, all the interface seems Ok but the view doesn't answer to the command there is no refresh function works.

I make the following test :
- I load a vtu file and save it in legacy vtk file.
- I build a lookmark with the vtu file (cell to point data + clip)
- I build macro with this lookmark
- I apply this macro on the vtk file

It doesn't work, the view area is stopped too.

Best regards,

Currently, this can be done only by editing the script. This is not a
bug. Using a path relative to the tracefiles has it's problems too. In
that case moving the trace file would require moving the data file as
well. I think the best solution is to ask the user to locate the file
if it can't be found (pop-up a file selector dialog maybe).

Subject: [Paraview] About paraview execution flow!
Message-ID: <20050727143425.7013E3A9FC@public.kitware.com>

Dear:
   Paraview runs in stand-alone mode. When we open a pvd file, the method vtkPVWindow::OpenCallback() is called. This then calls vtkPVWindow::OpenWithReader which calls tkPVReaderModule::ReadFileInformation. Within ReadFileInformation method, vtkSMSourceProxy::UpdateInformation() is called. Then Process Module will invoke vtkAlgorithm::UpdateInformation through client-server stream interpreter. At last, vtkXMLReader::ReadXMLInformation are called to read the pvd and vtu files. The data sets which are read are stroed in the vector of vtkInformation.
   Then, when we click the Accept button, the method of vtkPVSource::AcceptCallback is called on the instance of vtlPVSource associated with the current data set. This then calls vtkPVSource::AcceptCallbackInternal which calls vtkPVSource::Accept. Within the Accept method, a display which is added to the render module is be created. The render module will be responsible for rendering.
   Has any wrong with above analysis?
   Any advise and help are appreciated! Hope for your replys!

Possibly.
The animation is tied in to call 
Servers/Filters/vtkTemporalProbeFilter::AnimateInit at the beginning, 
and vtkTemporalProbeFilter::AnimateTick after each timestep updates the 
pipeline. If these can be called by something other than the animation 
system, then plotting can be separated from animation.

Right now X simply indicates the number of temporal samples taken. When 
they are taken is a function of the animation setup (keyframes inserted, 
number of timesteps in input files etc). I'm looking into making the X 
axis more meaningful presently.

Thank you for your detailed description of your problem. I believe the
reason for it is that that macros are currently designed to only be
applied to readers of the same type. So trying to apply a macro made
from .vtk on a .vtu dataset wouldn't work (though it still shouldn't
hang like that).  

I've fixed this so that you can now use macros on reader's of different
types (not just different readers of the same type). We'll see how this
works out.

Hi,

I'm new to paraview. So far I have downloaded the source of paraview-2.0.3 and 
compiled it for RedHat with cmake-2.0.6. (MPI activated)
I don't think that there is any compilation/installation error anymore and I 
can also normaly start paraview, pvserver and pvclient. But I can not start 
"pvbatch <something>.pvb"
I got this error message:
> ParaView error: InitializeTcl failed

 > ...
> This probably means that Tcl wasn't installed properly.

There is are two "init.tcl" in subdirectory of my <ParaviewBuildDir>, but 
pvbatch somehow didn't search in these directories.

I also did some suggestion I can found in mailing list:
1. try to run <ParaviewBuildDir>/Utilities/TclTk/tcl8.4.5/unix/tclsh
    -> I don't know much about Tcl, but I got a promt and can query "exit"
2. run the test "ctest -E ParaView"
   96% tests passed, 3 tests failed out of 79
   The following tests FAILED:
         74 - otherPrint-PVBatch (Failed)
         75 - TestSetGet-PVBatch (Failed)
         76 - PVLocal (Failed)
  
Please help me to fix this problem.

Thanks,
IRene

Hello,

I have the paraview guide for version 1.8. Has the guide been modified up 
to the latest version
of paraview, 2.2 I think? The web site claims only 1.8 compatibility. I 
need to buy another guide.
Mine keeps getting borrowed. If a new version is imminent I will wait, 
otherwise I will buy the
1.8 version.

Changing paraview code to do this is not straightforward for someone
who is not accustomed to the source. Can lookmark macros not be used
for this purpose? It might also be possible to write a tcl script to
do it.

Hi Dave,

We are in the process of updating the ParaView guide, but it will be 
a few months before it is available.  If you need another copy now, 
you should buy the 1.8 one.

Berk,

I mean selecting "scalar" for one of the defined attributes (such as "fill")
and having the clip filter maybe go through the each time step.  I don't
know if it can be done, but have heard that it is possible.


Thank you,

Richard
