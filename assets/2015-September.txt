Subject: [Paraview] PV 4.1.0 how to plot over line for two different
 time step on same figure

Attached state file for ParaView 4.1.0 shows how this can be done
using the can.ex2 dataset including in ParaViewData.

Basically, you need to use a filter that explicitly requests a
specific timestep and then apply Plot Over Line to that filter's
output. I created such a filter using "Programmable Filter". Note the
"RequestInformation Script" and "RequestUpdateExtent Script" for the
ProgrammableFilter. Update the timestep in those scripts to change to
the timestep you're interested in.

Subject: [Paraview] Add texture to obj files
Message-ID: <CAAzJzwXU8O53hZsHnY7GhRaZ-DqbHbcVwFSm6g4Bc7TyJ36K7A@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Paraview enthusiasts: Good day. I?m trying to work an obj file along
with a jpg one, produced by a 3D scanner. I can load the obj file and plot
its mesh, etc., however, I cannot map the jpg texture (colors) into it.
i.e. want to take the jpg stuff and map it onto the mesh from the obj file.
Any suggestion on how to achieve this would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you.
My best, Mart?n

Subject: [Paraview] using python or pvpython with Paraview
Message-ID: <CAACk83rtVpBQSeXD4c_TB9Z9z1f9DxdLHqRask0gqZ+b9tVPAg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

I have been using Paraview for a while with python scripts but every time I
used a script, I used to open paraview, then do tools, python shell and
then run the script.

I want to be able to run the script without opening paraview. I looked at
various forums that told me to update my PYTHONPATH or LD_LIBRARY_PATH with
the directory where I built paraview. But I was not able to get anything
working. I mostly could not find any location where the vtkPythonWrap
directory is located (thats the one the forums kept telling me to look for)

I use MacOS and I just downloaded it and dragged it to the applications
folder. So, I had a couple of questions (both for Paraview version 4.3.1)

1. For MacOS, I have paraview installed in /Applications/paraview2.app/.
How would I proceed to use my python script without opening paraview?
2. In the future, I would like to use it in Linux as well. Would the
procedure be similar to the MacOS case or different?

Any kind of help will be greatly appreciated.

Thank you!

Message-ID: <37142D5FC373A846ACE4F75AA11EA84D21BA6DAA@DITKA.anl.gov>

Hi,

I'm diving into Catalyst and try to build a pipeline in C++ for an simple example code. My use case is the following:
I have a uniform 3D grid (converted into vtkImageData) on which I map a field of double values (wrapped into a vtkDoubleArray).
By looking at the examples I managed to make the adaptor that creates the grid and maps the field on it. Now I would like to build pipelines for 2 scenarios:
- slicing the grid horizontally at a given level, apply a color map, and output the result in a PNG file;
- building an isosurface from the 3d grid (with configurable isovalue) and print the result in a PNG file.
In both cases I don't know which classes to look at in the Doxygen of VTK. Besides, I suppose for the second case there should be some concept of camera position and parameters...

Any hint or examples would be appreciated.
Thanks,

Matthieu Dorier

Hi Matthieu,

I would strongly recommend that you use a ParaView GUI generated Python
Catalyst pipeline script instead of hand-written C++ Catalyst pipeliine to
do what you want. There are a surprising amount of settings required to
output images from VTK. If you want to do that in parallel the complexity
goes up even more due to parallel compositing of the images. Everyone that
I've run across that wanted to avoid Python with their Catalyst
instrumented code quickly changed their mind after trying out the Python
generated scripts. The overhead of using Python really is negligible
compared to a pure C++ description of the Catalyst pipeline. Also, the
Catalyst Live and Cinema output are all driven by Python code as well.

The last and only time I tried doing rendering in parallel in VTK it took
me about 5 days and that was with constantly asking questions from other
people here at Kitware that knew how to do that.

That being said, if after reading this you're still set on doing all of
this in C++ then let us know and we'll see what can be done.

Regards,
Andy

One thing I want to clarify with respect to what Andy said. Figuring out
parallel rendering in VTK is tricky but from ParaView be it C++ or Python,
it is much easier. We are here to provide help.

Having said this, if you think that you will be changing your in situ
functionality regularly, I would also highly recommend the Python route. If
you are planning to build in a relatively fix in situ capability, C++ is a
decent option. I would still recommend getting there through the Python
route.  Once you have everything figured out, we can help convert things to
C++.

Best,
-berk

Yes, I sometimes forget that the C++ pipeline can be done from ParaView
abstractions instead of through VTK. And yes, that will be much easier if
you're looking to generate .pngs. The example that you should look at for
that is at
https://github.com/Kitware/ParaViewCatalystExampleCode/tree/master/CxxPVSMPipelineExample.
The vtkCPPVSMPipeline class doesn't create images but it does create a
slice filter and then writes out the result using the parallel XML polydata
writer.

If you want to try that out on your own, I'd suggest looking closely at
that example. If you want to try Berk's suggestion of getting it working in
Python, we can certainly help with converting it to C++.

Hi,

Following your advice I installed the version of Catalyst that includes Python and started trying the examples (https://github.com/Kitware/ParaViewCatalystExampleCode)
I tried the CxxMappedDataArrayExample and the CxxImageDataExample; in both cases I get an error from the script:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 2, in <module>
  File "feslicescript.py", line 78, in DoCoProcessing

  File "/home/mdorier/Catalyst-build/lib/site-packages/paraview/coprocessing.py", line 104, in UpdateProducers
    self.CreatePipeline(datadescription)
  File "feslicescript.py", line 34, in CreatePipeline

  File "feslicescript.py", line 17, in _CreatePipeline
    filename_3_pvtu = coprocessor.CreateProducer( datadescription, "input" )
  File "feslicescript.py", line 20, in Pipeline
    Slice1.SliceType.Offset = 0.0
  File "/home/mdorier/Catalyst-build/lib/site-packages/paraview/simple.py", line 1481, in CreateObject
    elif active_objects.source:
  File "/home/mdorier/Catalyst-build/lib/site-packages/paraview/simple.py", line 1690, in get_source
    self.__get_selection_model("ActiveSources").GetCurrentProxy())
  File "/home/mdorier/Catalyst-build/lib/site-packages/paraview/simple.py", line 1684, in __convert_proxy
    servermanager._getPyProxy(px.GetSourceProxy()),
AttributeError: GetSourceProxy

Any idea what is happening? Are the scripts outdated?

Thanks,

Matthieu

One thing I want to clarify with respect to what Andy said. Figuring out parallel rendering in VTK is tricky but from ParaView be it C++ or Python, it is much easier. We are here to provide help.

Having said this, if you think that you will be changing your in situ functionality regularly, I would also highly recommend the Python route. If you are planning to build in a relatively fix in situ capability, C++ is a decent option. I would still recommend getting there through the Python route.  Once you have everything figured out, we can help convert things to C++.

Best,

Hi Matthieu,

I would strongly recommend that you use a ParaView GUI generated Python Catalyst pipeline script instead of hand-written C++ Catalyst pipeliine to do what you want. There are a surprising amount of settings required to output images from VTK. If you want to do that in parallel the complexity goes up even more due to parallel compositing of the images. Everyone that I've run across that wanted to avoid Python with their Catalyst instrumented code quickly changed their mind after trying out the Python generated scripts. The overhead of using Python really is negligible compared to a pure C++ description of the Catalyst pipeline. Also, the Catalyst Live and Cinema output are all driven by Python code as well.

The last and only time I tried doing rendering in parallel in VTK it took me about 5 days and that was with constantly asking questions from other people here at Kitware that knew how to do that.

That being said, if after reading this you're still set on doing all of this in C++ then let us know and we'll see what can be done.

Hi,

I'm diving into Catalyst and try to build a pipeline in C++ for an simple example code. My use case is the following:
I have a uniform 3D grid (converted into vtkImageData) on which I map a field of double values (wrapped into a vtkDoubleArray).
By looking at the examples I managed to make the adaptor that creates the grid and maps the field on it. Now I would like to build pipelines for 2 scenarios:
- slicing the grid horizontally at a given level, apply a color map, and output the result in a PNG file;
- building an isosurface from the 3d grid (with configurable isovalue) and print the result in a PNG file.
In both cases I don't know which classes to look at in the Doxygen of VTK. Besides, I suppose for the second case there should be some concept of camera position and parameters...

Any hint or examples would be appreciated.
Thanks,

Is there an option so that animating plot over line will use the global max/min values instead of the localo max/min values for each time step? 
animating contours uses the global max/min values and I would like to do this with plot over line. 
Hope my question is clear.

There is no automatic way to do it, but if you scroll down to the bottom of the Properties panel, you will see a checkbox marked "Left Axis Use Custom Range". Check that on and then enter the min/max values.

Hi Matthieu,

What version of ParaView Catalyst did you use? My suggestion would be to
use PV 4.3.1 if you're not using that. It's possible that the examples
haven't been updated for the current PV master. I keep trying to set aside
time to have a dashboard check that nightly but haven't gotten around to do
that yet.

Cheers,
Andy

Hi Andy,

I got the Catalyst source from the dowload page (http://www.paraview.org/download/): paraview version 4.3 (latest stable), Catalyst Editions, last file (Catalyst-base+essentials+extra+renderingbase+python-Source.tar.gz).
The version of python-dev is 2.7 (don't remember the minor version number, I could look it up if necessary).

Thanks,

Matthieu

Hi Martin,

Sure, it's possible. Try this:

- load you OBJ file. Click Apply.
- in the Properties panel, scroll down until you see the Texture option.
Click on the combo box to the right and pick "Load..." Load your JPG
texture.
- if you don't see the texture, change the color array to "Solid Color"

Note that your OBJ file will need to have texture coordinates that get read
into ParaView. I think someone added this capability relatively recently -
let us know if you can't apply the procedure I outlined above.

Hope that helps,
Cory

Subject: [Paraview] bug when opening folder whose name contains an accute
	accent
Message-ID: <CAPhWGfvEDdwJ98Wyks8eAbnM1+Lcpa9890k+Wgw_ct19DiGZgA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

it occurs that folders named using accute accents (?, ?, etc.) do not open
when double clicking on them. Spanish and french-speaking people use that
characters. See the screenshots for more information.


Yes I know. Naming folders in english or without accute accents is easy and
avoids this bug.


But Ubuntu can open that folders, therefore I think Paraview should also be
able to open them.






Greetings from Buenos Aires to everyone using and contributing to this
wonderful application!,

Message-ID: <2d3df13749786f136f47ace40f7851e2@imap.ipgp.fr>

How to extract one face from an hexa in python ?

I have an hexa read from an xmd file. In the ParaView GUI, I use the 
ExtractSurface filter to get the skin of it. Then I select one face. 
Then I use the ExtractSelection filter : I get the face extracted as I 
need (without error message).

OK, now I need to do that with python scripting : if somebody has the 
corresponding code snippet I'd appreciate to get it (filter creation is 
OK. What I don't know is how to select a face from the hexa surface in 
python). I activated "tools / start trace (+ general option : all 
properties)" to get an idea of the python code. When I create the 
ExtractSurface filter, I get :
Traceback (most recent call last):

This crash is maybe related to the ParaView build ? I run Ubuntu-14.04, 
ParaView-4.3.1 has been built from source without any specific / triky 
option (or some basic options like cmake 
-DPARAVIEW_INSTALL_DEVELOPMENT_FILES:BOOL=ON 
-DModule_vtkIOXdmf3:BOOL=ON) : do I have to turn on some option(s) at 
build time to avoid the crash ? I attached the CMakeCache file.

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView in stereo with NVidia 3D Vision
Message-ID: <201509071424.t87EOuJx012545@msw1.awe.co.uk>


Good afternoon everyone,

I have been trying to use ParaView in stereo using NVidia 3D Vision glasses but I am seeing an error. I am using ParaView version 4.3.1 on Linux built using Superbuild.

I have been launching ParaView as follows:

    paraview --stereo --stereo-type="Crystal Eyes"

When ParaView starts I see the following error message:

ERROR: In <path>/build/paraview/src/paraview/VTK/Rendering/OpenGL/vtkOpenGLCamera.cxx, line 167
vtk OpenGLCamera (0x33c9940): failed after Render 1 OpenGL errors detected
  0 : (1282) Invalid operation

Is this a problem with how I am trying to use ParaView, or is it a bug? Is there anything that I can try to get stereo working?

Thanks,
Jim

Most likely its not a bug in ParaView. Seems like a system / configure /
driver issue. Please have a look at this blog on how to set it up:

Hello Jim,
Before spending too much time tracking this down as an error, and just to be sure, are you trying to do this with "3D Vision" or "3D Vision Pro"? The regular 3D Vision does not have OpenGL capabilities and so will not give you stereo. If you are using 3D Vision Pro, then I defer to the ParaView gurus...

Cheers,
Eric

Thanks for the reply Aashish,

I had a look at the link that you supplied, and while my setup is not identical, it is pretty similar to what is described. For information, I am using NVidia 3D Vision (not pro).

Stereo is definitely working on my machine as I can test it with some other software (VisIt & Ensight).

I just tried running a bunch of old versions of ParaView and this is what I see:

ParaView 4.3.1 ? error message, no stereo
ParaView 4.2.0 ? error message, no stereo
ParaView 4.1.0 ? error message, no stereo
ParaView 4.0.1 ? no error, no stereo
ParaView 3.12.0 ? works!

So I am wondering whether the problem is due to a change in build process at my end, or whether it might be a ParaView 4 bug?

Kind regards,
Jim

Matthieu,

I can certainly reproduce the problem with 4.3 Catalyst editions. Let
me track it down. I'll get back to you.

Hi Jim,

Considering the error message you are seeing, I wonder if setting
the VTK_REPORT_OPENGL_ERRORS option to OFF might help.

Thanks,

Subject: [Paraview] Right axis range doesn't appear
Message-ID: <55EE7C5B.7070206@gmail.com>

Hi!

I'm having problems to plot some data in a line chart view depending on 
the bottom-right axes instead of the bottom-left axes (default). The 
issue is that I cannot manually adjust the right axis range since it 
doesn't appear in the Properties tab. Attached to this email you will 
find a screenshot showing this issue.
I tried with Paraview 4.3.1 and Paraview 4.4.0-RC2 and both versions 
have the same problem.

Am I doing something wrong?

Thanks!!

Sergi

Subject: [Paraview] Plot over Line source
Message-ID: <CAKrZ8yc7yUt43ji+rh19wmtxfJwmVEMAJoucuLP5vdgyq1kQ+g@mail.gmail.com>

Hey there

I have some hundred VTU files and I want to plot some data in a graph (Plot
over Line - POL) next to it. The Problem is, the data from these POLs is
coming from a simple log file, basically conaining only x and y values
(like two np.arrays).

I can transform the arrays via

from vtk.util import numpy_support
values = np.array((x,y))
vtk_values = numpy_support.numpy_to_vtk(values, array_type=vtk.VTK_FLOAT)
vtk_values.setName('values_2_show')
vtk_values.setComponentName(1, 'x_value')
vtk_values.setComponentName(2, 'y_value')

But so far I have no success with how to change the input (source)

VTUFILE = FindSource('VTUFILE*')
plotOverLine1 = PlotOverLine(Input=VTUFILE, Source='High Resolution
Line Source')

to a simple array.

Thanks for any help!

Message-ID: <5fc8ae6f.15512.14fac10be07.Coremail.zhz1993622@163.com>

        Hello everyone . Recently, I do some research about parallel rendering . I want to know how paraview do the parallel rendering . Does it use sort last or sort first ,or both .
        I know it use IceT at last . If Icet is a sort last libaray , it should transfer the final pixel to the corresponding node , where  it do this . Or it is a sort first , so every node has all the datas ,and just render the datas corresponding to the screen .
        Also ,i want to know if paraview achieve the loading balance ,and how does this?
        who can tell me these ,thank you very much!
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    zhz

Hi Cory,

Building ParaView with VTK_REPORT_OPENGL_ERRORS makes the error message go away, but still no stereo. The image it plots looks like a regular non-stereo image.

Kind regards,
Jim

Hello Jim,
Before spending too much time tracking this down as an error, and just to be sure, are you trying to do this with ?3D Vision? or ?3D Vision Pro?? The regular 3D Vision does not have OpenGL capabilities and so will not give you stereo. If you are using 3D Vision Pro, then I defer to the ParaView gurus?

Cheers,
Eric

Good afternoon everyone,

I have been trying to use ParaView in stereo using NVidia 3D Vision glasses but I am seeing an error. I am using ParaView version 4.3.1 on Linux built using Superbuild.

I have been launching ParaView as follows:

    paraview --stereo --stereo-type=?Crystal Eyes?

When ParaView starts I see the following error message:

ERROR: In <path>/build/paraview/src/paraview/VTK/Rendering/OpenGL/vtkOpenGLCamera.cxx, line 167

Is this a problem with how I am trying to use ParaView, or is it a bug? Is there anything that I can try to get stereo working?

Thanks,

Hi Richard,

You won't be able to set a vtkDataArray subclass as the input to a
PlotOverLine filter. Instead, you should read the log files in a
Programmable Source, and connect the Programmable Source to the
PlotOverLine filter.

See Chapter 13 of the ParaView Guide [1].

Hope that helps,
Cory

ParaView uses IceT and does sort last compositing. ParaView gives IceT
color and depth buffers from each node, IceT quickly gives us a depth
composited image.

There are exceptions, but in general we do not do anything special with
regards to load balancing. Rather, we read in the data in parallel and keep
whatever partitioning scheme the simulation code that produced it wrote it
in.

Hi,

I'm a little stuck. I was trying to connect our tracking system for a 
large VR wall with ParaView. The tracking runs fine with Avizo from Fei 
(using dtrack), but I wanted to use it for ParaView too. We have tracked 
glasses and a flystick for interaction. The communication of the 
tracking server via VRPN to the client PC works great, with

     vrpn_print_devices DTrack at localhost -trackerstride 100

I can see the two sensors moving and all the buttons that are pressed. 
My tracking config file for ParaView is attached. When I start the 
tracking in ParaView, I see that ParaView connects to the started 
vrpn_server, and I also see a note if the connection is dropped. But 
thats all, I don't see any interaction or changes in my viewport. Am I 
doing something totally wrong? I also tried running it as client/server 
with the same effect of not working.

Thanks for your help!
Cheers from Hamburg ...
Niklas :)

Thanks Ken. I do not see the checkbox. I am using the PV4.1.0 linux binary files downloaded from the paraview web site. Would this be a feature for the windows version?

Matthieu,

There indeed seems to be some issue with 4.3 editions. Since the code
worked as expected with the latest ParaView 4.4-RC2, here's what I did:

1. Created a pull request to update the CatalystExamples code to build with
4.4-RC2 here (https://github.com/Kitware/ParaViewCatalystExampleCode/pull/5).
Once Andy gets a chance to review these, they will get merged in.
2. I've uploaded Catalyst editions for 4.4-RC2 to
http://www.paraview.org/download/. I'd suggest using the 4.4-RC2 editions
along with the build fixes in the above pull request.

Note not all examples will build with the Editions (since the Editions
don't have all the code from ParaView). I verified however that
the CxxMappedDataArrayExample builds and runs with the Rendering-Python
edition that you had selected earlier.

All,

I'm a little uncertain about Programmable Filters with multiple inputs.   I had been assuming that if I had 2 inputs, then inputs[0] is the input that's higher up in the Pipeline Browser, and inputs[1] is the lower input in the Pipeline Browser, but that does not always seem to be the case.     Is there some way to invoke the PF in such a way that I can know which input will be which?

Thanks

Dennis,

That's indeed a problem, currently the order of inputs for the Programmable
Filter is cryptic and inconsistent. I am going to see what I can do to fix
this. It's a major annoyance.

Hi all,

As I haven't yet received a reaction onto my previously reported problem on crashing ParaView when reading EnsighGold *.case files (see email below) I would like to enquire again if no one has a solution to this problem or at least is aware of this as a known bug? 
I would be happy to share my EnsightGold files in order to solve this problem...

Additionally, I have another similar issue where I have again EnsightGold files which hold 5 time steps of a 3D surface mesh whereas for this mesh only the node coordinates but not the mesh connectivity do change over time ("change_coords_only" option in .case file). Even though the ens_checker validates these files successfully, ParaView does not seem to be able to cope with this scenario. 
When loading the .case file the mesh of the first time step is visualized properly. However, when one changes the time to any of the following time steps no more mesh is visible and the statistics inspector reports 0 everywhere (No. of Cells/Points, Memory, etc.).

Any idea on how to tackle these two issues? 
(For me the first issue - in the email below - is the more interesting one)

Thanks a lot for your hints in advance!
Best wishes,
Fab

Subject: [Paraview] Read EnsightGold with different timesteps

Dear all,

In order to nicely visualize a dynamic 3D model I want to use ParaView in combination which EnsightGold (*.case) files. My tetrahedral FE model has a static geometry and only one variable of the elements (scalar per element) is changing over time.

To this end I created three files: (1) example.case, (2) example.geo, (3) example.sigma. The latter is holding all timesteps of the dynamic variable (in my case the conductivity).
Furthermore, I've verified these files using the ens_checker application which concludes with a positive "Hooray! Data format verification SUCCESSFUL with No Warnings".
However, if I load the casefile in ParaView only the first timestep can be visualized. As soon as I change the time to another timestep ParaView freezes (no more reaction and consumes 100% of CPU).

Is it possible that what I want to do using the EnsightGold files is not supported by ParaView?
What else would you suggest me to resolve this problem?

Thank you very much for your help in advance.
Best wishes,
Fab

PS: I am using ParaView 4.3.1 on a Win 7 64-bit machine
PS2: A hint which might be useful for others looking for the ens_checker application: I simply downloaded the current trial version of Ensight, opened the executable of the setup in an archive manager (e.g. 7-zip), located and extracted the ens_checker.exe.

It's an "advanced" property. Simply search for it by name in the Properties
panel or hit the "gear" button next to the search bar to see all the

Utkarsh,

Ok, thanks for that information.   For my present case I can do some testing to determine which is which, but that limits how general purpose I can make a PF with multiple inputs.    There is not always a reasonable test which is known ahead of time.

Dennis,

That's indeed a problem, currently the order of inputs for the Programmable Filter is cryptic and inconsistent. I am going to see what I can do to fix this. It's a major annoyance.

All,

I?m a little uncertain about Programmable Filters with multiple inputs.   I had been assuming that if I had 2 inputs, then inputs[0] is the input that?s higher up in the Pipeline Browser, and inputs[1] is the lower input in the Pipeline Browser, but that does not always seem to be the case.     Is there some way to invoke the PF in such a way that I can know which input will be which?

Thanks

Sorry. I missed the version you were using. The location of that option moved to where I described in ParaView 4.2.

In ParaView 4.1, that option is in a separate "View Settings" dialog box. To get that dialog box, click the button on the left of the thin toolbar directly above the plot view. In the navigation panel on the right, click Left Axis -> Layout and then select "Specify axis range explicitly"

There is no automatic way to do it, but if you scroll down to the bottom of the Properties panel, you will see a checkbox marked "Left Axis Use Custom Range".


Thanks Ken. I do not see the checkbox. I am using the PV4.1.0 linux binary files downloaded from the paraview web site. Would this be a feature for the windows version?

Check that on and then enter the min/max values.

Is there an option so that animating plot over line will use the global max/min values instead of the localo max/min values for each time step?
animating contours uses the global max/min values and I would like to do this with plot over line.
Hope my question is clear.

Your config looks correct to me. I am assuming that you hit start on the
ParaView UI panel to actually let ParaView use that data?

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview 4.3.1 OSMesa build - QWidget::repaint:
 Recursive repaint detected
Message-ID: <CE2774317A7FEF42B4FAC0E0134EF92B010B417C@swmsmail4.swmed.org>

Hi,

After working through the information on the web I've built Paraview 4.3.1 with OSMesa support, osmesa 10.5.4 with llvmpipe, and libGlu 9.0.0. MPI is OpenMPI 1.8.3 and everything is compiled using the Intel 2015 compiler suite.

A Paraview build using MPI and standard OpenGL is working nicely on our GPU compute nodes with NVIDIA Tesla cards. However, if I start the OSMesa pvserver (for our non-GPU nodes) and connect from the client I immediately receive an error:

QWidget::repaint: Recursive repaint detected

The client will exit. The server doesn't exit, but is unresponsive to further connection attempts.

Has anyone else come across this issue with an OSMesa build? As above, the build using a physical NVIDIA card works great, with MPI working nicely etc.

Many Thanks,

All,

So I have taken a shot at this and have a few questions.

I have multiple blocks of quads and I need to find the nearest quad for every hex in the model (also multiple blocks).  The purpose of this is to assign the Normal to the nearest quad to each hex

My approach was:

1.       Create 2 inputs for the Programmable Filter

a.      1st is regular Exodus file

b.      2nd is regular file with Extract Surface/Generate Surface Normals/Cell Centers filters run ? this has no cells, only points at the quad centers that contain what I want, which is Normals to the quad (also contains points at the hex centers, which I will use later)

2.      In PF, I loop thru all quad blocks in the 2nd input and build 2 arrays.  First array has all the points in all the quad blocks in the 2nd input, and the second array has the corresponding normal associated with those points.

Now, I make a vtk.vtkKdTree and use BuildLocatorFromPoints(my pt array)
Now I loop over all hex in model, call FindClosestPoint using the point from the Cell Centers filter for the hex.  This returns an integer index and I assume Normals(index) is the normal associated with that quad

I do not get a sensible output.

My conclusion is that when I go thru this process, the index returned from FindClosestPoint is no longer synced to the original order of the points, which causes it to be a bad index into my Normals array.

It?s also extremely possible that there is some setup of kdTree that I need to do first that I am omitting.

So, is there a way to get kdTree to preserve the original order of the points, or is there another way to get an index back into my array of Normals, such that I can figure out which one is associated with the return from FindClosestPoint

I?m not sure this is clear enough to be interpreted by anyone, but here?s hoping.

Hi Dennis,

You might also be interested in the vtkCellCenters filter. As the name suggests, it
will generate the centers of the cells for you. If you are not in a big rush, I can build
you a small self contained sample in Python that demonstrates the filter and the
use of the point locator. I am a little busy at the moment, but I can post the sample
in a couple of days.

What about the following:

Generate two additional datasets, one containing (an approximate of) the center of the hex elements, the second the center of the quads. Then create a vtkKdTreePointLocator object based on the center points of the quad elements. Than loop over the centers of the hex elements and use one of the Find* methods to get the closest quad.

Sam,

Thanks for responding.  You have helped me several times in the past and I am always grateful for your insights.  In this case there is considerable refinement in the model, so only a very small portion of the hex elements are in immediate contact with quads.   Also you could think of places like the tread in the tire where there is no reinforcement whatsoever.

Another approach which I have considered is a wave propagation technique, where in the first wave every hex immediately adjacent to a quad gets direction cosines assigned (as you suggest).   Then you loop thru the remaining elements and assign cosines from any adjacent quad or hex that has cosines.   Eventually the direction cosines will propagate throughout the model.   A major complication is that wavefronts will collide and then you will have to choose which of several conflicting neighbor cosines to adopt.  Averaging is one approach but certain structures give adjoining cosines which are 180 degrees reversed, so averaging would give you an indeterminate direction.

I am toying now with some pseudo-variables, such as combinations of radius and lateral location, combined with zoning, to try to find a quantity that is unique for a local section of the geometry, to reduce the  search size for each hex element.

I am still hoping for a very clever scheme which someone may suggest before I proceed with these much more brute force methods.

Dennis



Sam Key Wrote:

Dennis,

Assuming for the moment that each quad 4-tuple is a finite element that contains one or more tire reinforcement items, and that each quad 4-tuple is "sandwiched" in between two hex 8-node finite elements, then the quad's 4-tuple is also a surface facet of two different 8-node hexahedrons. Both hexhedrons are the 'closest' hexhedrons to the quad. Given the usual organization of 'element blocks' in the Exodus-II datum structures, the two closest hexahedrons will be located on the surface of their respective element blocks.

Using material ID's which are also element block ID's, have the software generate surface side-sets for each of these two element blocks specified with these two material ID's. With luck, each member in the side-set will be specified as a 2-tuple, (Elem# in the block, Quad-Face# in the hexah)

With his info, you can confine your search to finding the side-set item that has a 4-tuple that matches your quad's 4-tuple. The search is reduced to a relatively small collection of hexahedral surface 4-tuple faces.

Hope this helps.

Subject: How to find the nearest quad element?

All,

I have an Exodus, multi-block model.  Most of the blocks are hex elements, and some are layers of quads (tires are composite structures).  I would like to establish local strains which are oriented in the direction of the nearest quad layer.  To do this I need to identify, for each hex in the model, which quad element in the model is closest to the hex.    Then I can extract directions from the quad element and rotate the strain tensor in the hex to these local coordinates.

My question is,  is there some clever and efficient way to quickly determine the nearest quad for each hex in the model.  Keep in mind that there are multiple blocks of quads, but if there is some way to address the quad blocks one at a time, I could make this work.

The brute force way is:
Loop over every hex in the model:
      Loop over every quad in the model:
             Calculate the distance between hex and quad
             Smallest distance wins!

That is a pretty brutally inefficient calc (several million hex elements) that I am trying to avoid ? any ideas about how best to approach this.   I?m hoping for some elegant way to use connectivity or something of that sort.

Thanks for looking

Dennis

Oddly, I was communicating with someone about a similar issue, but haven't
been able to get to the root cause. Do you have a debug build of ParaView?
Would it be possible to get a callstack to when than error message is
popped up?

Yes I do, and when I do this, I get a note from vrpn_server that
ParaView has connected, and when I hit stop, I get the note that the
connection was dropped. All what I would expect, except that ParaView
does not react to the input...

Utkarsh,

Thanks for the note. Glad to know that we might not be the only ones with the issue. I?m working on getting a debug build and callstack now. Just thought I?d post first in case anyone had any ideas.

Oddly, I was communicating with someone about a similar issue, but haven't been able to get to the root cause. Do you have a debug build of ParaView? Would it be possible to get a callstack to when than error message is popped up?

Hi,

After working through the information on the web I?ve built Paraview 4.3.1 with OSMesa support, osmesa 10.5.4 with llvmpipe, and libGlu 9.0.0. MPI is OpenMPI 1.8.3 and everything is compiled using the Intel 2015 compiler suite.

A Paraview build using MPI and standard OpenGL is working nicely on our GPU compute nodes with NVIDIA Tesla cards. However, if I start the OSMesa pvserver (for our non-GPU nodes) and connect from the client I immediately receive an error:

QWidget::repaint: Recursive repaint detected

The client will exit. The server doesn?t exit, but is unresponsive to further connection attempts.

Has anyone else come across this issue with an OSMesa build? As above, the build using a physical NVIDIA card works great, with MPI working nicely etc.

Many Thanks,

Hi

I am new to paraview and H5part file format. Can someone please guide me towards a link or tutorial that guides step by step for visualizing h5part files ? I have tried searching on google or opening the H5part files by myself but couldnt get anywhere.

Amit,

There's a "H5PartReader" plugin that you can load using the "Tools | Manage
Plugins" dialog. Once the plugin has been loaded, you can open *.h5part
files using the H5Part reader using the File | Open  dialog.

Selection extraction isn't supported yet (well not gracefully anyways)
through the Python API. However, you can use the following for similar
effect:

OpenDataFIle(...)
ExtractSurface()
GenerateIds()

threshold1 = Threshold()
threshold1.Scalars = ['CELLS', 'Ids']
threshold1.ThresholdRange = [4.5, 5.5] # to extract cell with Id 5.

Dear Cory. Thanks for the tip. I've tried, but there seems to be a problem,
as after trying what you suggested, the grid does not show the texture
correctly... it looks like a solid, black, color. Meshlab has no such
problems... still trying to figure this out.

Thanks again.

My best, Mart?n

Martin,

Is it possible to share a sample file and texture? That would be a great
help in figuring out what might be going wrong.

Thanks,

Hi,

Built a debug version. On the client side I now noticed the following warning on the console after I acknowledge the error dialog:

Only 3 or 4 component images are handled.

The pvserver stack trace is below. I guess this is something to do with the OSMesa config?

Utkarsh,

Thanks for the note. Glad to know that we might not be the only ones with the issue. I?m working on getting a debug build and callstack now. Just thought I?d post first in case anyone had any ideas.

Oddly, I was communicating with someone about a similar issue, but haven't been able to get to the root cause. Do you have a debug build of ParaView? Would it be possible to get a callstack to when than error message is popped up?

Hi,

After working through the information on the web I?ve built Paraview 4.3.1 with OSMesa support, osmesa 10.5.4 with llvmpipe, and libGlu 9.0.0. MPI is OpenMPI 1.8.3 and everything is compiled using the Intel 2015 compiler suite.

A Paraview build using MPI and standard OpenGL is working nicely on our GPU compute nodes with NVIDIA Tesla cards. However, if I start the OSMesa pvserver (for our non-GPU nodes) and connect from the client I immediately receive an error:

QWidget::repaint: Recursive repaint detected

The client will exit. The server doesn?t exit, but is unresponsive to further connection attempts.

Has anyone else come across this issue with an OSMesa build? As above, the build using a physical NVIDIA card works great, with MPI working nicely etc.

Many Thanks,

Mind attaching the CMakeCache.txt from the server build? BTW, this is
totally different error than what we started with. The original issue was
that the client was complaining about recursive paint. Seems to me the
pvserver build is a little messed up right now.

Hi


I am trying to run paraview scripts from the command line without using the
specific pvpython from paraview (this one works).


This is my setup:


    Mac OS X 10.10.5

    Paraview 4.3.1

    Python 2.7.10 :: Anaconda 2.3.0 (x86_64)


I have tried several solutions that are supposed to work (but don't, at
 least for me) and ended up with the two env variable definitions in my
.bash_profile


    export
PYTHONPATH="/Applications/paraview.app/Contents/Libraries:/Applications/paraview.app/Contents/Python/paraview:/Applications/paraview.app/Contents/Python/vtk:/Applications/paraview.app/Contents/Python/paraview"


    export
LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/Applications/paraview.app/Contents/Libraries:/Applications/paraview.app/Contents/Python/paraview:/Applications/paraview.app/Contents/Python/vtk:/Applications/paraview.app/Contents/Python/paraview"


I have only 3 python installations in my system: anaconda, system python
and pvpython from paraview. All installed in default directories.


>From the python shell console is I run:


    import os

    os.environ


I do see the two variables `PYTHONPATH` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.


Honestly I have no idea of what else to try. This seems to be a common
issue given the number of people that ask the same question. It also seems
not to be limited to paraview. Thanks

Ruggiero

Thank you!
I know the paraview have the D3 filter , If I don't use the D3 filter , Does the paraview use the Icet to sort last ? I find that all nodes need to know  all the datas . In this situation , if sort-last, I think that every node  don't need all the datas , why should this?

ParaView uses IceT and does sort last compositing. ParaView gives IceT color and depth buffers from each node, IceT quickly gives us a depth composited image.


There are exceptions, but in general we do not do anything special with regards to load balancing. Rather, we read in the data in parallel and keep whatever partitioning scheme the simulation code that produced it wrote it in.

        Hello everyone . Recently, I do some research about parallel rendering . I want to know how paraview do the parallel rendering . Does it use sort last or sort first ,or both .
        I know it use IceT at last . If Icet is a sort last libaray , it should transfer the final pixel to the corresponding node , where  it do this . Or it is a sort first , so every node has all the datas ,and just render the datas corresponding to the screen .
        Also ,i want to know if paraview achieve the loading balance ,and how does this?
        who can tell me these ,thank you very much!

Look at the paths in the output of:

    >>> import sys
    >>> sys.path

from pvpython. You may be missing some paths (there are 4 or 5 IIRC, but
the paraview.app packaging may reduce that).

OS X uses 'DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH', not 'LD_LIBRARY_PATH'. You should only
need to use the '/Applications/paraview.app/Contents/Libraries'[1] path
for this.

All,

I thought an example of my ?not sensible? output would make this clearer, see the picture below.
All of the highlighted hex elements are at the edge of the piece and the lower edge of the piece is covered in membrane elements (quads).   So, each of the highlighted hex elements actually shares 4 nodes with a quad.   Therefore, the closest quad to each of those hex elements should be the attached quad, and each of the highlighted hexes should get a different index returned from FindClosestPoint.
I have displayed the actual index returned from FindClosestPoint on each hex.    So there are 5 hexes that FindClosestPoint thinks quad18 is the closest quad, similarly 5 hexes for quad19, 5 hexes for quad20.

I expect that each of the highlighted hexes should get a different index returned from FindClosestPoint and that index should correspond to the individual membrane that each hex shares 4 nodes with.

I still am not sure that this will make sense, but any ideas why this is not behaving as I expected?

Thanks for any help

Dennis

Subject: RE: [EXT] Re: [Paraview] How to find the nearest quad element?

All,

So I have taken a shot at this and have a few questions.

I have multiple blocks of quads and I need to find the nearest quad for every hex in the model (also multiple blocks).  The purpose of this is to assign the Normal to the nearest quad to each hex

My approach was:

1.       Create 2 inputs for the Programmable Filter

a.      1st is regular Exodus file

b.      2nd is regular file with Extract Surface/Generate Surface Normals/Cell Centers filters run ? this has no cells, only points at the quad centers that contain what I want, which is Normals to the quad (also contains points at the hex centers, which I will use later)

2.      In PF, I loop thru all quad blocks in the 2nd input and build 2 arrays.  First array has all the points in all the quad blocks in the 2nd input, and the second array has the corresponding normal associated with those points.

Now, I make a vtk.vtkKdTree and use BuildLocatorFromPoints(my pt array)
Now I loop over all hex in model, call FindClosestPoint using the point from the Cell Centers filter for the hex.  This returns an integer index and I assume Normals(index) is the normal associated with that quad

I do not get a sensible output.

My conclusion is that when I go thru this process, the index returned from FindClosestPoint is no longer synced to the original order of the points, which causes it to be a bad index into my Normals array.

It?s also extremely possible that there is some setup of kdTree that I need to do first that I am omitting.

So, is there a way to get kdTree to preserve the original order of the points, or is there another way to get an index back into my array of Normals, such that I can figure out which one is associated with the return from FindClosestPoint

I?m not sure this is clear enough to be interpreted by anyone, but here?s hoping.

Hi Dennis,

You might also be interested in the vtkCellCenters filter. As the name suggests, it
will generate the centers of the cells for you. If you are not in a big rush, I can build
you a small self contained sample in Python that demonstrates the filter and the
use of the point locator. I am a little busy at the moment, but I can post the sample
in a couple of days.

What about the following:

Generate two additional datasets, one containing (an approximate of) the center of the hex elements, the second the center of the quads. Then create a vtkKdTreePointLocator object based on the center points of the quad elements. Than loop over the centers of the hex elements and use one of the Find* methods to get the closest quad.

Sam,

Thanks for responding.  You have helped me several times in the past and I am always grateful for your insights.  In this case there is considerable refinement in the model, so only a very small portion of the hex elements are in immediate contact with quads.   Also you could think of places like the tread in the tire where there is no reinforcement whatsoever.

Another approach which I have considered is a wave propagation technique, where in the first wave every hex immediately adjacent to a quad gets direction cosines assigned (as you suggest).   Then you loop thru the remaining elements and assign cosines from any adjacent quad or hex that has cosines.   Eventually the direction cosines will propagate throughout the model.   A major complication is that wavefronts will collide and then you will have to choose which of several conflicting neighbor cosines to adopt.  Averaging is one approach but certain structures give adjoining cosines which are 180 degrees reversed, so averaging would give you an indeterminate direction.

I am toying now with some pseudo-variables, such as combinations of radius and lateral location, combined with zoning, to try to find a quantity that is unique for a local section of the geometry, to reduce the  search size for each hex element.

I am still hoping for a very clever scheme which someone may suggest before I proceed with these much more brute force methods.

Sam Key Wrote:

Dennis,

Assuming for the moment that each quad 4-tuple is a finite element that contains one or more tire reinforcement items, and that each quad 4-tuple is "sandwiched" in between two hex 8-node finite elements, then the quad's 4-tuple is also a surface facet of two different 8-node hexahedrons. Both hexhedrons are the 'closest' hexhedrons to the quad. Given the usual organization of 'element blocks' in the Exodus-II datum structures, the two closest hexahedrons will be located on the surface of their respective element blocks.

Using material ID's which are also element block ID's, have the software generate surface side-sets for each of these two element blocks specified with these two material ID's. With luck, each member in the side-set will be specified as a 2-tuple, (Elem# in the block, Quad-Face# in the hexah)

With his info, you can confine your search to finding the side-set item that has a 4-tuple that matches your quad's 4-tuple. The search is reduced to a relatively small collection of hexahedral surface 4-tuple faces.

Hope this helps.

Subject: How to find the nearest quad element?

All,

I have an Exodus, multi-block model.  Most of the blocks are hex elements, and some are layers of quads (tires are composite structures).  I would like to establish local strains which are oriented in the direction of the nearest quad layer.  To do this I need to identify, for each hex in the model, which quad element in the model is closest to the hex.    Then I can extract directions from the quad element and rotate the strain tensor in the hex to these local coordinates.

My question is,  is there some clever and efficient way to quickly determine the nearest quad for each hex in the model.  Keep in mind that there are multiple blocks of quads, but if there is some way to address the quad blocks one at a time, I could make this work.

The brute force way is:
Loop over every hex in the model:
      Loop over every quad in the model:
             Calculate the distance between hex and quad
             Smallest distance wins!

That is a pretty brutally inefficient calc (several million hex elements) that I am trying to avoid ? any ideas about how best to approach this.   I?m hoping for some elegant way to use connectivity or something of that sort.

Thanks for looking

Dennis

Hi Dennis,

Sorry for not coming back with an example yet. I had a few other things
that keep
me really busy. I don't have a solution yet, but I was wondering if you
visualized
the center point locations you believe are used as a basis for the cell
locator.
I typically do this by creating a vertex (point cell) for every point that
I am interested
in. In this way you can plot the point, the hex and the quad and continue
debugging
from there.

Marco,

Hey, we are all busy, I understand that ? and I don?t mind doing the work myself but I?m not having success here.

I have looked at the vertex from the Cell Centers filter and they looked okay to me.  I am just now editing my script so that each hex will get the GlobalElementID of the quad that GetClosestPoint thinks is closest, so I can dig a little deeper.

Would it be useful for me to attach my script so that any obvious mistakes can be detected?

Hi Dennis,

Sorry for not coming back with an example yet. I had a few other things that keep
me really busy. I don't have a solution yet, but I was wondering if you visualized
the center point locations you believe are used as a basis for the cell locator.
I typically do this by creating a vertex (point cell) for every point that I am interested
in. In this way you can plot the point, the hex and the quad and continue debugging
from there.

All,

I thought an example of my ?not sensible? output would make this clearer, see the picture below.
All of the highlighted hex elements are at the edge of the piece and the lower edge of the piece is covered in membrane elements (quads).   So, each of the highlighted hex elements actually shares 4 nodes with a quad.   Therefore, the closest quad to each of those hex elements should be the attached quad, and each of the highlighted hexes should get a different index returned from FindClosestPoint.
I have displayed the actual index returned from FindClosestPoint on each hex.    So there are 5 hexes that FindClosestPoint thinks quad18 is the closest quad, similarly 5 hexes for quad19, 5 hexes for quad20.

I expect that each of the highlighted hexes should get a different index returned from FindClosestPoint and that index should correspond to the individual membrane that each hex shares 4 nodes with.

I still am not sure that this will make sense, but any ideas why this is not behaving as I expected?

Thanks for any help

Subject: RE: [EXT] Re: [Paraview] How to find the nearest quad element?

All,

So I have taken a shot at this and have a few questions.

I have multiple blocks of quads and I need to find the nearest quad for every hex in the model (also multiple blocks).  The purpose of this is to assign the Normal to the nearest quad to each hex

My approach was:

1.       Create 2 inputs for the Programmable Filter

a.      1st is regular Exodus file

b.      2nd is regular file with Extract Surface/Generate Surface Normals/Cell Centers filters run ? this has no cells, only points at the quad centers that contain what I want, which is Normals to the quad (also contains points at the hex centers, which I will use later)

2.      In PF, I loop thru all quad blocks in the 2nd input and build 2 arrays.  First array has all the points in all the quad blocks in the 2nd input, and the second array has the corresponding normal associated with those points.

Now, I make a vtk.vtkKdTree and use BuildLocatorFromPoints(my pt array)
Now I loop over all hex in model, call FindClosestPoint using the point from the Cell Centers filter for the hex.  This returns an integer index and I assume Normals(index) is the normal associated with that quad

I do not get a sensible output.

My conclusion is that when I go thru this process, the index returned from FindClosestPoint is no longer synced to the original order of the points, which causes it to be a bad index into my Normals array.

It?s also extremely possible that there is some setup of kdTree that I need to do first that I am omitting.

So, is there a way to get kdTree to preserve the original order of the points, or is there another way to get an index back into my array of Normals, such that I can figure out which one is associated with the return from FindClosestPoint

I?m not sure this is clear enough to be interpreted by anyone, but here?s hoping.

Hi Dennis,

You might also be interested in the vtkCellCenters filter. As the name suggests, it
will generate the centers of the cells for you. If you are not in a big rush, I can build
you a small self contained sample in Python that demonstrates the filter and the
use of the point locator. I am a little busy at the moment, but I can post the sample
in a couple of days.

Subject: [EXT] Re: [Paraview] How to find the nearest quad element?

What about the following:

Generate two additional datasets, one containing (an approximate of) the center of the hex elements, the second the center of the quads. Then create a vtkKdTreePointLocator object based on the center points of the quad elements. Than loop over the centers of the hex elements and use one of the Find* methods to get the closest quad.

Sam,

Thanks for responding.  You have helped me several times in the past and I am always grateful for your insights.  In this case there is considerable refinement in the model, so only a very small portion of the hex elements are in immediate contact with quads.   Also you could think of places like the tread in the tire where there is no reinforcement whatsoever.

Another approach which I have considered is a wave propagation technique, where in the first wave every hex immediately adjacent to a quad gets direction cosines assigned (as you suggest).   Then you loop thru the remaining elements and assign cosines from any adjacent quad or hex that has cosines.   Eventually the direction cosines will propagate throughout the model.   A major complication is that wavefronts will collide and then you will have to choose which of several conflicting neighbor cosines to adopt.  Averaging is one approach but certain structures give adjoining cosines which are 180 degrees reversed, so averaging would give you an indeterminate direction.

I am toying now with some pseudo-variables, such as combinations of radius and lateral location, combined with zoning, to try to find a quantity that is unique for a local section of the geometry, to reduce the  search size for each hex element.

I am still hoping for a very clever scheme which someone may suggest before I proceed with these much more brute force methods.

Dennis,

Assuming for the moment that each quad 4-tuple is a finite element that contains one or more tire reinforcement items, and that each quad 4-tuple is "sandwiched" in between two hex 8-node finite elements, then the quad's 4-tuple is also a surface facet of two different 8-node hexahedrons. Both hexhedrons are the 'closest' hexhedrons to the quad. Given the usual organization of 'element blocks' in the Exodus-II datum structures, the two closest hexahedrons will be located on the surface of their respective element blocks.

Using material ID's which are also element block ID's, have the software generate surface side-sets for each of these two element blocks specified with these two material ID's. With luck, each member in the side-set will be specified as a 2-tuple, (Elem# in the block, Quad-Face# in the hexah)

With his info, you can confine your search to finding the side-set item that has a 4-tuple that matches your quad's 4-tuple. The search is reduced to a relatively small collection of hexahedral surface 4-tuple faces.

Hope this helps.

Subject: How to find the nearest quad element?

All,

I have an Exodus, multi-block model.  Most of the blocks are hex elements, and some are layers of quads (tires are composite structures).  I would like to establish local strains which are oriented in the direction of the nearest quad layer.  To do this I need to identify, for each hex in the model, which quad element in the model is closest to the hex.    Then I can extract directions from the quad element and rotate the strain tensor in the hex to these local coordinates.

My question is,  is there some clever and efficient way to quickly determine the nearest quad for each hex in the model.  Keep in mind that there are multiple blocks of quads, but if there is some way to address the quad blocks one at a time, I could make this work.

The brute force way is:
Loop over every hex in the model:
      Loop over every quad in the model:
             Calculate the distance between hex and quad
             Smallest distance wins!

That is a pretty brutally inefficient calc (several million hex elements) that I am trying to avoid ? any ideas about how best to approach this.   I?m hoping for some elegant way to use connectivity or something of that sort.

Thanks for looking

Dennis

ParaView always uses iceT to sort last.

Sort last means nodes don't really care at all what the others have. Each
just renders whatever they have locally, communicate the color and depth
buffer, and let a depth buffer decide who's color wins at each pixel.

D3 is orthogonal. If you apply it, than a number of other parallel filters
work better than they otherwise would. It makes the results are nice and
contiguous on each node which generally means less communication is needed
between the nodes.

Hi Richard,

If you don't mind, let's keep the discussion on the list so that others may
benefit from the discussion.

Outputting a vtkTable is the right thing to do. What I suspect is happening
with the first error message is that if you execute a programmable source
with the output set to one type of data set (e.g., vtkPolyData), there is a
bug that doesn't let you switch to a different type of output. As a
workaround, you can create a new Programmable Source, copy and paste your
code from the original Programmable Source into the new one, and set the
output type to vtkTableData *before* you click Apply.

To view line plots of your data, you'll need to create a Line Chart View by
splitting the 3D Render View. To do this, look for the icon on the top
right of the 3D Render View that has two vertically-oriented rectangles
side by side (tool tip "Split Horizontal"). In the list of views that comes
up, click on "Line Chart View". If your line plots are not visible right
away, you will need to make them visible by clicking on the eye icon next
to the Programmable Source. Voila, you should have a line plot.

Hope that helps,
Cory

For sure it is useful to attach the script if this is not too problematic

Hey, we are all busy, I understand that ? and I don?t mind doing the work myself but I?m not having success here.

I have looked at the vertex from the Cell Centers filter and they looked okay to me.  I am just now editing my script so that each hex will get the GlobalElementID of the quad that GetClosestPoint thinks is closest, so I can dig a little deeper.

Would it be useful for me to attach my script so that any obvious mistakes can be detected?

Hi Dennis,

Sorry for not coming back with an example yet. I had a few other things that keep
me really busy. I don't have a solution yet, but I was wondering if you visualized
the center point locations you believe are used as a basis for the cell locator.
I typically do this by creating a vertex (point cell) for every point that I am interested
in. In this way you can plot the point, the hex and the quad and continue debugging
from there.

All,

I thought an example of my ?not sensible? output would make this clearer, see the picture below.
All of the highlighted hex elements are at the edge of the piece and the lower edge of the piece is covered in membrane elements (quads).   So, each of the highlighted hex elements actually shares 4 nodes with a quad.   Therefore, the closest quad to each of those hex elements should be the attached quad, and each of the highlighted hexes should get a different index returned from FindClosestPoint.
I have displayed the actual index returned from FindClosestPoint on each hex.    So there are 5 hexes that FindClosestPoint thinks quad18 is the closest quad, similarly 5 hexes for quad19, 5 hexes for quad20.

I expect that each of the highlighted hexes should get a different index returned from FindClosestPoint and that index should correspond to the individual membrane that each hex shares 4 nodes with.

I still am not sure that this will make sense, but any ideas why this is not behaving as I expected?

Thanks for any help

Subject: RE: [EXT] Re: [Paraview] How to find the nearest quad element?

All,

So I have taken a shot at this and have a few questions.

I have multiple blocks of quads and I need to find the nearest quad for every hex in the model (also multiple blocks).  The purpose of this is to assign the Normal to the nearest quad to each hex

My approach was:

1.       Create 2 inputs for the Programmable Filter

a.      1st is regular Exodus file

b.      2nd is regular file with Extract Surface/Generate Surface Normals/Cell Centers filters run ? this has no cells, only points at the quad centers that contain what I want, which is Normals to the quad (also contains points at the hex centers, which I will use later)

2.      In PF, I loop thru all quad blocks in the 2nd input and build 2 arrays.  First array has all the points in all the quad blocks in the 2nd input, and the second array has the corresponding normal associated with those points.

Now, I make a vtk.vtkKdTree and use BuildLocatorFromPoints(my pt array)
Now I loop over all hex in model, call FindClosestPoint using the point from the Cell Centers filter for the hex.  This returns an integer index and I assume Normals(index) is the normal associated with that quad

I do not get a sensible output.

My conclusion is that when I go thru this process, the index returned from FindClosestPoint is no longer synced to the original order of the points, which causes it to be a bad index into my Normals array.

It?s also extremely possible that there is some setup of kdTree that I need to do first that I am omitting.

So, is there a way to get kdTree to preserve the original order of the points, or is there another way to get an index back into my array of Normals, such that I can figure out which one is associated with the return from FindClosestPoint

I?m not sure this is clear enough to be interpreted by anyone, but here?s hoping.

Hi Dennis,

You might also be interested in the vtkCellCenters filter. As the name suggests, it
will generate the centers of the cells for you. If you are not in a big rush, I can build
you a small self contained sample in Python that demonstrates the filter and the
use of the point locator. I am a little busy at the moment, but I can post the sample
in a couple of days.

What about the following:

Generate two additional datasets, one containing (an approximate of) the center of the hex elements, the second the center of the quads. Then create a vtkKdTreePointLocator object based on the center points of the quad elements. Than loop over the centers of the hex elements and use one of the Find* methods to get the closest quad.

Sam,

Thanks for responding.  You have helped me several times in the past and I am always grateful for your insights.  In this case there is considerable refinement in the model, so only a very small portion of the hex elements are in immediate contact with quads.   Also you could think of places like the tread in the tire where there is no reinforcement whatsoever.

Another approach which I have considered is a wave propagation technique, where in the first wave every hex immediately adjacent to a quad gets direction cosines assigned (as you suggest).   Then you loop thru the remaining elements and assign cosines from any adjacent quad or hex that has cosines.   Eventually the direction cosines will propagate throughout the model.   A major complication is that wavefronts will collide and then you will have to choose which of several conflicting neighbor cosines to adopt.  Averaging is one approach but certain structures give adjoining cosines which are 180 degrees reversed, so averaging would give you an indeterminate direction.

I am toying now with some pseudo-variables, such as combinations of radius and lateral location, combined with zoning, to try to find a quantity that is unique for a local section of the geometry, to reduce the  search size for each hex element.

I am still hoping for a very clever scheme which someone may suggest before I proceed with these much more brute force methods.

Dennis,

Assuming for the moment that each quad 4-tuple is a finite element that contains one or more tire reinforcement items, and that each quad 4-tuple is "sandwiched" in between two hex 8-node finite elements, then the quad's 4-tuple is also a surface facet of two different 8-node hexahedrons. Both hexhedrons are the 'closest' hexhedrons to the quad. Given the usual organization of 'element blocks' in the Exodus-II datum structures, the two closest hexahedrons will be located on the surface of their respective element blocks.

Using material ID's which are also element block ID's, have the software generate surface side-sets for each of these two element blocks specified with these two material ID's. With luck, each member in the side-set will be specified as a 2-tuple, (Elem# in the block, Quad-Face# in the hexah)

With his info, you can confine your search to finding the side-set item that has a 4-tuple that matches your quad's 4-tuple. The search is reduced to a relatively small collection of hexahedral surface 4-tuple faces.

Hope this helps.

Subject: How to find the nearest quad element?

All,

I have an Exodus, multi-block model.  Most of the blocks are hex elements, and some are layers of quads (tires are composite structures).  I would like to establish local strains which are oriented in the direction of the nearest quad layer.  To do this I need to identify, for each hex in the model, which quad element in the model is closest to the hex.    Then I can extract directions from the quad element and rotate the strain tensor in the hex to these local coordinates.

My question is,  is there some clever and efficient way to quickly determine the nearest quad for each hex in the model.  Keep in mind that there are multiple blocks of quads, but if there is some way to address the quad blocks one at a time, I could make this work.

The brute force way is:
Loop over every hex in the model:
      Loop over every quad in the model:
             Calculate the distance between hex and quad
             Smallest distance wins!

That is a pretty brutally inefficient calc (several million hex elements) that I am trying to avoid ? any ideas about how best to approach this.   I?m hoping for some elegant way to use connectivity or something of that sort.

Thanks for looking

Dennis

Have sent the CMakeCache.txt off list as it?s a couple hundred KB.

I still get the recursive paint error on the client ? it immediately precedes the warning about the 3/4 component images from the client, and the crash on the server. In the non-debug server I don?t get a segfault ? but it becomes completely unresponsive to further connection attempts.

The recursive paint error is server dependent. If I use the client to connect to a standard binary, or a self-built OpenGL pvserver then no issues. Only get the recursive paint issue when I try to connect to the self-built OSMesa pvserver.

Thanks again,

DT

Mind attaching the CMakeCache.txt from the server build? BTW, this is totally different error than what we started with. The original issue was that the client was complaining about recursive paint. Seems to me the pvserver build is a little messed up right now.

Utkarsh,

Thanks for the note. Glad to know that we might not be the only ones with the issue. I?m working on getting a debug build and callstack now. Just thought I?d post first in case anyone had any ideas.

Oddly, I was communicating with someone about a similar issue, but haven't been able to get to the root cause. Do you have a debug build of ParaView? Would it be possible to get a callstack to when than error message is popped up?

Hi,

After working through the information on the web I?ve built Paraview 4.3.1 with OSMesa support, osmesa 10.5.4 with llvmpipe, and libGlu 9.0.0. MPI is OpenMPI 1.8.3 and everything is compiled using the Intel 2015 compiler suite.

A Paraview build using MPI and standard OpenGL is working nicely on our GPU compute nodes with NVIDIA Tesla cards. However, if I start the OSMesa pvserver (for our non-GPU nodes) and connect from the client I immediately receive an error:

QWidget::repaint: Recursive repaint detected

The client will exit. The server doesn?t exit, but is unresponsive to further connection attempts.

Has anyone else come across this issue with an OSMesa build? As above, the build using a physical NVIDIA card works great, with MPI working nicely etc.

Many Thanks,

I have a feeling something's wrong with the OSMesa build. Try running
pvpython/pvbatch on that build. Are you able to render/save images from the
Python clients?

Hi Utkarsh,

I built Catalyst 4.4-RC2, pulled the examples, and compiled CxxMappedDataArrayExample.
When running it, I get this:

./CxxMappedDataArrayExample SampleScripts/feslicescript.py
Error: Cannot import vtkPVServerManagerDefaultPython
Error: Cannot import vtkPVAnimationPython

Thanks,

Matthieu

Hi Utkarsh,

Thanks a lot, I'll give it a try.

Matthieu,

There indeed seems to be some issue with 4.3 editions. Since the code worked as expected with the latest ParaView 4.4-RC2, here's what I did:

1. Created a pull request to update the CatalystExamples code to build with 4.4-RC2 here (https://github.com/Kitware/ParaViewCatalystExampleCode/pull/5). Once Andy gets a chance to review these, they will get merged in.
2. I've uploaded Catalyst editions for 4.4-RC2 to http://www.paraview.org/download/. I'd suggest using the 4.4-RC2 editions along with the build fixes in the above pull request.

Note not all examples will build with the Editions (since the Editions don't have all the code from ParaView). I verified however that the CxxMappedDataArrayExample builds and runs with the Rendering-Python edition that you had selected earlier.

Matthieu,

Those messages are pretty much warnings. The Catalyst editions don't
have all ParaView modules and hence the Python script prompts about
missing modules. The code should still be executing properly.

Utkarsh,

Thanks ? your hunch was correct. Went back through building llvm, osmesa, libGlu and now have a working setup. Not sure where I went wrong, but it?s all good now.

I have a feeling something's wrong with the OSMesa build. Try running pvpython/pvbatch on that build. Are you able to render/save images from the Python clients?

Have sent the CMakeCache.txt off list as it?s a couple hundred KB.

I still get the recursive paint error on the client ? it immediately precedes the warning about the 3/4 component images from the client, and the crash on the server. In the non-debug server I don?t get a segfault ? but it becomes completely unresponsive to further connection attempts.

The recursive paint error is server dependent. If I use the client to connect to a standard binary, or a self-built OpenGL pvserver then no issues. Only get the recursive paint issue when I try to connect to the self-built OSMesa pvserver.

Thanks again,

DT

Mind attaching the CMakeCache.txt from the server build? BTW, this is totally different error than what we started with. The original issue was that the client was complaining about recursive paint. Seems to me the pvserver build is a little messed up right now.

Built a debug version. On the client side I now noticed the following warning on the console after I acknowledge the error dialog:

The pvserver stack trace is below. I guess this is something to do with the OSMesa config?

Utkarsh,

Thanks for the note. Glad to know that we might not be the only ones with the issue. I?m working on getting a debug build and callstack now. Just thought I?d post first in case anyone had any ideas.

Oddly, I was communicating with someone about a similar issue, but haven't been able to get to the root cause. Do you have a debug build of ParaView? Would it be possible to get a callstack to when than error message is popped up?

Hi,

After working through the information on the web I?ve built Paraview 4.3.1 with OSMesa support, osmesa 10.5.4 with llvmpipe, and libGlu 9.0.0. MPI is OpenMPI 1.8.3 and everything is compiled using the Intel 2015 compiler suite.

A Paraview build using MPI and standard OpenGL is working nicely on our GPU compute nodes with NVIDIA Tesla cards. However, if I start the OSMesa pvserver (for our non-GPU nodes) and connect from the client I immediately receive an error:

QWidget::repaint: Recursive repaint detected

The client will exit. The server doesn?t exit, but is unresponsive to further connection attempts.

Has anyone else come across this issue with an OSMesa build? As above, the build using a physical NVIDIA card works great, with MPI working nicely etc.

Many Thanks,

If you have built ParaView and let the build download the external data (the default options), then the files can be accessed from ExternalData in the build directory.

Thanks Ken!

Since some of my LANs and clusters can't see the outside world, I always manually pull the build files.  Thus, ExternalData is not in my build directory.

Is there a manual way to do the pull?

Message-ID: <20150909210024.GA6250@biohpcws064.biohpc.swmed.edu>

Hi,

We have been experimenting with using Paraview to display very volumes from very
large TIFF stacks generated by whole-brain microscopy equipment. The test stack
has dimensions of 5,368x10,695x150. Stack is assembled in ImageJ from individual
TIFFs, exported as a RAW and loaded into paraview. Saved as a .vti for
convenience. Can view slices fine in standalone paraview client on a 256GB machine.

When we attempt volume rendering on this data across multiple nodes with MPI
nothing appears in the client. Surface view works as expected. On switching to
volume rendering the client's display will show nothing. There are no messages
from the client or servers - no output.

This is happening when running pvserver across GPU nodes with NVIDIA Tesla
cards, or using CPU only with OSMESA. pvserver memory usage is well below what
we have on the nodes - no memory warnings/errors.

Data is about 17GB, 8 billion cells. If we downsize to ~4GB or ~9GB then we can
get working volume rendering. The 17GB never works regardless of scaling
nodes/mpi processes. The 4/9GB will work on 1 or 2 nodes.

Am confused by the lack of rendering, as we don't have memory issues, or an
other messages at all. Am wondering if there are any inherent limitation, or I'm
missing something stupid.

Thanks,

Dave Trudgian

I have nothing to add, other than volume rendering 8 billion cells would be amazing.  ParaView should grumble, but maybe you are running out of memory?  Try using the View/ Memory Inspector for the datasets below that actually do work?  Then, do the same for your big one?

    renderView1.CameraFocalPoint = [5, 5, 0.0]
    renderView1.CameraViewUp = [0.0, 1.0, 0.0]
    scale = (heigth) / 2.0
    renderView1.CameraParallelScale = scale

    Render()
    SaveScreenshot("/Users/ruggiero/dev/test.png", magnification=1)

The problem is that the `ViewSize` seems to be ignored and I keep having
images of fixed size 1707 ? 855. The height 855 seems to be a kind of
limit; the only way to get what I want is to limit the `ViewSize` to
855x855.

I have checked [this][2] question and [this][3] question, but with no
success.

Any idea? I am not very confident in the settings for the camera. Could
this be the issue?

Subject: [Paraview] Time Steps - possible bug?
Message-ID: <CAKrZ8ydEOOPFgB9Q731Up2JfaSMdabVetHAtoqM_YJqai9pixw@mail.gmail.com>

Hey

I am working with time steps (100s of VTU files) and I run programmable
sources along them. Everything was fine till some hours ago, where my code
stopped working and my old (working code) also ... So I cut it down to a
very simple thing, that still does not work - here my steps:

Open ParaView
Open 100 VTU* files
Apply
Sources -> Programmable Source -> Choose vtkTable as Output Data Set Type
Script:
t = inputs[0].GetInformation().Get(vtk.vtkDataObject.DATA_TIME_STEP())

print t


which returns (in the output window):

Traceback (most recent call last):

  File "<string>", line 19, in <module>

  File "<string>", line 2, in RequestData

IndexError: list index out of range


Which worked really fine before. So what am I missing here?


Thanks

Richard

Programmable Sources have no input. What you probably wish to use is a Programmable Filter

I will upload the tar balls for the data. Do you want me to upload for RC2
or just wait for 4.4?

This is pretty awesome. I am assuming that this has something to do with
things not fitting on the GPU memory or exceeding some texture memory
limitation. Can you provide some more details?

* Which version of ParaView are you using?
* It sounds like you have multiple GPUs and multiple nodes. What is the
setup? Are you running in parallel with MPI?
* If you are running parallel with MPI and you have multiple GPUs per node,
did you setup the DISPLAYs to leverage the GPUs?

Best,

Dave,

This is pretty awesome stuff. Berk already asked some relevant questions.
My thought is that if its a texture memory limitation, then scaling should
have helped. How many nodes did you try when using full size dataset?

Sure - thanks for your help.

This is with Paraview 4.3.1

Have tried in two ways, both are using MPI (OpenMPI/1.8.3 on an InfiniBand FDR
network):

Setup 1) Paraview 4.3.1 pvserver is running with MPI across multiple cluster
nodes, each with a Tesla K20 GPU. Only up to 4 nodes total, each one has a
single Tesla K20. Have used various numbers of MPI tasks. The machines are 16
physical cores, with hyper-threading on for 32 logical cores. 256GB RAM and the
Tesla K20 has 5GB.

... when this didn't work we did suspect out of GPU memory. Since we have a
limited number of GPU nodes then decided to try the CPU approach...

Setup 2) Paraview 4.3.1 rebuilt with OSMESA support, to run pvserver on a larger
number of cluster nodes without any GPUs. These are 16 or 24 core machines with
128/256/384GB RAM. Tried various numbers of nodes (up to 16) and
MPI tasks per node, allowing for OSMESA threading per the docs/graphs on the
Paraview wiki page.

Watching the pvserver processes when running across 16 nodes I wasn't seeing
more than ~2GB RAM usage per process. Across 16 nodes I ran with 8 tasks per
node, so at 2GB each this is well under the minimum of 128GB RAM per node.

> * If you are running parallel with MPI and you have multiple GPUs per node,
> did you setup the DISPLAYs to leverage the GPUs?

As above, only 1 GPU per node, or 0 when switched to the OSMESA approach to try
with across more nodes.

As mentioned before, we can view a smaller version of the data without issue on
both GPU and OSMESA setups. I just opened a 4GB version (approx 25% of full size)
using the OSMESA setup on a single node (8 MPI tasks) without issue. The
responsiveness is really great - but the 16GB file is a no-go even scaling up 
across 16 nodes. The VTI itself seems fine, as slices and surface look as 
expected.

Thanks again for any and all suggestions!

Thanks Dave. Haven' t looked at your email in detail (will do in a moment)
but another thought would be some sort of limit we are hitting on the
indices (MAX_INT or MAX_<TYPE>) being used when dealing with very large
dataset such as yours.

Would it be possible for you to try OpenGL2 backend?

Aashish,

(sorry - didn't hit reply-all first time)

> Would it be possible for you to try OpenGL2 backend?

Yes - I can try this, but probably next week. I just change VTK_RENDERING_BACKENDS? Do you know if OSMESA has to be built with any particularly flags itself?

Thanks,

DT

I generated a script for in situ visualization with Catalyst. When running it in situ, I get the following error:
TypeError: RegisterView() takes exactly 9 arguments (8 given)

The line in question in the script is:

coprocessor.RegisterView(renderView1,
    filename='image_%t.png', freq=1, fittoscreen=0, magnification=1, width=1231, height=887)

I'm generated the script using ParaView 4.3.1, while the version of Catalyst used on the machine is 4.4 RC2, might that be the problem? If so what argument is missing? Can I simply manually add it in the script or should I re-generate the script with ParaView 4.4?

Thanks,

Matthieu

Matthieu,

That's indeed the case: try adding a `cinema={}` argument to the script.

Dave, can we fix this please? Scripts generated from 4.3.1 should work with
4.4 too.

I would say wait for 4.4.  No rush, I am just going through and closing bugs.  One needed ExternalData.   I probably won?t get back to it until 4.4 is out.

Since some of my LANs and clusters can?t see the outside world, I always manually pull the build files.  Thus, ExternalData is not in my build directory.

Is there a manual way to do the pull?

If you have built ParaView and let the build download the external data (the default options), then the files can be accessed from ExternalData in the build directory.

Hi,

I'm attaching my code.

This is a simple code that computes a "mandelbulb" fractal, and passes it to Catalyst for rendering. There is an example of data produced by this "simulation" in binary .raw format that can be read in ParaView (it contains a 60x60x61 array of int in BigEndian). I generated the script by opening this file, rendering a contour, and setting a few parameters such as background color, axis opacity, etc.
The code can be run by calling ./Madelbulb renderbulb.py

Thanks for your help,

Matthieu

I'll try and keep you posted.

(in the mean time I noticed a problem in the code I sent, I was using vtkDoubleArray instead of vtkIntArray. But after correction the same error is still present).

There is an example of data produced by this "simulation" in binary .raw format that can be read in ParaView (it contains a 60x60x61 array of int in BigEndian). I generated the script by opening this file, rendering a contour, and setting a few parameters such as background color, axis opacity, etc.
The code can be run by calling ./Madelbulb renderbulb.py

Thanks for your help,

Matthieu

Thanks, adding the argument removed the error, but now I have another one:

ERROR: In /home/mdorier/Catalyst-src/ParaViewCore/ServerImplementation/Core/vtkSIProxy.cxx, line 310
vtkSISourceProxy (0x34ad8a0): Failed to create vtkImageSliceRepresentation. Aborting for debugging purposes.
Aborted (core dumped)

Any idea how to solve this?

Thanks,

Matthieu,

That's indeed the case: try adding a `cinema={}` argument to the script.

Dave, can we fix this please? Scripts generated from 4.3.1 should work with 4.4 too.

Hi,

I generated a script for in situ visualization with Catalyst. When running it in situ, I get the following error:
TypeError: RegisterView() takes exactly 9 arguments (8 given)

The line in question in the script is:

coprocessor.RegisterView(renderView1,
    filename='image_%t.png', freq=1, fittoscreen=0, magnification=1, width=1231, height=887)

I'm generated the script using ParaView 4.3.1, while the version of Catalyst used on the machine is 4.4 RC2, might that be the problem? If so what argument is missing? Can I simply manually add it in the script or should I re-generate the script with ParaView 4.4?

Thanks,

Matthieu

Thanks Dan.

The image saved is 648 x 639 (see attached). What I am not understanding is
the relation between ViewSize, camera settings and actual image size in
pixels.

I would like to use paraview to render some textures that I will be using
in my code and I need the image ti fit perfectly the content.

What version of ParaView do you use? I run the script on a ParaView source
build from git master.


You should be able to do Tools / Start Trace, open your file and then save
it to the desired resolution. The script generated should tell you what
settings you need. You might need to uncomment the setting of the ViewSize.
This is what I had to do.

I am using the 4.3.1 binary version downloaded from the website. I
generated my script starting from the trace as you suggest. Uncommenting
the ViewSize on your script works. The fact is that it does not work on
mine and i really don't understand why. I guess it is related to the
settings of the camera.

Have you tried to run my script on your machine? I would expect to have a
square image with the data fitted perfectly into it, but as soon as I
increase the ViewSize above 855x855, only the horizontal size increases. As
you can see from the VTK the source data is 24x24.

Thanks

Subject: [Paraview] HPCWire Reader's Choice Awards. Please vote for VTK!
Message-ID: <CAE32kpUNhgwLy6-q98dZw6LCcRjyPEavR-3tX9MxeGKuvih9+g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi folks,

VTK and ParaView have been nominated for HPCWire Reader's Choice Awards in
the category of visualization:

http://www.hpcwire.com/2015-hpcwire-readers-choice-awards/

We would really appreciate your support and your vote this year. Although
both VTK and ParaView are nominated and we would appreciate very much folks
voting for either, we would like to encourage the ParaView community to
support VTK this year.

2015 has been a year of major advancement for VTK (and therefore ParaView
which leverages VTK heavily) in the area of HPC.

The most notable efforts towards next generation computing is VTK-m (
http://m.vtk.org/). This emerging effort, which significantly improves our
ability to compute on GPUs and massively multi-core CPUs, will be our main
infrastructure to support next generation supercomputers such as the
upcoming Cori, Trinity, Summit, Sierra and Aurora, all of which feature
massive parallelism through the use of GPUs of Intel Xeon Phi processors.

We have also a number of other efforts, including vtkSMP, which aims to
introduces multi-threaded parallelism and together with VTK-m help us close
any performance holds on multi-core systems, Intel IPCC with TACC which
focuses on better leveraging vector units on CPUs and last but not least
our next generation OpenGL efforts which focus on significant rendering
improvements on modern GPUs as well as Intel's upcoming OpenSWR software
rendering library.

As these technologies mature and are deployed over the next few months,
expect major performance boost in VTK and ParaView.

Thank you for your support.
Berk for the ParaView team

Ruggiero,
Attached is the script I used on ParaView master. It saves a 1000x1000 png.
I had to uncomment renderView1.ViewSize and change the magnification for
SaveScreenshot to 1.

Subject: [Paraview] Compiled Paraview - Seg Fault
Message-ID: <55F477E6.8060208@stanford.edu>

Hello,

I built Paraview from source on my workstation (Archlinux) with OpenMPI. 
The compilation process went smoothly, but when I try to run Paraview 
from /<build_dir>/bin/ I get "Segmentation fault (core dumped)"

If I switch to /<build_dir>/lib/paraview-4.4/ and run Paraview from 
there, I get "./paraview: error while loading shared libraries: 
libvtkpqApplicationComponents-pv4.4.so.1: cannot open shared object 
file: No such file or directory"

If I then add /<build_dir>/lib/ to my $LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment 
variable, I can successfully run Paraview from 
/<build_dir>/lib/paraview-4.4/, but the Paraview executable in 
/<build_dir>/bin/ still gives me a seg fault.

Any idea what I'm doing wrong?

Thanks,

Paul

Hi Richard,

Please keep your replies on the list with a "reply-all". Someone else may
have a similar question as you (or better yet, an answer) and this may come
in handy in a future search of the list serve.

I'm not sure how to annotate the position on the graph as you seek to do as
there is no mechanism for this. You could perhaps hack this in by creating
another column in your table where all the values are zero except for the
time that you are showing. Setting this column to the maximum of your
plotted y values in the row at the time you are showing would result in an
almost vertical line showing up at the time you are displaying if your data
samples in x are dense enough.

HTH,
Cory

Subject: [Paraview] WriteAllTimeSteps, print current TimeStep
Message-ID: <1442180129956.58422@sth.kth.se>

Dear all,


I have a very short python script to import a pvd-file (with associated .vtu-files) and simply save the same data in csv-format (see at the bottom of the message). Using:


writer.WriteAllTimeSteps = 1


I can easily make sure that paraview saves all my time steps in subsequent order (without introducing a loop). The script works fine, but as of now I just have to wait with no screen output whilst all files are created. My question is therefore, is there a way to print the current time step that is being saved, such that I can see the progress (if I want)? Is there some kind of write.WriteCurrentTimeStep?


Thanks for your help,


/David


SCRIPT:


from paraview.simple import *
import sys
import os
print "Importing "+sys.argv[1]
print "Creating "+sys.argv[2]
inp = os.getcwd()+"/"+sys.argv[1]
csv_output_directory = os.getcwd()+"/csv"
outp = csv_output_directory+"/"+sys.argv[2]
os.system('mkdir '+csv_output_directory)
reader = OpenDataFile(inp)
#writer = simple.CreateWriter("path/to/solution.csv", reader)
writer = CreateWriter(outp, reader)
writer.WriteAllTimeSteps = 1
writer.FieldAssociation = "Points"
writer.UpdatePipeline()
exit()

 4.3.1 Superbuild
Message-ID: <1442192142150.58127@spacex.com>

??Hello Paraview Users,


Having a bit of an issue with Paraview's Superbuild not packaging /usr/bin/paraview and other related binaries with the TGZ generator.


Full output truncated below, but one of the lines of "cpack -G TGZ" outputs,


Determining dependencies for 'pvbatch'.

This seems like it is related to the issue, as the binaries it packages are mostly headless, i.e.

/usr/bin/pvbatch
/usr/bin/pvdataserver
/usr/bin/pvpython
/usr/bin/pvrenderserver
/usr/bin/pvserver

?However,

/usr/bin/paraview is not in this list, nor the other binaries that I would expect when it is built.

I've attached my CMakeCache.txt to this email as it would be rather large to paste.

Any thoughts?

Thanks,
Anthony

It looks like you're not enabling Qt. I think qt was renamed to qt4
after 4.3.1 was released (when we tried using qt5, but we will have to
wait until at least 5.5.1 for some bugs). I'll check tomorrow when we
did the rename, but setting ENABLE_qt should work (check the list of
enabled projects during configure).

Thanks Dan.

Run you script through pvpython. No modifications apart from the filenames.
I still have an image with 1000x855 size (see attached).

I will try to build paraview from source to see if this changes.

Thanks

Subject: [Paraview] Segfault in ParaView 4.4 RC2
Message-ID: <37142D5FC373A846ACE4F75AA11EA84D21C0036D@DITKA.anl.gov>

Hi,

I compiled ParaView 4.4 RC 2 from sources on Debian (Linux 3.2.0-4-amd64, Debian 3.2.68-1+deb7u3 x86_64), in order to try Catalyst, but I got segmentation faults when Catalyst runs my python script. I initially thought something was wrong with my script but then I realized ParaView also creashes with the same segfault when I try to start it (I see the splashscreen, and the interface appears, but then it immediately crashes). The error reported is:

*** glibc detected *** /home/mdorier/local/paraview/lib/paraview-4.4/paraview: munmap_chunk(): invalid pointer: 0x00000000048e4970 ***

And a backtrace follows (which I attach. I wanted to get more info using the core dump but ParaView doesn't seem to have been compiled with -g so there is no other info).

Here is how I installed ParaView:

My compiler is gcc 4.7.2. MPI is Mpich 3.1.3.

I (apt-get) installed the packages:

libphonon-dev libphonon4 qt4-dev-tools libqt4-core libqt4-gui qt4-qmake libxt-dev g++ gcc cmake-curses-gui libqt4-opengl-dev mesa-common-dev python-dev

I then configured ParaView using ccmake; I attach the resulting CMakeCache.txt. Basically Catalyst and Python are turned ON, MPI as well, rendering backend is set to OpenGL.

I'm running on a virtual machine using VirtualBox, 3d acceleration is enabled, and
glxinfo | grep "OpenGL version"
returns
OpenGL version string: 1.4 (2.1 INTEL-10.6.31)

Thanks,

Matthieu

Hi Matthieu,

My hunch is that there is a problem with the OpenGL provided by VirtualBox
with 3D acceleration enabled. I have not found 3D acceleration to work well
with my Ubuntu 140.04 installation, so I just disable it.

Could you try disabling 3D acceleration and see if ParaView still crashes?

Thanks,
Cory

What Cory suggested may be it. I can't spot anything fishy in the
CMakeCache.txt. Also try running another OpenGL enabled app, eg.
glxgears to see if that works. I believe it's provided by the
`mesa-utils` package on Ubuntu.

Are you using a system libpng? What version is it?

[1]More surgical is "rm -rf install/ */src/*-stamp/*-install", but this
still has cases where it is insufficient.

Ben,

I had been using the system libpng version 1.2.52, but it appears `png_set_longjmp_fn` was not introduced until 1.6, so I tried building libpng 1.6.18 from source last night, which then allows Paraview to continue building with qt enabled, however, when running the built version, I get:

libpng warning: Application built with libpng-1.4.8 but running with 1.6.18

So it appears that there is some other version of libpng (maybe bundled in the superbuild?) that it was using to build.

Should I turn off use_system_png? Turn off ENABLE_png? Something else?

Thanks,
Anthony

Are you using a system libpng? What version is it?

[1]More surgical is "rm -rf install/ */src/*-stamp/*-install", but this
still has cases where it is insufficient.

Hi,

Indeed, disabling 3D acceleration makes ParaView work. I initially enabled it because when it's off, my Catalyst script gives me this:

OpenGL Warning: Failed to connect to host. Make sure 3D acceleration is enabled for this VM.

and the PNG image resulting from my script is just white (now that may be unrelated, maybe there is just a problem with my Catalyst adaptors...)

Also when running the simulation, I see a white-filled window briefly appearing an disappearing before this message shows up. This also happens when I run it through SSH (but I have to use the -X option in SSH, otherwise I get another error saying "bac X server connection").

Thank,

Matthieu

What Cory suggested may be it. I can't spot anything fishy in the
CMakeCache.txt. Also try running another OpenGL enabled app, eg.
glxgears to see if that works. I believe it's provided by the
`mesa-utils` package on Ubuntu.

Hey,

did you find a solution for this? I have a little smaller data set of
just around 3.4 billion cells in a 3D unstructured grid volume, climate
simulation data. It reads and displays the 2D slices (22 million cells
each) fine and quiet fast, but if I want to load all 150 slices, I get
this error message:

ERROR: In
/tmp/xas/build/paraview_paraview_4.3.1_default_gcc48/src/ParaView/VTK/Common/Core/vtkDataArrayTemplate.txx,
line 308
vtkIdTypeArray (0x3cecaf0): Unable to allocate 33587986431 elements of
size 8 bytes.

ParaView consumes around 2/3 of the systems memory by this time.

Cheers,
Niklas

Yeah, it looks like it built against the superbuild's libpng and running
against the one you grabbed. Other than a compiler and things like libc
or OpenGL, the superbuild *should* be providing everything it needs (and
it is not regularly tested against other external dependency versions).

> Should I turn off use_system_png? Turn off ENABLE_png? Something else?

Using the superbuild-provided png would probably be best
(-DUSE_SYSTEM_png=OFF -DENABLE_png=ON). However, it seems that removing
the 1.6.18 libpng should fix the warning.

Hi Niklas,

Your problem is different. It looks like one of the arrays in your data
requires 268GBs of memory. I expect that this is not the only data array so
the total dataset should be much bigger. You are going to need to do this
in parallel. I would not recommend more than 100M elements / node and
that's on the really high end where I assume that you have multiple MPI
ranks running per node.

Best,
-berk

Hmm,
I tried
~/ParaView-4.3.1-Linux-64bit/bin/pvpython test.py

and still created the right png - see attached.
I notice you have a different color palette. Why is that?

Ben,

After removing libpng 1.6.18 from my system (which I did AFTER doing a fresh recompile of paraview), I get the following message:

/usr/lib/paraview-4.3/paraview: error while loading shared libraries: libpng16.so.16: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

Which seems to indicate the build system linked against the system libpng even though USE_SYSTEM_png is set to off?

Thanks,
Anthony

Yeah, it looks like it built against the superbuild's libpng and running
against the one you grabbed. Other than a compiler and things like libc
or OpenGL, the superbuild *should* be providing everything it needs (and
it is not regularly tested against other external dependency versions).

> Should I turn off use_system_png? Turn off ENABLE_png? Something else?

Using the superbuild-provided png would probably be best
(-DUSE_SYSTEM_png=OFF -DENABLE_png=ON). However, it seems that removing
the 1.6.18 libpng should fix the warning.

I've now had chance to build paraview 4.3.1 with the OpenGL2 backend.

I've not been able to test on GPU accelerated nodes (cluster is too busy to get enough right now), but I have also built as an OSMESA with OpenGL2 version. Unfortunately the symptoms are the same. With the largest 16GB VTI I see wireframe etc, but switching to volume rendering results in nothing visible in the client. No messages from the server or client. Memory usage well below RAM in the systems. Runnning across 8 256GB 24-core nodes with 8-mpi tasks per node.

As with the OpenGL backend I go to our 9GB or 4GB downsampled VTIs and things work as expected. Great rendering performance running across the 8-node allocation with OpenMPI and OSMESA.

I did also come across another issue. Switching back to surface view on the 16GB data I had a crash shortly after I started manipulating the view with the mouse. I couldn't replicate this crash with the smaller datasets though.

ERROR: In /home2/dtrudgian/paraview/ParaView-v4.3.1-source/VTK/Rendering/OpenGL2/vtkShaderProgram.cxx, line 292

Yes - I can try this, but probably next week. I just change VTK_RENDERING_BACKENDS? Do you know if OSMESA has to be built with any particularly flags itself?

Thanks,

Thanks Dave. Haven' t looked at your email in detail (will do in a moment) but another thought would be some sort of limit we are hitting on the indices (MAX_INT or MAX_<TYPE>) being used when dealing with very large dataset such as yours.

Would it be possible for you to try OpenGL2 backend?

Sure - thanks for your help.

This is with Paraview 4.3.1

Have tried in two ways, both are using MPI (OpenMPI/1.8.3 on an InfiniBand FDR
network):

Setup 1) Paraview 4.3.1 pvserver is running with MPI across multiple cluster nodes, each with a Tesla K20 GPU. Only up to 4 nodes total, each one has a single Tesla K20. Have used various numbers of MPI tasks. The machines are 16 physical cores, with hyper-threading on for 32 logical cores. 256GB RAM and the Tesla K20 has 5GB.

... when this didn't work we did suspect out of GPU memory. Since we have a limited number of GPU nodes then decided to try the CPU approach...

Setup 2) Paraview 4.3.1 rebuilt with OSMESA support, to run pvserver on a larger number of cluster nodes without any GPUs. These are 16 or 24 core machines with 128/256/384GB RAM. Tried various numbers of nodes (up to 16) and MPI tasks per node, allowing for OSMESA threading per the docs/graphs on the Paraview wiki page.

Watching the pvserver processes when running across 16 nodes I wasn't seeing more than ~2GB RAM usage per process. Across 16 nodes I ran with 8 tasks per node, so at 2GB each this is well under the minimum of 128GB RAM per node.

> * If you are running parallel with MPI and you have multiple GPUs per

As above, only 1 GPU per node, or 0 when switched to the OSMESA approach to try with across more nodes.

As mentioned before, we can view a smaller version of the data without issue on both GPU and OSMESA setups. I just opened a 4GB version (approx 25% of full size) using the OSMESA setup on a single node (8 MPI tasks) without issue. The responsiveness is really great - but the 16GB file is a no-go even scaling up across 16 nodes. The VTI itself seems fine, as slices and surface look as expected.

Oooof... with typical luck,  as soon as I hit 'send' I went back to moving around on the surface view on the 9GB dataset and got the crash. I guess it's not due to the large 16GB file only:

Subject: RE: [Paraview] Volume Rendering 17GB 8.5 billion cell volume

I've now had chance to build paraview 4.3.1 with the OpenGL2 backend.

I've not been able to test on GPU accelerated nodes (cluster is too busy to get enough right now), but I have also built as an OSMESA with OpenGL2 version. Unfortunately the symptoms are the same. With the largest 16GB VTI I see wireframe etc, but switching to volume rendering results in nothing visible in the client. No messages from the server or client. Memory usage well below RAM in the systems. Runnning across 8 256GB 24-core nodes with 8-mpi tasks per node.

As with the OpenGL backend I go to our 9GB or 4GB downsampled VTIs and things work as expected. Great rendering performance running across the 8-node allocation with OpenMPI and OSMESA.

I did also come across another issue. Switching back to surface view on the 16GB data I had a crash shortly after I started manipulating the view with the mouse. I couldn't replicate this crash with the smaller datasets though.

Aashish,

(sorry - didn't hit reply-all first time)

Yes - I can try this, but probably next week. I just change VTK_RENDERING_BACKENDS? Do you know if OSMESA has to be built with any particularly flags itself?

Thanks,

DT

Thanks Dave. Haven' t looked at your email in detail (will do in a moment) but another thought would be some sort of limit we are hitting on the indices (MAX_INT or MAX_<TYPE>) being used when dealing with very large dataset such as yours.

Would it be possible for you to try OpenGL2 backend?

Sure - thanks for your help.

This is with Paraview 4.3.1

Have tried in two ways, both are using MPI (OpenMPI/1.8.3 on an InfiniBand FDR
network):

Setup 1) Paraview 4.3.1 pvserver is running with MPI across multiple cluster nodes, each with a Tesla K20 GPU. Only up to 4 nodes total, each one has a single Tesla K20. Have used various numbers of MPI tasks. The machines are 16 physical cores, with hyper-threading on for 32 logical cores. 256GB RAM and the Tesla K20 has 5GB.

... when this didn't work we did suspect out of GPU memory. Since we have a limited number of GPU nodes then decided to try the CPU approach...

Setup 2) Paraview 4.3.1 rebuilt with OSMESA support, to run pvserver on a larger number of cluster nodes without any GPUs. These are 16 or 24 core machines with 128/256/384GB RAM. Tried various numbers of nodes (up to 16) and MPI tasks per node, allowing for OSMESA threading per the docs/graphs on the Paraview wiki page.

Watching the pvserver processes when running across 16 nodes I wasn't seeing more than ~2GB RAM usage per process. Across 16 nodes I ran with 8 tasks per node, so at 2GB each this is well under the minimum of 128GB RAM per node.

> * If you are running parallel with MPI and you have multiple GPUs per

As above, only 1 GPU per node, or 0 when switched to the OSMESA approach to try with across more nodes.

As mentioned before, we can view a smaller version of the data without issue on both GPU and OSMESA setups. I just opened a 4GB version (approx 25% of full size) using the OSMESA setup on a single node (8 MPI tasks) without issue. The responsiveness is really great - but the 16GB file is a no-go even scaling up across 16 nodes. The VTI itself seems fine, as slices and surface look as expected.

Thanks again for any and all suggestions!

Yeah, it looks like it built against the superbuild's libpng and running
against the one you grabbed. Other than a compiler and things like libc
or OpenGL, the superbuild *should* be providing everything it needs (and
it is not regularly tested against other external dependency versions).

Using the superbuild-provided png would probably be best
(-DUSE_SYSTEM_png=OFF -DENABLE_png=ON). However, it seems that removing
the 1.6.18 libpng should fix the warning.

It seems to not be finding libpng.so even though it exists as a symbolic link to libpng14d.so.14.8.0, which does indeed exist.

Thoughts?

Trying yet another build from a completely clean working slate now.

Ooh. Are you compiling in Debug mode (empty is also usually "Debug") for
CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE? I don't think that's ever been tested. I'll add a
patch to have it default to Release.

I am not sure about the rest of the email, but the error you included is
typically caused by using too old of a version of mesa. I?m not sure about
specific driver/etc but I usually suggest trying Mesa version 10.5.5 or
later to see if that solves the issue.



Thanks

I've now had chance to build paraview 4.3.1 with the OpenGL2 backend.

I've not been able to test on GPU accelerated nodes (cluster is too busy to
get enough right now), but I have also built as an OSMESA with OpenGL2
version. Unfortunately the symptoms are the same. With the largest 16GB VTI
I see wireframe etc, but switching to volume rendering results in nothing
visible in the client. No messages from the server or client. Memory usage
well below RAM in the systems. Runnning across 8 256GB 24-core nodes with
8-mpi tasks per node.

As with the OpenGL backend I go to our 9GB or 4GB downsampled VTIs and
things work as expected. Great rendering performance running across the
8-node allocation with OpenMPI and OSMESA.

I did also come across another issue. Switching back to surface view on the
16GB data I had a crash shortly after I started manipulating the view with
the mouse. I couldn't replicate this crash with the smaller datasets though.

ERROR: In

Aashish,

(sorry - didn't hit reply-all first time)

> Would it be possible for you to try OpenGL2 backend?

Yes - I can try this, but probably next week. I just change
VTK_RENDERING_BACKENDS? Do you know if OSMESA has to be built with any
particularly flags itself?

Thanks,

DT

Thanks Dave. Haven' t looked at your email in detail (will do in a moment)
but another thought would be some sort of limit we are hitting on the
indices (MAX_INT or MAX_<TYPE>) being used when dealing with very large
dataset such as yours.

Would it be possible for you to try OpenGL2 backend?

Sure - thanks for your help.

This is with Paraview 4.3.1

Have tried in two ways, both are using MPI (OpenMPI/1.8.3 on an InfiniBand
FDR
network):

Setup 1) Paraview 4.3.1 pvserver is running with MPI across multiple
cluster nodes, each with a Tesla K20 GPU. Only up to 4 nodes total, each
one has a single Tesla K20. Have used various numbers of MPI tasks. The
machines are 16 physical cores, with hyper-threading on for 32 logical
cores. 256GB RAM and the Tesla K20 has 5GB.

... when this didn't work we did suspect out of GPU memory. Since we have a
limited number of GPU nodes then decided to try the CPU approach...

Setup 2) Paraview 4.3.1 rebuilt with OSMESA support, to run pvserver on a
larger number of cluster nodes without any GPUs. These are 16 or 24 core
machines with 128/256/384GB RAM. Tried various numbers of nodes (up to 16)
and MPI tasks per node, allowing for OSMESA threading per the docs/graphs
on the Paraview wiki page.

Watching the pvserver processes when running across 16 nodes I wasn't
seeing more than ~2GB RAM usage per process. Across 16 nodes I ran with 8
tasks per node, so at 2GB each this is well under the minimum of 128GB RAM
per node.

> * If you are running parallel with MPI and you have multiple GPUs per
> node, did you setup the DISPLAYs to leverage the GPUs?

As above, only 1 GPU per node, or 0 when switched to the OSMESA approach to
try with across more nodes.

As mentioned before, we can view a smaller version of the data without
issue on both GPU and OSMESA setups. I just opened a 4GB version (approx
25% of full size) using the OSMESA setup on a single node (8 MPI tasks)
without issue. The responsiveness is really great - but the 16GB file is a
no-go even scaling up across 16 nodes. The VTI itself seems fine, as slices
and surface look as expected.

Thanks again for any and all suggestions!

Ben,

I was indeed compiling in Debug mode! Is there a different recommended way to compile the application in debug mode then?

Trying the build now in release.

Not cleanly. I can add a flag for that as well.

Currently, once ParaView is done configuring, stop the build, edit

Looks like building for release worked properly, the resulting Paraview runs fine now.

Thanks much for your help!

Not cleanly. I can add a flag for that as well.

Currently, once ParaView is done configuring, stop the build, edit
paraview/src/paraview-build/CMakeCache.txt to have
CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Debug (though RelWithDebInfo is probably
sufficient and not dog slow), and then continue the build at the
top-level again.

Run you script through pvpython. No modifications apart from the filenames. I still have an image with 1000x855 size (see attached).
I will try to build paraview from source to see if this changes.

Have you tried to run my script on your machine? I would expect to have a square image with the data fitted perfectly into it, but as soon as I increase the ViewSize above 855x855, only the horizontal size increases. As you can see from the VTK the source data is 24x24.

You should be able to do Tools / Start Trace, open your file and then save it to the desired resolution. The script generated should tell you what settings you need. You might need to uncomment the setting of the ViewSize. This is what I had to do.

The image saved is 648 x 639 (see attached). What I am not understanding is the relation between ViewSize, camera settings and actual image size in pixels.
I would like to use paraview to render some textures that I will be using in my code and I need the image ti fit perfectly the content.

The problem is that the `ViewSize` seems to be ignored and I keep having images of fixed size 1707???855. The height 855 seems to be a kind of limit; the only way to get what I want is to limit the `ViewSize` to 855x855.
I have checked [this][2] question and [this][3] question, but with no success.
Any idea? I am not very confident in the settings for the camera. Could this be the issue??

I was wandering because I thought you used a different script than what I
sent. If you only changed the palette it should not make a difference. I am
on Linux. Maybe there is a problem with screenshot saving on MacOS. Maybe
someone else with a mac could try this. If not, I am in the process of
getting a mac laptop, I'll try to remember to try this out when I get my
new laptop.

I have noticed that if I run the script in paraview python shell the size
settings are ignored and the UI settings are used instead - in my case
648x639. If I run it from pvpython with paraview closed then the size will
be 1000x855 or whatever horizontal resolution i specify x 855.

Thanks

Hmm, strange. Can you post a stack trace?

Thanks,

Hey Cory

Thanks for the tip with the array [(0,0,0) .... (0,0,0),
(x,y,time),(0,0,0)...(0,0,0)] While this was easy to do, I still get a
point in Paraview at 0/0 for each time, or, if I choose to draw a line, one
that starts at 0/0 - which is kind of understandable, when looking at my
table, which is 0 everywhere but on one point. Can you give me another hint
on how to proceed? I only want PV to draw ONE point at (x,y)...

Thanks
Richard

If I go to the download page ,  I can download something called '4.4
(Latest Stable)' which to me implies that?s still a development build and
not the final production release?

Hmm...I was using it to point to the "latest stable" release. I
suppose I'll just remove the text to avoid confusion .... fixed.

Matthieu,

> - If I run the application from the VM's graphical interface, it runs fine. It only gives me the OpenGL warning I mentioned before. BUT the generated file has a big black area (see image_2.png attached). Also I see a window appear for a brief moment with the correct (full) view, then it disappears. I don't know why I get that.

I've seen this happen with the view size is greater the X window size.
Try changing the ViewSize to something small, say 200x200. Does that
work? If so, you'd need to change the X window size. Other option
would be build with OSMesa support. Since you're only using this build
for Catalyst, OSMesa will circumvent all the X related issues you've
been seeing on this VM.

I am going to try your code to see if i can reproduce this one. I'll
get back to you shortly.

In an attempt to clear my bug backlog, I revisited this issue. I am happy
to report that this is now fixed. I am even happier to report that I didn't
have to do anything. It seems like our overhaul of the ghost information
addressed it. The version I tested is several months all so this is
definitely fixed in 4.4.

Best,

NVM...those were from your original tarball. I thought they were
generated as an output from my run :). It's indeed an X issue in both
cases. Couple of options:

1. Do a Mesa3D build locally on the VM. Then set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to
point to the generated OpenGL libs and run ParaView/Catalyst. That'll
avoid using the GL libraries provided by virtualbox.
2. Do a OSMesa build and then rebuild ParaView/Catalyst to use OSMesa.
That'd mean you can't have the Qt UI in the same build, but Catalyst
and other scripting executables will work. That would avoid the X
issue all together. This Wiki [a] describes how to get a OSMesa
enabled ParaView build.

Subject: [Paraview] Permissions issue with
	ParaView-4.4.0-Qt4-Linux-64bit.tar.gz
Message-ID: <CABKpNRVZukDBc3gvTZJu7upCRPkPcHsM-hREy-V+bZkrST0wEQ@mail.gmail.com>

After unpacking ParaView-4.4.0-Qt4-Linux-64bit.tar.gz I was unable to
launch it. Attempting to launch it from the command line resulted in:

$ /opt/ParaView-4.4.0-Qt4-Linux-64bit/lib/paraview-4.4/paraview
/opt/ParaView-4.4.0-Qt4-Linux-64bit/lib/paraview-4.4/paraview: error
while loading shared libraries: libGenericIO.so: cannot open shared
object file: No such file or directory

Turns out that ParaView-4.4.0-Qt4-Linux-64bit/lib/paraview-4.4/libGenericIO.so
had the following permissions:

-rwx------. 1 1001 1001   378310 Sep 14 15:36 libGenericIO.so

So the fix is simple:

chmod a+r ~/shared/ParaView-4.4.0-Qt4-Linux-64bit.tar.gz

To be clear, I had installed it as,

sudo tar xvzf ~/Downloads/ParaView-4.4.0-Qt4-Linux-64bit.tar.gz -C /opt

Had I unpacked it without sudo, it would have run fine, although just
for me, not for other users.

Hope this is useful to others who might run into this minor issue.

Oops, correction to that previous post. The actual fix (bit of a
sledgehammer) is

sudo chmod -R a+rx /opt/ParaView-4.4.0-Qt4-Linux-64bit/

Richard,

I understand. Sorry, I don't think there is a way to do this.

Having an annotation mechanism for your use case might be something we can
do in the future, but there are currently no plans to do this that I know
of.

Best,
Cory

Thanks a lot Utkarsh!

In the mean time I tried my code on the Blue Waters machine at NCSA and it works like a charm, so yes, it has to be the VM. I'll try with OSMesa. I don't need the ParaView GUI on the VM anyway.

Thanks,

Matthieu

NVM...those were from your original tarball. I thought they were
generated as an output from my run :). It's indeed an X issue in both
cases. Couple of options:

1. Do a Mesa3D build locally on the VM. Then set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to
point to the generated OpenGL libs and run ParaView/Catalyst. That'll
avoid using the GL libraries provided by virtualbox.
2. Do a OSMesa build and then rebuild ParaView/Catalyst to use OSMesa.
That'd mean you can't have the Qt UI in the same build, but Catalyst
and other scripting executables will work. That would avoid the X
issue all together. This Wiki [a] describes how to get a OSMesa
enabled ParaView build.

I am not sure about the rest of the email, but the error you included is typically caused by using too old of a version of mesa. I?m not sure about specific driver/etc but I usually suggest trying Mesa version 10.5.5 or later to see if that solves the issue.

I've now had chance to build paraview 4.3.1 with the OpenGL2 backend.

I've not been able to test on GPU accelerated nodes (cluster is too busy to get enough right now), but I have also built as an OSMESA with OpenGL2 version. Unfortunately the symptoms are the same. With the largest 16GB VTI I see wireframe etc, but switching to volume rendering results in nothing visible in the client. No messages from the server or client. Memory usage well below RAM in the systems. Runnning across 8 256GB 24-core nodes with 8-mpi tasks per node.

As with the OpenGL backend I go to our 9GB or 4GB downsampled VTIs and things work as expected. Great rendering performance running across the 8-node allocation with OpenMPI and OSMESA.

I did also come across another issue. Switching back to surface view on the 16GB data I had a crash shortly after I started manipulating the view with the mouse. I couldn't replicate this crash with the smaller datasets though.

Aashish,

Yes - I can try this, but probably next week. I just change VTK_RENDERING_BACKENDS? Do you know if OSMESA has to be built with any particularly flags itself?

Thanks,

Thanks Dave. Haven' t looked at your email in detail (will do in a moment) but another thought would be some sort of limit we are hitting on the indices (MAX_INT or MAX_<TYPE>) being used when dealing with very large dataset such as yours.

Would it be possible for you to try OpenGL2 backend?

Sure - thanks for your help.

This is with Paraview 4.3.1

Have tried in two ways, both are using MPI (OpenMPI/1.8.3 on an InfiniBand FDR
network):

Setup 1) Paraview 4.3.1 pvserver is running with MPI across multiple cluster nodes, each with a Tesla K20 GPU. Only up to 4 nodes total, each one has a single Tesla K20. Have used various numbers of MPI tasks. The machines are 16 physical cores, with hyper-threading on for 32 logical cores. 256GB RAM and the Tesla K20 has 5GB.

... when this didn't work we did suspect out of GPU memory. Since we have a limited number of GPU nodes then decided to try the CPU approach...

Setup 2) Paraview 4.3.1 rebuilt with OSMESA support, to run pvserver on a larger number of cluster nodes without any GPUs. These are 16 or 24 core machines with 128/256/384GB RAM. Tried various numbers of nodes (up to 16) and MPI tasks per node, allowing for OSMESA threading per the docs/graphs on the Paraview wiki page.

Watching the pvserver processes when running across 16 nodes I wasn't seeing more than ~2GB RAM usage per process. Across 16 nodes I ran with 8 tasks per node, so at 2GB each this is well under the minimum of 128GB RAM per node.

> * If you are running parallel with MPI and you have multiple GPUs per
> node, did you setup the DISPLAYs to leverage the GPUs?

As above, only 1 GPU per node, or 0 when switched to the OSMESA approach to try with across more nodes.

As mentioned before, we can view a smaller version of the data without issue on both GPU and OSMESA setups. I just opened a 4GB version (approx 25% of full size) using the OSMESA setup on a single node (8 MPI tasks) without issue. The responsiveness is really great - but the 16GB file is a no-go even scaling up across 16 nodes. The VTI itself seems fine, as slices and surface look as expected.

Thanks again for any and all suggestions!

I just realized you are on PV 4.3.1, that version is probably old enough
that we did not have OpenGL2 working with Mesa back then. Updating to a
more recent PV/VTK will be needed to use OpenGL2 with Mesa (I think we got
it working three or four months ago). As far as I know the 10.6 versions of
Mesa should also work fine, anything after 10.5.4 should be good.



Sorry for the confusion

16GB data I had a crash shortly after I started manipulating the view with
the mouse. I couldn't replicate this crash with the smaller datasets though.

Yes - I can try this, but probably next week. I just change
VTK_RENDERING_BACKENDS? Do you know if OSMESA has to be built with any
particularly flags itself?

Thanks,

Thanks Dave. Haven' t looked at your email in detail (will do in a moment)
but another thought would be some sort of limit we are hitting on the
indices (MAX_INT or MAX_<TYPE>) being used when dealing with very large
dataset such as yours.

Would it be possible for you to try OpenGL2 backend?

Sure - thanks for your help.

This is with Paraview 4.3.1

Have tried in two ways, both are using MPI (OpenMPI/1.8.3 on an InfiniBand
FDR
network):

Setup 1) Paraview 4.3.1 pvserver is running with MPI across multiple
cluster nodes, each with a Tesla K20 GPU. Only up to 4 nodes total, each
one has a single Tesla K20. Have used various numbers of MPI tasks. The
machines are 16 physical cores, with hyper-threading on for 32 logical
cores. 256GB RAM and the Tesla K20 has 5GB.

... when this didn't work we did suspect out of GPU memory. Since we have a
limited number of GPU nodes then decided to try the CPU approach...

Setup 2) Paraview 4.3.1 rebuilt with OSMESA support, to run pvserver on a
larger number of cluster nodes without any GPUs. These are 16 or 24 core
machines with 128/256/384GB RAM. Tried various numbers of nodes (up to 16)
and MPI tasks per node, allowing for OSMESA threading per the docs/graphs
on the Paraview wiki page.

Watching the pvserver processes when running across 16 nodes I wasn't
seeing more than ~2GB RAM usage per process. Across 16 nodes I ran with 8
tasks per node, so at 2GB each this is well under the minimum of 128GB RAM
per node.

> * If you are running parallel with MPI and you have multiple GPUs per
> node, did you setup the DISPLAYs to leverage the GPUs?

As above, only 1 GPU per node, or 0 when switched to the OSMESA approach to
try with across more nodes.

As mentioned before, we can view a smaller version of the data without
issue on both GPU and OSMESA setups. I just opened a 4GB version (approx
25% of full size) using the OSMESA setup on a single node (8 MPI tasks)
without issue. The responsiveness is really great - but the 16GB file is a
no-go even scaling up across 16 nodes. The VTI itself seems fine, as slices
and surface look as expected.

Thanks again for any and all suggestions!

I just realized you are on PV 4.3.1, that version is probably old enough that we did not have OpenGL2 working with Mesa back then. Updating to a more recent PV/VTK will be needed to use OpenGL2 with Mesa (I think we got it working three or four months ago). As far as I know the 10.6 versions of Mesa should also work fine, anything after 10.5.4 should be good.

Sorry for the confusion

Am currently using Mesa 10.5.4 as I?d seen that as a working config mentioned somewhere on the web, so will try newer. Any reason to avoid the 10.6 series?

I guess I should also try moving to Paraview 4.4 now :-)

I am not sure about the rest of the email, but the error you included is typically caused by using too old of a version of mesa. I?m not sure about specific driver/etc but I usually suggest trying Mesa version 10.5.5 or later to see if that solves the issue.

I've now had chance to build paraview 4.3.1 with the OpenGL2 backend.

I've not been able to test on GPU accelerated nodes (cluster is too busy to get enough right now), but I have also built as an OSMESA with OpenGL2 version. Unfortunately the symptoms are the same. With the largest 16GB VTI I see wireframe etc, but switching to volume rendering results in nothing visible in the client. No messages from the server or client. Memory usage well below RAM in the systems. Runnning across 8 256GB 24-core nodes with 8-mpi tasks per node.

As with the OpenGL backend I go to our 9GB or 4GB downsampled VTIs and things work as expected. Great rendering performance running across the 8-node allocation with OpenMPI and OSMESA.

I did also come across another issue. Switching back to surface view on the 16GB data I had a crash shortly after I started manipulating the view with the mouse. I couldn't replicate this crash with the smaller datasets though.

I compiled and installed Mesa locally (Gallium llvmpipe state-tracker), but when compiling ParaView I get this error:

make[2]: *** No rule to make target `/home/mdorier/local/mesa/lib/libGLU.so', needed by `lib/libIceTGL.so'.  Stop.

It appears that libGLU.so is not built by Mesa. Is this normal? (I'm not familiar with Mesa at all) Should GLU be downloaded and compiled from somewhere? Or is there an option in Mesa?

(I've used Mesa 11.0.0)

Thanks,

Matthieu

In the mean time I tried my code on the Blue Waters machine at NCSA and it works like a charm, so yes, it has to be the VM. I'll try with OSMesa. I don't need the ParaView GUI on the VM anyway.

Thanks,

Matthieu

NVM...those were from your original tarball. I thought they were
generated as an output from my run :). It's indeed an X issue in both
cases. Couple of options:

1. Do a Mesa3D build locally on the VM. Then set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to
point to the generated OpenGL libs and run ParaView/Catalyst. That'll
avoid using the GL libraries provided by virtualbox.
2. Do a OSMesa build and then rebuild ParaView/Catalyst to use OSMesa.
That'd mean you can't have the Qt UI in the same build, but Catalyst
and other scripting executables will work. That would avoid the X
issue all together. This Wiki [a] describes how to get a OSMesa
enabled ParaView build.

Hey David,

I am hoping to have some time to play around with volume rendering and
hopefully tracking this issue, one thing that I wanted to clarify: it
sounds from you description that you have a short (2 byte) value. Is that
correct?

Thanks,

Hi,

We have been experimenting with using Paraview to display very volumes from very
large TIFF stacks generated by whole-brain microscopy equipment. The test stack
has dimensions of 5,368x10,695x150. Stack is assembled in ImageJ from individual
TIFFs, exported as a RAW and loaded into paraview. Saved as a .vti for
convenience. Can view slices fine in standalone paraview client on a 256GB machine.

When we attempt volume rendering on this data across multiple nodes with MPI
nothing appears in the client. Surface view works as expected. On switching to
volume rendering the client's display will show nothing. There are no messages
from the client or servers - no output.

This is happening when running pvserver across GPU nodes with NVIDIA Tesla
cards, or using CPU only with OSMESA. pvserver memory usage is well below what
we have on the nodes - no memory warnings/errors.

Data is about 17GB, 8 billion cells. If we downsize to ~4GB or ~9GB then we can
get working volume rendering. The 17GB never works regardless of scaling
nodes/mpi processes. The 4/9GB will work on 1 or 2 nodes.

Am confused by the lack of rendering, as we don't have memory issues, or an
other messages at all. Am wondering if there are any inherent limitation, or I'm
missing something stupid.

Thanks,

Dave Trudgian

Matthieu,

Simply set the CMake variable OPENGL_glu_LIBRARY to empty. I think
you're pointing it to non-existant
/home/mdorier/local/mesa/lib/libGLU.so and hence the issue. If I am
not mistaken, GLU is optional only required for certain tests.

Subject: [Paraview] Problem with pvd/vtu --> csv convert
Message-ID: <1442385243923.81516@sth.kth.se>

Hi everyone,


I'm currently using paraview to simply open a pvd-file (with corresponding vtu-files) and saving the data as csv-files (that is Save Data, writing all time steps). My file consists of ~1000 time slices so the save data has to go through quite a lot of input/output files.


When I look at my vtu-files they all look good and I can view the data in e.g. spreadsheet format inside Paraview. However, when saving the output it manages only the first few files and then prompts on the likes of (in this case, solution.28.csv represents the 29th frame):


ERROR: In /home/kitware/Dashboards/MyTests/NightlyMaster/ParaViewSuperbuild-Release/paraview/src/paraview/ParaViewCore/VTKExtensions/Default/vtkCSVWriter.cxx, line 82
vtkCSVWriter (0x6409f60): Unable to open file: /path/to/my/output/solution.28.csv


This error is then prompted for the rest of the output files.


Does anyone know what might cause this problem?


Thanks in advance for the help


/David

Dear all,

after installing the final version of Paraview 4.4 I don't find the
option to enable the parallel projection. Any tips?

PS: the option is activated in the "json" properties file, but the new
version of Paraview seems doesn't read it.

Thanks,

Gaspare

Gaspare,

The option "Camera Parallel Projection" is available as an Advanced option
(click on the gear wheel to show advanced option) of the View panel (in the
Properties panel).

Subject: [Paraview] partitioned vtu and polyhedral cells
Message-ID: <HE1PR01MB1354212DE5DF30B30D4034B3E35B0@HE1PR01MB1354.eurprd01.prod.exchangelabs.com>

Good morning,
I write the result of my parallel simulation on octree grids in vtu files (one per process), only using hexahedra, and I collect them in a pvtu file.
My data are collocated on the cell centers.
In order to use the Contours filter of Paraview, I firstly apply the CleanToGrid filter, then the CellDataToPointData filter and at the end the Contours one.
By this way I can avoid discontinuous contours at process boundaries, but I can't avoid contour discontinuities at grid level jumps.

In order to overcome this problem, I tried to write my grid using polyhedra/hexahedra at grid level jumps and only hexahedra elsewhere.
If I open any single vtu file, I can see all the cells I wrote in that file. But on a single vtu mixing polyhedra and hexahedra if I apply the following pipelines
CellDataToPointData -> Contours
or
CellDataToPointData -> Slice
the last filter show the result in the hexahedra.
What happens inside polyhedra?

Moreover, If I open the pvtu file I cannot see polyhedra, even if asking paraview for grid information I get the right number of cells.
What about polyhedra in this case???

Lastly, I decided to do something working in any case. I open my pvtu with only hexahedra.
Therefore I call the following pipeline,
CleanToGrid -> CellDataToPointData -> Delaunay 3D -> Contours
The result is not discontinuous, but at grid level jumps my contours oscillate. These ones are better than discontinuous ones, but ....

Any suggestion about how to get continuous and smooth contours in cell-centered octree grids are appreciated.

Thanks for your attention,

Marco Cisternino

Subject: [Paraview] Axes Grid bug with 2D surfaces
Message-ID: <55F98A8B.7030102@gmail.com>

Hi,

I encountered an issue with the new Axes Grid in ParaView 4.4.0.  When I
open my 2D unstructured data file and just switch on the Axes Grid by
selecting the checkbox right next to "Edit Axes Grid ..." I get a white
frame around my surface, but the labels and ticks are missing (see
snapshot1.png).  When I start rotating the surface the labels and ticks
appear (see snapshot2.png).

I cannot reproduce this issue with the wavelet source, hence I attached
a subset of my dataset as .vtu file.  With this dataset the the bug is
reproducible.

For now I will resort to the "Cube Axes", but it would be nice to have
this resolved in the future.

Best regards,
Armin

There's a workaround: uncheck "Label Unique Edges Only" in the "Edit
Axes Grid" dialog. It's an advanced property, so you'll need to search
for it or use the "gear" button in the  dialog. You can futher
customize the sides to label using "Axes to Label". State file
attached.

Wow! Thanks for the very quick response!

Indeed the suggested workaround fixes this issue, there were just too
many options already in the basic settings that I didn't find the right
one to adjust this from the advanced settings.


Also, now that I started to play with this, I would have two suggestions
for improving the otherwise very nice Axes Grid:

1) Adjusting the font, color, etc. for all axes together in one step.
Currently I have to change e.g. the color 6 times, which is quite
tedious if I just quickly want to adjust the color of the axes.

2) Changing the origin of the "Axes Grid". In the old "Cube Axes" this
was easily done by adjusting the "Custom bounds".


Thanks for the great effort you are putting into developing ParaView!

Best regards,
Armin

Subject: [Paraview] Possible bug in recent SuperBuild?
Message-ID: <55F9C666.4030401@lanl.gov>

I'm attempting to build an HPC deployed Paraview 4.4 with 
the Cosmotools plugin, I believe I've figured out the proper 
sequence of toggles to make it available in an interactive 
'ccmake' build process.

One issue is that I need to independently grab the source 
and other needed package files onto my workstation and then 
push them onto our HPC platforms.  I've been able to grab 
'cosmotools' and 'qhull' with no issue, but the needed 
'genericio' Git repo as written in the versions.cmake file 
seems to have troubles if I perform a manual 'git clone' on it:

 > git clone https://kwgitlab.kitware.com/paraview/genericio.git
Cloning into 'genericio'...
fatal: unable to access 
'https://kwgitlab.kitware.com/paraview/genericio.git/': 
Couldn't resolve host 'kwgitlab.kitware.com'

That's what I get from NERSC's hopper system (given they 
aren't as strict as we are dealing with Internet access from 
HPC systems). I get a different error on my LANL office 
workstation that accesses the Internet via proxy, but I'm 
assuming its the name name resolution problem.

If I get rid of the 'kw' in the 
'https://kwgitlab.kitware.com' part, I am able to connect, 
but then prompted for a username and password. That didn't 
happen when I tried the same on the 'diy' Git repo:

git clone https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/diy.git
Cloning into 'diy'...
remote: Counting objects: 2415, done.

I'll leave it at that for now.

PS: when you respond, please delete my original message from 
the response. One of the frustrating issues I have with the 
Paraview mail-list digests is scrolling through the huge 
amount of redundant "quoted" original messages in every 
single entry.

Thank you for your time.

Giovanni,

kwgitlab in internal Gitlab not accessible to computers outside Kitware
network. Some of the external projects are hosted there since the licensing
issues. I believe GenericIO recently went opensource. So you should be able
to update the URL in versions.cmake to the one reported here:
http://trac.alcf.anl.gov/projects/genericio.

Hi Giovanni,

kwgitlab is the kitware-internal instance of gitlab.  We were hosting the
genericio project there while it was not open sourced.  The base code has
now been open sourced by ANL at the address Utkarsh linked to, but I
haven't had time to get the changes that kitware has made to the library
upstreamed to the version hosted at ANL yet.  Unfortunately ParaView needs
these changes.  It is on my todo list...

Subject: [Paraview] Send an array from client to server
Message-ID: <50320452A334BD42A5EC72BAD21450993C81D2F9@MBX110.d.ethz.ch>

I'm afraid I've forgotten how to write plugins for paraview and I have a simple-ish question :

I've got a vtkUnsignedIntArray in my custom panel and I'd like to set it as a property on a reader,
the reader has a member
vtkSetObjectMacro(SelectedGIDs)

and in the panel I've generated a list of IDs, but I cannot recall how I'm supposed to set them as the proxyproperty for the source.

Is there an example (I do remember that I don't want to use an IntVectorProperty, but pass a whole array as a proxy property)

(I'm considering using a vtkSelection, but the GIDs are not the same as the cell Ids, so I wanted to try a direct array method first)

thanks

JB

How big is the array? For 100s of values, I'd say IntVectorProperty is
still reasonable. Any other approach will mean that those values are not
going to get saved in state files and such. For a one off push to server
side for values you don't care to be saved in state files, you can directly
call API using the vtkClientServerStream on the proxy as follows:

  vtkClientServerStream stream;
  stream << vtkClientServerStream::Invoke
              << VTKOBJECT(proxy)

  for (int cc=0; cc < maxValues; cc++)
    {
    }

(please confirm the API, but this is pretty close to what it would look like)

That's great, these values are temporary and possibly large, so saving them in state files is not required. I'll try your snippet and report back

cheers

Subject: [Paraview] Legend and labels
Message-ID: <001b01d0f157$a97a07a0$fc6e16e0$@lucas@gantha.com>

Dear all,

 

I have two question regarding legends and labels in ParaView and the way to
adjust them in a Python script.

 

1) Is it possible to adjust the spacing between the Title Texts and the
labels ?

 

2) Is it possible to adjust the labels' font size ?

 

Thank you in advance for your help.

 

Jean-Michel

True. I couldnt' decide if they should be separate or combined. I
opted for separate since it allows for nice viz like this
(http://www.kitware.com/blog/files/48_97946856.png). BTW, you can use
the "Save current values as default" button on the bottom left corner
of the dialog to preserve your setup between multiple ParaView runs.

You should be able to use the "Data Transform" group of properties for
a similar effect.

I tried this, but couldn't get the desired result. I attached an
screenshot and state file to show what I'm after (using the old Cube axes).

The "Data Transform" changes the labels but doesn't shift the axes.

Message-ID: <CAPGv+dMfTNL-nqAMGSqJoFkjfU8S4DvUE2DB3KAUpLPqWvNO+g@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

     I'm relatively new to Paraview and I had a question concerning getting
Paraview to run on a Linux machine from source and adding vrpn. I
downloaded and built both I believe, and I am using ccmake to build it.
When I run ccmake and then try and generate however, I get an error at the
end stating:

WARNING: Target "VRPlugin" requests linking to directory
"/home/ajs2987/Projects/ParaviewOnStallion/vrpn-07.33-bin/lib".  Targets
may link only to libraries.  CMake is dropping the item.

Any particular reason why this would be happening or how to fix it? Any
help would be appreciated.

Thanks
Andrew Solis

Hi Andrew,

What is the value of your VRPN_LIBRARY variable? I suspect it is

"/home/ajs2987/Projects/ParaviewOnStallion/vrpn-07.33-bin/lib"

when it should be something like

"/home/ajs2987/Projects/ParaviewOnStallion/vrpn-07.33-bin/lib/libvrpn.a"

The key is to point VRPN_LIBRARY to the VRPN library.

HTH,
Cory

That's indeed not supported. As mentioned in the blog post [1], the
Axes Grid is intended for the entire scene, and not for a specific
dataset. Certain implementation choices (esp for supporting parallel
rendering with distributed data) require that the axes bounds are
always greater or equal to all the data being rendered in the scene.

OK, I see. Thanks a lot for the clarification.

Subject: [Paraview] Plot Cell ID over time
Message-ID: <55FC1898.4020201@student.ethz.ch>

Dear paraviewers,

I am analyzing 2D tissue data and I would like to count the number of 
cells over time. After I extract a polygonal mesh from my multiblock 
dataset I want to visualize the polygonal mesh statistics which show the 
number of cells at every time point. Unfortunately, I cannot find a way 
to plot the selected Cell ID column over time (see screenshot here: 
http://imgur.com/LICqYdV ). Any suggestions on how to get around this?

Thanks in advance !

With best regards,
Marco

Message-ID: <95c805a4948e4c20a7fb868ab4db0b87@MAR190n2.marin.local>

Hi,

I noticed that when I load a .vtm file, I cannot select which data fields to load. This requires me to load the entire file into memory, after which the Pass Arrays filter allows me to take the required data field forward in the pipeline. If I load other formats (e.g. CGNS and .vtu) I can choose which field to load.

Maybe I?m missing something obvious? Should there be metadata on the fields in the vtm file that is missing?

Thanks and best wishes,

Subject: [Paraview] Plot Cell ID over time
Message-ID: <D2217925.28209%kmorel@sandia.gov>

Macro,

I'm not entirely sure what you are expecting to happen when you select a
column and as ParaView to plot it over time. ParaView will take statistics
over the id values and give you a quartile plot on that. I don't think
that is what you want. From the earlier part of your email, it sounds like
you really want to plot the number of cells over time. To do that, you
first need to compute the cell count into some sort of data structure.
Unfortunately there is no direct way to do this, but I found an old email
thread 
(http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2008-November/010080.html)
that describes how to leverage the histogram filter to do it. Here are
some updated instructions for ParaView 4.4.

1. Run your data through the Histogram filter. Set "Bin Count" to 1. Make
"Select Input Array" point to a cell variable. Apply. The result should be
a histogram with exactly one bin.

2. View the data in the Spreadsheet view. Close all the views and then
select "Spreadsheet View" in the resulting empty view. Make sure the
Histogram filter is visible in the spreadsheet view. There should be a
single row. Select that row so that it is highlighted. (Note, this is only
necessary because issue 14978 is not implemented yet.
http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=14978)

3. Add the Plot Selection Over Time filter. Apply.

Hello,

thanks for your answer. Unfortunately, there is no cell variable. So I 
can't point "Select Input Array" to anything useful. I found another 
difficult way though to achieve my goal: First I select the Last Frame, 
then Edit -> Find Data, there I choose "Find Cell(s) from Extract 
Block", "ID is >=0", "Block ID is 1", "Run Selection Query" and then 
"Plot Selection Over Time". If I then open the Spreadsheet View, I find 
a dataset containing (among other columns) the number of cells N and the 
Time. If I the toggle all unnecessary columns, select all entries in my 
two columns and then Filters -> Data Analysis -> Plot Data, I finally am 
close to what I wanted to visualize. If anyone knows a less laborious 
way, please let me know. Thanks in advance.

Best regards,
Marco

Hi Aashish,

All other stereo is working fine.

Unrelated to this issue, I have always built ParaView with mesa, but I was getting sluggish graphics performance. I am currently testing a ParaView build WITHOUT mesa and now I find that Crystal Eyes stereo is working perfectly.

It seems like mesa was NOT using the graphics hardware and that was preventing Crystal Eyes stereo from working.

Shouldn't mesa be using the graphics card?

Kind regards,
Jim

Hello Jim,
Before spending too much time tracking this down as an error, and just to be sure, are you trying to do this with "3D Vision" or "3D Vision Pro"? The regular 3D Vision does not have OpenGL capabilities and so will not give you stereo. If you are using 3D Vision Pro, then I defer to the ParaView gurus...

Cheers,
Eric

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView in stereo with NVidia 3D Vision


Good afternoon everyone,

I have been trying to use ParaView in stereo using NVidia 3D Vision glasses but I am seeing an error. I am using ParaView version 4.3.1 on Linux built using Superbuild.

I have been launching ParaView as follows:

    paraview --stereo --stereo-type="Crystal Eyes"

When ParaView starts I see the following error message:

ERROR: In <path>/build/paraview/src/paraview/VTK/Rendering/OpenGL/vtkOpenGLCamera.cxx, line 167
vtk OpenGLCamera (0x33c9940): failed after Render 1 OpenGL errors detected
  0 : (1282) Invalid operation

Is this a problem with how I am trying to use ParaView, or is it a bug? Is there anything that I can try to get stereo working?

Thanks,
Jim

Macro,

That does seem like a better way to go about it. I think you can shorten
your steps by about half. Try these steps. The first 3 are the exact same
as you describe.

1. Edit -> Find Data.

2. Find Cells where ID is >= 0 (and any other selection criteria). "Run
Selection Query"

3. "Plot Selection Over Time." "Apply"

4. In the resulting plot view, edit the Series Parameters to turn off all
variables except "N".

Utkarsh

Apologies, I didn?t get  chance to try this properly until now, When I
call this 

vtkClientServerStream stream;
  stream << vtkClientServerStream::Invoke
    << VTKOBJECT(proxy)
    << "SetSelectedGIds"
  << numValues;
  stream.InsertArray(data, numValues);
  stream << vtkClientServerStream::End;

Inside my client server generated wrapper is this code

if (!strcmp("SetSelectedGIds",method) && msg.GetNumberOfArguments(0) == 4)
    {
    int      temp0;
    vtkClientServerStreamDataArg<int    > temp1(msg, 0, 3);
    if(msg.GetArgument(0, 2, &temp0) &&
      temp1)
      {
      op->SetSelectedGIds(temp0,temp1);
      return 1;
      }
    }

Which is generated from


  void SetSelectedGIds(int N, const int *Ids);

But when I step though the received message, the msg parameter only has
GetNumberOfArguments == 3


If I adjust the client server wrapped code to accept 3 args instead of 4,
then the numValues looks correct, but the pointer is wrong.

Q1 : why does the message only have 3 params when the wrapper wants 4
Q2 : What should I change? I guess that something else needs to be
inserted into the stream, but after having a poke round, I couldn?t guess
what.

Thanks

JB

Hi Cory,

I wish to have the y-axis whose range is from 0 to 1 to take the whole of
display window(in the y-direction) and similarly the x- axis whose range is
from 0 to 180 to take the whole of the display window in the x-direction.
Is there any way I could do it?

Thanks.

Regards,
Kaushik

Message-ID: <D2239291.90D32%biddisco@cscs.ch>

I made some progress, but have not solved the problem.
The stream insertion from the gui generates 3 params, type size and the
array itself.
The cxx client server wrapper expects a size and a pointer, 2 params (+the
two for the objected etc)
The wrapper needs to be tricked into producing code for a
vtkClientServerStreamDataArg<int> object which exists during wrapping, but
not in normal code.
So adding 

#define VTK_WRAPPING_CXX
#include "vtkClientServerStream.h"


And later 

void SetSelectedGIds(int Ids[]);
//BTX
  void SetSelectedGIds(vtkClientServerStreamDataArg<int> &temp0);
//ETX

With the appropriate cxx function to extract the array, does work in that
it tricks the wrapper code into calling the function with the
client/server int array, but there are two problems

1) the pointer from the arg object is always NULL
2) we don?t know the size as the clientserverwrapperarg object doesn?t
store it, it only uses it during the constructor to allocate space then
passes the raw pointer on via the type T pointer. I can add this to the
wrapper class and then get the size (if I can find out and fix why the
pointer is always NULL).

I don?t really believe it should be this hard to pass an int pointer with
a known length from client to server, o I?d welcome any info that
simplifies this.

Thanks

JB

Just following up so that when I?ve forgotten how to do it ...

This works

#define VTK_WRAPPING_CXX
#include "vtkClientServerStream.h"

...


//  void SetSelectedGIds(int n, const int *Ids);
  void SetSelectedGIds(int N, int Ids[]);
//BTX
  void SetSelectedGIds(int N, vtkClientServerStreamDataArg<int> &temp0);
//ETX

And in the cxx, use the vtkClientServerStreamDataArg operator () to get
the T* pointer.

Then in the client GUI

vtkClientServerStream::Array array =
  {
    vtkClientServerStream::int32_array,
    static_cast<vtkTypeUInt32>(numValues),
    
static_cast<vtkTypeUInt32>(sizeof(vtkClientServerStream::int32_value)*numVa
lues),
    (int*)(data)
  };


  vtkClientServerStream stream;
  stream << vtkClientServerStream::Invoke
    << VTKOBJECT(proxy)
    << "SetSelectedGIds"
    << numValues
    << array;
  stream << vtkClientServerStream::End;

This correctly inserts the array and the type,size,data vars so that the
server reads them as expected.

I?m not happy about the fact that we have to spoof the wrapper generators,
but at least I don?t need to modify the ClientServerStreamArg<>
implementation.

Subject: [Paraview] Isosurfaces with Hex elements
Message-ID: <CAPxeKp9_v2-3Dj_FbGMhDP2eVeX0=fcfeRR7CS=yEomHL2fgxQ@mail.gmail.com>

It appears I have run into an issue with generating isosurfaces from Hex
elements. I am visualizing high order data, which is discontinuous at the
element interfaces, but continuous within each of the subdivisions used to
visualize the element.

If I create a volumetric isosurface I often get large discontinuities.
However, If I create a slice of the volumetric data and then take an
isosurface of the slice, I obtain isolines without large discontinuities.
When I visualize the isolines and isosurfaces simultaneously, they do not
intersect as they should. It seems very odd that taking a slice and then
taking the isosurface of the slice produces the correct result, while
taking the volumetric isosurface does not.

I think the issue stems from the fact that the isosurfaces for Hexes are
generated by the marching cubes algorithm, which can fail if there are
trilinear terms. I've implemented my own isosurface generation algorithm,
with the same results. I assume some kind of fix has been implemented for
the slice feature or isosurface algorithm in 2D. Can anyone confirm this?
And if so, is there a plan to implement a more robust Hex isosurface
algorithm? Or perhaps I'm on the wrong track here...

Thank you for looking,

John

Hi,

I am using pvbatch to automatically generate a few screenshots. I would
like to perform these operation completely in the background, but for each
generated screen there is a window that opens and then closes when the
script ends.

I have tried the option offscreen-rendering but I think it is for something
different.

Thanks

Subject: How to perfectly fit data in a screenshot

Hi,

Just in case someone is interested I report here my solution. The 855 seems
to be a limit for the vertical size. The limit is actually 855 x
magnification. This is good because at least is constant.

To perfectly fit an image with these characteristics:

xc,  yc,  zc = Focus
width, height = Actual dimensions in meters

You can calculate these parameters

ratio = height / width
magnification = 2 (or whatever value you need)
height_p = 855 * magnification
width_p = int(height_p * 1.0 / ratio / magnification)

Then you can use (apart from all the other settings)

renderView1.ViewSize = [width_p , height_p]
renderView1.InteractionMode = '2D'
renderView1.CameraPosition = [xc, yc, 10000.0 + zc]
renderView1.CameraFocalPoint = [xc, yc, zc]
renderView1.CameraParallelScale = (height / 2.0)  (Notice this is the
orginal height in meters)

And finally

SaveScreenshot(output_file, magnification=magnification, quality=100,
view=renderView1)

I don't really understand the value 855, but it doesn't matter anymore.

Cheers
Ruggiero

John,

That looks too convoluted. I haven't done this in a while so I'll need
to refresh my memory a bit. I'll make an example today and then get
back to you.

Subject: [Paraview] 400GB dataset out of memory on 1k cores?
Message-ID: <201509211329.t8LDTG1j091742@mech-as222.men.bris.ac.uk>

I get OOM on a ~400GB raw dataset
that I process with a script below.
I use 24 core nodes with 64GB per node.
I tried using up to 1008 nodes.

My question: Will increasing the number of
cores/nodes help?
Or is there some serial operation involved
that will not be helped this way?

Thank you

Anton

Hey there,

I simulate 2D tissue growth and use ParaView to visualize the data. I 
would like to plot the time dependence of the area of a polygonal mesh. 
But I can't find a way to do that. Any suggestions would be much 
appreciated.

Thanks in advance,
Marco

I would be grateful for some advice on volume and surface rendering in Paraview.

I am trying to generate 3D skull models from CT data.  The reason for using Paraview is to take advantage of the detailed fly-through/movie capability.  I can generate an acceptable 3D model that I can interact with in OsiriX and 3D Slicer, both of which I believe use VTK.  However, in Paraview I am struggling to create a 3D model that looks any good.

When I apply a threshold filter and view as a ?Surface? the image is a lot more ?blocky? than in the other two applications.  The image is dominated by the artifactual lines due to the original data being acquired as axial slices; whereas in OsiriX and 3D Slicer this gets smoothed out and the ?genuine? surface skull features (sutures etc) stand out.  

I realise this is probably question of apply the correct series of filters and that the other two apps do this ?under the hood?.  However, i have tried to apply Decimation and Smooth to the extracted surface and am not making any headway.

Any pointers would be very welcome

As far as I can see, the information needed sits in Information -> 
Bounds ->  X range Y range. Just don't know how I could extract it.

Try using the "Contour" filter instead of Threshold. That will give
you a surface mesh. If you want to generate a volumetric dataset, use
the "Clip" filter with "Clip Type" set to Scalar and then enter the
scalar value to clip at.

Subject: [Paraview] Multi-tiled Distributed Display
Message-ID: <CAPGv+dO-svC=mRq85QysGf-Zg5+TxHTNNWLdDnOJzNTBnoSMxA@mail.gmail.com>

Hey everyone,

     I'm trying to run Paraview using the vrpn plugin so that I can show
off Paraview on a distributed multi-tiled display, and I'm stuck on getting
it set up. The head machine is named stallion and there are 20 different
nodes that control 4 different screens horizontally that make up a 16x5
display. I'm trying to get Paraview to run on just one server machine as a
test and have been following the documentation on Immersiver Paraview found
at http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Immersive_ParaView. I've set up my pvx file
to be like so:

<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<pvx>

  <Process Type="client">
    <!-- Stallion Head Node -->
    <Machine Name="stallion"
             Environment="DISPLAY=:0"
             Geometry="1280x1000+0+0"
             ShowBorders="1" />
  </Process>

  <Process Type="server">
    <!-- Stallion distributed multi-tiled display -->
    <Machine Name="s01"
             Environment="DISPLAY=:0"
             FullScreen="1"
             ShowBorders="0" />
  </Process>

</pvx>

where s01 is one of the machines I'm using to show off with FullScreen
declared so Paraview is shown on all four screens the server controls
horizontally. What I'm confused about now is probably stupid, but now that
I have my pvx set up I want to test and see if I can get it to show on my
display, but I'm not sure how. I'm also relatively new to using vrpn so I
didn't know if I needed to set up anything with that as well beyond
installing the vrpn plugin. Please feel free to let me know if I explained
something wrong or if I need to answer any other questions, and any help
will be greatly appreciated.

Thanks!

Ruggiero,
I believe you have to make a custom build with OSMesa.  That way you are using a software framebuffer, rather than the one attached to your monitor.  Then, you run with the offscreen-rendering flag.

Hi,

I am using pvbatch to automatically generate a few screenshots. I would like to perform these operation completely in the background, but for each generated screen there is a window that opens and then closes when the script ends.

I have tried the option offscreen-rendering but I think it is for something different.

Thanks

On everest at ornl we have different displays for each of the screens
controlled by a node.

Then we mpiexec multiple processes per node.
mpiexec -hosts 8 s01 4 s02 4 pvserver -tdx=4 -tdy=1 tile.pvx

Then start the client and connect to the root node of the server (s01
presumably) through the connect dialog box.

Subject: [Paraview] Saving with Solid Color information
Message-ID: <CAE=GJrZXUfSZ7yKjpehVR7usju-QoNTK9CdFDdWF=TZD2n7pXw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

My question is simple, but I can't figure it out an easy way to do it !

I want to save a SourceBox with the Solid Color that I've picked from the
Select Colors dialog box.

After picking a color and saving the dataset, the Solid Color info is not
saved.

Is there a way of doing what I want to?

Thanks in advance.

Hi Anton,

Let's debug this a big. I suspect that the thresholds are the issue here.
Does this script work?

ext1    = 4640       # data extent along 1
ext2    = 4650       # data extent along 2
ext3    = 4650       # data extent along 3
ffile   = "./large/1000/zf5.raw" # fracture file
imsize1 = 1200         # size, in pixels, of the resulting image along 1
imsize2 = 1200         # size, in pixels, of the resulting image along 2

cor1 = 0.5 * ext1
cor2 = 0.5 * ext2
cor3 = 0.5 * ext3

from paraview.simple import *

# the extents start from zero, so need to lower
# the upper extents by 1
cracks = ImageReader( FilePrefix= ffile )
cracks.DataExtent=[ 0, ext1-1, 0, ext2-1, 0, ext3-1 ]
cracks.DataByteOrder = 'LittleEndian'
cracks.DataScalarType = 'int'

RenderView1 = GetRenderView()
DataRepresentation1 = Show()

If this works, let's discuss how to avoid using Threshold but get the same
result. The issue with Threshold is that it creates a volume as an
unstructured grid, which is heavy-weight. For example, a ~40KB volume (one
float variable) turns into a ~800KB if I extract all of it as an
unstructured grid. It seems like all you need is to extract the interfaces
between the grains, correct?

Best,
-berk

Message-ID: <CAKrZ8ydQANXo4QKqdgj5KnXL-BmUMfgtZb-LfoDhTCe7nBZyaA@mail.gmail.com>

I want to read a VTR file and work with its data. In my case it has 3
Components,

source = XMLRectilinearGridReader(FileName=['test.vtr'])
arrayName = 'M'
arrayComponents = 3
data = source.GetCellDataInformation()
array = data.GetArray(arrayName)
dataRange = array.GetRange(component)
FieldData = source.GetFieldData()
print FieldData

gives me:

Now I would like to access this data, best case for me would be if I can
use it in numpy, with the

from vtk.util.numpy_support import vtk_to_numpy

methods...

Or should I work with a Programmable Filter Option instead?

Thanks

Subject: [Paraview] Select which fields to load when loading .vtm multi-block

Hi,

I noticed that when I load a .vtm file, I cannot select which data fields to load. This requires me to load the entire file into memory, after which the Pass Arrays filter allows me to take the required data field forward in the pipeline. If I load other formats (e.g. CGNS and .vtu) I can choose which field to load.

Maybe I?m missing something obvious? Should there be metadata on the fields in the vtm file that is missing?

Thanks and best wishes,

Subject: [Paraview] Custom filter: exposed properties of a Calculator filter
Message-ID: <001e01d0f516$2f71fef0$8e55fcd0$@lucas@gantha.com>

Hi,

 

I am trying to create a Custom Filter in ParaView 4.3.1.

 

I am having trouble with the exposed properties of a Calculator filter: when
defining the properties for my custom filter, I am selecting the "Function"
property and setting the property name for this Calculator. However, when
using the custom filter, this property name does not appear in the
Properties panel of the Object Inspector. Is this a known bug or is there
something I'm missing ?

 

Also, is it possible to hide the calculator buttons and only leave the blank
field ? This was the default behavior in (at least) ParaView 3.12.0.

 

Thank you for your help.

 

Jean-Michel

Subject: [Paraview] Quadrangles and Q_1,1 basis functions
Message-ID: <56016504.5060305@gmail.com>

Hi!

I have defined a 2d quadrangle mesh consisting of 2x2 elements, with
Q_1,1 basis functions in GetFEM++, and exported an example function to
ASCII VTK format. The only node at which the example function is nonzero
is the middle one.

When I open the VTK file in Paraview, it looks as if it has used some
kind of triangle interpolation. Instead of its support being the entire
mesh, it has become zero near two opposite domain corners. In
particular, the result should have been 90-degree rotation symmetric
about the centre node.

How do I get Paraview to display this Q_1,1 function correctly, or at
least without it seemingly being interpolated onto a triangular mesh?

I'm using Paraview 4.3.1 and the ASCI VTK file generated by GetFEM++ is:

# vtk DataFile Version 2.0

Hmmm. It doesn't look like there is support for array selection in that
reader. We should add it... Can you make a feature request in the bug
tracker?

Hi Berk,

sorry for replying via online gmail, it will probably screw up the context.
I deleted your mail by accident from mbox, so have to resort to this...

Anyway, I haven't tried your script yet, but you are probably correct
about the threshold.
I have another script working on the same dataset (see below),
which runs fine. That script only shows the surface.

You ask "extract the interfaces between the grains, correct?"
If I understand you right, then no.
Please see here the expected image from a smaller dataset:
 http://eis.bris.ac.uk/~mexas/cgpack/201509res/crgb.png
I want to show all elements of the 3D array (dataset) with
particular values in particular colours. In my case yellow
for all cells (array elements) with value 0:

cracks100.ThresholdRange = [ 0, 0 ]
DataRepresentation3 = Show()
DataRepresentation3.DiffuseColor = [1.0, 1.0, 0.0]

green for all cells with value -1:

cracks110.ThresholdRange = [ -1, -1 ]
DataRepresentation4 = Show()
DataRepresentation4.DiffuseColor = [0.0, 1.0, 0.5]

and semi-transparent purple all cells with value 2:

Threshold1 = Threshold()
Threshold1.ThresholdRange = [ 2, 2 ]
DataRepresentation2 = Show()
DataRepresentation2.DiffuseColor = [ 1, 0, 1 ]

And I'd like to show the cells not as individual points,
but link adjacent cells into some sort of surface.

I my case green and yellow are cracks on different crystallographic planes,
and purple are grain boundaries.

Many thanks for your help

Anton

Hi

I downloaded the Paraview app and put it in a folder. Then I tried following instructions on this page: http://www.paraview.org/ParaView3/Doc/Nightly/www/py-doc/quick-start.html

export PYTHONPATH=/Applications/ArmandoApps/paraview.app/Contents/Python:$PYTHONPATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/Applications/ArmandoApps/paraview.app/Contents/Libraries/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

and I get this error:

Python 2.7.10 (default, Sep 14 2015, 23:52:44)

    from vtkCommonCorePython import *
ImportError: No module named vtkCommonCorePython
>>>

When i add vtk subfolder also to PYTHONPATH, I get this error:

ImportError: dlopen(/Applications/ArmandoApps/paraview.app/Contents/Python/vtk/vtkCommonCorePython.so, 2): Library not loaded: @executable_path/../Libraries/libvtkCommonCorePython27D-pv4.3.1.dylib
  Referenced from: /Applications/ArmandoApps/paraview.app/Contents/Python/vtk/vtkCommonCorePython.so
  Reason: image not found

vtkCommonCorePython.so is present in LD_LIBRARY_PATH set earlier.

So question is: Am I following correct instructions ?

I guess there are three scenarios I would be working with in coming days:

1. python code to run default python.app on my local MacOS, read H5Part file and visualize it.
2. python code to run compiled python on my cluster
3. python code to run compiled python server on my cluster

I dont know yet what would the difference in 2nd and 3rd point but for now I am trying to write a python script that would start python and open a file and visualize it.

Any help would be highly appreciated.

Regards

Amit

Hi Amit,

Since you appear to be using OSX, the environment variable you want is
DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH, not LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

Thanks for the help. When I set DYLD now the idle stops working:

fluid:~ armando$ export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/Applications/ArmandoApps/paraview.app/Contents/Libraries/:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
fluid:~ armando$ export PYTHONPATH=/Applications/ArmandoApps/paraview.app/Contents/Python/vtk:/Applications/ArmandoApps/paraview.app/Contents/Python:$PYTHONPATH
fluid:~ armando$ idle
** IDLE can't import Tkinter.
Your Python may not be configured for Tk. **

I have python and py-tkinter installed using macports and if I open a new terminal, idle just works fine.

I am searching on Macports / python and other forums? if anyone on paraview list has encountered it before please let me know.

Regards

Hi Amit,

Since you appear to be using OSX, the environment variable you want is DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH, not LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

Hi

I downloaded the Paraview app and put it in a folder. Then I tried following instructions on this page: http://www.paraview.org/ParaView3/Doc/Nightly/www/py-doc/quick-start.html

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/Applications/ArmandoApps/paraview.app/Contents/Libraries/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

and I get this error:

When i add vtk subfolder also to PYTHONPATH, I get this error:

vtkCommonCorePython.so is present in LD_LIBRARY_PATH set earlier.

So question is: Am I following correct instructions ?

I guess there are three scenarios I would be working with in coming days:

1. python code to run default python.app on my local MacOS, read H5Part file and visualize it.
2. python code to run compiled python on my cluster
3. python code to run compiled python server on my cluster

I dont know yet what would the difference in 2nd and 3rd point but for now I am trying to write a python script that would start python and open a file and visualize it.

Any help would be highly appreciated.

Hmmm. We are not exactly on the same wavelength :-) When you run a
threshold filter, you indeed get a volume with all the cells of a given
grain id. However, when you show it as a Surface (the default mode),
ParaView extracts the outer surface of that volume. Which ends up being
equivalent to showing all the interfaces between grains. To actually see
_all_ of the elements, you need volume rendering. Can you send me a small
dataset so I can demonstrate the difference in some pictures.

Best,

Subject: [Paraview] Running programmabile filter on ipython parallel
	environment
Message-ID: <C8921E2F87E8024BBD6C59CB07C0F47D2F150756@AAI-EXCH-MBX1.campus.unibe.ch>

Hi,
I am trying  paraview on ipython parallel but I am having some problems with the ProgrammableFilter and ProgrammableSource. I have attached a simple example .
I am running  ipython 3.2.1  on windows (but I had the same problem with ipython 4.0 on RHEL) and paraview4.3.1. I am using  the ipython cluster as described in http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/stable/parallel/parallel_intro.html#getting-started and http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/stable/parallel/magics.html#engines-as-kernels (in the attached example only 1 engine running locally)

When I call UpdatePipeline on the engine I get:
Traceback (most recent call last)<string> in <module>()
ImportError: __import__ not found

I guess it's something similar to http://stackoverflow.com/a/3949812 , as if the script of the programmable source is run by "eval" and the builtins are not imported. But I don't understand why the behaviour is different, since it runs correctly in the local shell. I've also tried interactive debugging but I am not getting to the frame where the exception occur. Do you have any suggestion?
Thank you
Livia

Yes yes, you are right of course!
This is what I meant.
I don't want volume rendering, but
the surfaces of all volumes (clusters, blobs) of cells
of certain value.

I put a small xz-compressed dataset here:
http://eis.bris.ac.uk/~mexas/0.txz

This is a raw binary file
with extents 312, 312, 310.
I'm sorry I haven't had the time to make a really small dataset.
Let me know if this is too big.

I read the data as

ext1    = 312
ext2    = 312
ext3    = 310
ffile   = <whatever you save it as>
from paraview.simple import *
cracks = ImageReader( FilePrefix= ffile )
cracks.DataExtent=[ 0, ext1-1, 0, ext2-1, 0, ext3-1 ]
cracks.DataByteOrder = 'LittleEndian'
cracks.DataScalarType = 'int'

Many thanks for your help

Message-ID: <bcf6603591c84249a83f325f0e6b0e8b@FE-MBX1011.de.bosch.com>

Hi

for some visualizations of unsteady fluid flow data I used to set particle tracer with the following pipeline:

volume data ==> Temporal Interpolator ==> ParticleTracer (with Input:Temporal Interpolator, seed source: some Point or Plane).

This worked fine up to Paraview version 4.1.0. However, in both versions 4.3.1 and 4.4.0 Paraview crashes after setting up the pipeline during the step to next timestep. It behaves like this on both Unix and Windows (64bit).
Any comments or hints on this? Do I have to set up the pipeline differently in the new versions?
Any help would be highly appreciated

Regards,

Markus

Not to my knowledge, but that'd certainly be a good feature to add. In
any case, all the files to download are listed in versions.cmake

All,

So, I have tried this in v4.4, hoping for a better result, but no  joy.  I have attached a picture showing how far off this seems to be.    Maybe it will reveal my error.

Hi Leonardo,

Are you saving a state file (File -> Save State)? State files are the
mechanism for saving display properties like color. Color information is
not saved with the data if you save the data only (File -> Save Data).

Hope that helps,
Cory

There is this weird behaviour :

fluid:~ armando$ export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/lib
fluid:~ armando$ idle

idle works just fine even if I point DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH to anything? as in above example /lib

But when I set it to paraview:

fluid:~ armando$ export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/Applications/ArmandoApps/paraview.app/Contents/Libraries/
fluid:~ armando$ idle
** IDLE can't import Tkinter.
Your Python may not be configured for Tk. **

I get tkinter error.

Any ideas anyone please ?

I have python and py-tkinter installed using macports and if I open a new terminal, idle just works fine.

I am searching on Macports / python and other forums? if anyone on paraview list has encountered it before please let me know.

Since you appear to be using OSX, the environment variable you want is DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH, not LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

Hi

I downloaded the Paraview app and put it in a folder. Then I tried following instructions on this page: http://www.paraview.org/ParaView3/Doc/Nightly/www/py-doc/quick-start.html

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/Applications/ArmandoApps/paraview.app/Contents/Libraries/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

When i add vtk subfolder also to PYTHONPATH, I get this error:

  Reason: image not found

vtkCommonCorePython.so is present in LD_LIBRARY_PATH set earlier.

So question is: Am I following correct instructions ?

I guess there are three scenarios I would be working with in coming days:

1. python code to run default python.app on my local MacOS, read H5Part file and visualize it.
2. python code to run compiled python on my cluster
3. python code to run compiled python server on my cluster

I dont know yet what would the difference in 2nd and 3rd point but for now I am trying to write a python script that would start python and open a file and visualize it.

Any help would be highly appreciated.

Regards

Amit

Hi Jean-Michel,

In response to your questions:

Unfortunately, no. This is a fixed spacing.

2) Is it possible to adjust the labels' font size ?
>

Yes. To change the labels' font size, open the Color Map Editor and find
the button with the color bar and the letter "e". Clicking on this will
bring up a dialog that lets you change the font size of the labels
(Text/Annotation Font Properties). Note that the font size is more of a
recommendation - ParaView will pick a font size for the label based on size
constraints and the number of digits in the label format.

Cheers,
Cory

Jean-Michel,

I am not able to reproduce what you are reporting with 4.3.1 or 4.4.

Did you remember to click the + sign when adding the property? The first
time I tried I forgot to do that, and the Function property was not exposed
in my custom filter. When I did add the property, it was exposed.

HTH,

Hi Cory,

 

Thank you for your answer.

 

I did remember to click the + sign, and in fact the property shows fine when playing the filter later on. Only the property name, which you can choose when designing the filter, doesn't appear in ParaView 4.3. If I open the same custom filter in ParaView 3.12, the name does show up.

 

Best,

Jean-Michel

I am having trouble with the exposed properties of a Calculator filter: when defining the properties for my custom filter, I am selecting the "Function" property and setting the property name for this Calculator. However, when using the custom filter, this property name does not appear in the Properties panel of the Object Inspector. Is this a known bug or is there something I'm missing ?

 

Also, is it possible to hide the calculator buttons and only leave the blank field ? This was the default behavior in (at least) ParaView 3.12.0.

Hi Cory,

 

Thank you for these answers.

I have indeed been fiddling about with the color map editor, but I had hope for a way to fix the labels' font size regardless of these constraints from the legend size and label format.

Hey Torquil S?rensen,
You will get the desired solution once you change "POINT_DATA 9" to
"CELL_DATA 4".
And then similarly specifying the data in each of the cell. In this case I
suppose the .vtk file for you should be-


# vtk DataFile Version 2.0

ASCII
DATASET UNSTRUCTURED_GRID
POINTS 9 float
 0 0 0
 0.5 0 0
 0 0.5 0
 0.5 0.5 0
 1 0 0
 1 0.5 0
 0 1 0
 0.5 1 0
 1 1 0

CELLS 4 20
 4 0 1 3 2
 4 1 4 5 3
 4 2 3 7 6
 4 3 5 8 7

CELL_TYPES 4

CELL_DATA 4


SCALARS scalarField float 1

Hi!

Thank you very much for the suggestion, but in that case I seem to end
up with a function that is constant within each square in the mesh.

A general Q_1,1 function can have different values in each of the four
corners of each square, and in the interior it is a first order
polynomial w.r.t. each of the variables x and y.

Does Paraview support the display of such a function which is not
necessarily constant within each square?

Best regards,
Torquil S?rensen

Jean-Michel,

As it happens, I'm currently working on a new implementation of the color
legend that will use a fixed font size to give you more control over the
color legend display. It should be available in ParaView 5.0.

Cheers,
Cory

Jean-Michel,

Thank you for clarifying, I think I understand now. So you see the
calculator buttons and text field for entering the expression? And you want
the name of the property to appear in the label?

For this property, a custom widget is used in the Properties panel that
does not display the property name. Hence, the property name does not show
up. I see that in 3.14 the Function is displayed with a simple text field -
you don't get the calculator buttons.

We'd have to change the custom widget to display the property name. This
would be a relatively simple change that I could walk you through if you'd
like to contribute to the ParaView source code.

Let me know if you are interested.

Thanks,
Cory

Hi Kaushik,

Thanks for following up.

You didn't saw what kind of plot you want to make, so I'll just describe
how to do this for a Scatter Plot.

First, load your data. Then choose Filters -> Scatter Plot. In the
Properties panel, look for the option "Left Axis Use Custom Range" and
check the box. In the range parameters that appear fill in 0 for "Left Axis
Range" and 1 for the second "Left Axis Range" (hmm, those names should be
fixed). Next, look for "Bottom Axis Use Custom Range", check the box, and
fill in 0 for "Bottom Axis Range Minimum" and 180 for "Bottom Axis Range
Maximum".

HTH,
Cory

Hi,

I think you should *add* the Paraview
path to the environment variable. Now
you overwrite it. So the typical syntax
is (bash):

export avar=adir:$avar

(Send from my phone, so I hope the formatting is reasonable).

Sounds great!

Another feature that would be nice would be the ability to choose manually the labels you want to appear on the legend (somewhat similar to the annotations) but maybe I'm getting a bit carried away here!

 

Cheers,

Jean-Michel,

 

As it happens, I'm currently working on a new implementation of the color legend that will use a fixed font size to give you more control over the color legend display. It should be available in ParaView 5.0.

 

Cheers,

Cory

Hi Cory,

 

Thank you for these answers.

I have indeed been fiddling about with the color map editor, but I had hope for a way to fix the labels' font size regardless of these constraints from the legend size and label format.

Hi Jean-Michel,

 

In response to your questions:

 

1) Is it possible to adjust the spacing between the Title Texts and the labels ?

 

Unfortunately, no. This is a fixed spacing.

 

2) Is it possible to adjust the labels' font size ?

 

Yes. To change the labels' font size, open the Color Map Editor and find the button with the color bar and the letter "e". Clicking on this will bring up a dialog that lets you change the font size of the labels (Text/Annotation Font Properties). Note that the font size is more of a recommendation - ParaView will pick a font size for the label based on size constraints and the number of digits in the label format.

 

Cheers,

Cory

 

 

Thank you in advance for your help.

 

Jean-Michel

I?m doing some test build of PV 4.4.0, and if I try to build using QT5, I need to have access to the libxcb libraries.    It doesn?t look like there?s an RPM for this for RHEL5 .    Can the Superbuild script be tweaked to pick up the sources for this dependent library and build it if it can?t find it on the system?     Otherwise, at least on RHEL5, I?ll need to download/build outside of the Superbuild?

Cory,

 

Thank you for your answer, you understood my problem perfectly. I noticed the problem is somewhat similar when trying to incorporate a Python calculator to a custom filter and exposing the property name (in this case, the name remains 'Expression' no matter what you specify when creating the filter). 

 

The reason I asked this question is that I need to design a filter that asks some input from the user before performing some calculations. The way I used to do this was by creating a calculator with the name of the quantity the user has to give.

 

However, I'm afraid I'm not sufficiently skilled in C++ to delve into custom widgets. I'll try to find a workaround.

 

Thanks again,

Jean-Michel

Jean-Michel,

 

Thank you for clarifying, I think I understand now. So you see the calculator buttons and text field for entering the expression? And you want the name of the property to appear in the label?

 

For this property, a custom widget is used in the Properties panel that does not display the property name. Hence, the property name does not show up. I see that in 3.14 the Function is displayed with a simple text field - you don't get the calculator buttons.

 

We'd have to change the custom widget to display the property name. This would be a relatively simple change that I could walk you through if you'd like to contribute to the ParaView source code.

 

Let me know if you are interested.

 

Thanks,

Cory

Hi Cory,

 

Thank you for your answer.

 

I did remember to click the + sign, and in fact the property shows fine when playing the filter later on. Only the property name, which you can choose when designing the filter, doesn't appear in ParaView 4.3. If I open the same custom filter in ParaView 3.12, the name does show up.

 

Best,

Jean-Michel

Jean-Michel,

 

I am not able to reproduce what you are reporting with 4.3.1 or 4.4.

 

Did you remember to click the + sign when adding the property? The first time I tried I forgot to do that, and the Function property was not exposed in my custom filter. When I did add the property, it was exposed.

 

HTH,

Cory

Hi,

 

I am trying to create a Custom Filter in ParaView 4.3.1.

 

I am having trouble with the exposed properties of a Calculator filter: when defining the properties for my custom filter, I am selecting the "Function" property and setting the property name for this Calculator. However, when using the custom filter, this property name does not appear in the Properties panel of the Object Inspector. Is this a known bug or is there something I'm missing ?

 

Also, is it possible to hide the calculator buttons and only leave the blank field ? This was the default behavior in (at least) ParaView 3.12.0.

 

Thank you for your help.

to expose named properties that are inputs to a Programmable Filter [1].

I have tried setting that too, but it doesnt work. Perhaps its some weird combination of python, tkinter installed using macports with paraview 4.4 pre-built-binary that requires some special trick. I will try on Linux sometimes.

Hi,

I think you should *add* the Paraview
path to the environment variable. Now
you overwrite it. So the typical syntax
is (bash):

export avar=adir:$avar

(Send from my phone, so I hope the formatting is reasonable).

2. python code to run compiled python on my cluster
3. python code to run compiled python server on my cluster

I dont know yet what would the difference in 2nd and 3rd point but for now I am trying to write a python script that would start python and open a file and visualize it.

Any help would be highly appreciated.

Thanks for the suggestions.  After looking into it further the type of visualisation I am after is volume rendering of the data with an opacity transfer function based on the scalar data values.

I have set up my volume rendering to have full (i.e =1) opacity through the range of scalar values I?m interested in, reducing to near transparency either side of this.  I also want specular highlighting of the opaque tissues.

However, despite these settings Paraview does not seem to render any voxels as fully opaque and there is certainly no specular highlighting.  Is this a known limitation?

Many thanks

Matthew,

* Can you send us the exact number you are putting in for the transfer
function? Make sure that you have values for the entire range of scalar
values?

* Are you using OpenGL2 version?

All,

Pat Marion discussed adding interactive Properties for a Programmable Filter here:
http://www.kitware.com/blog/home/post/534

I have a few questions about this:

1.       Is this still valid for v4.4 with the original python_filter_generator.py?

2.      Have we added any other capability.  For instance,  I would love to present a list of variables to be calculated and let my user select or unselect each to decide exactly what he wants as output.   With a numeric field with 0 as unselect and 1 as select, people will always manage to type something else in there.    If this interface could have a checklist, or if fields could have a drop down list (Yes/No, etc) then this would greatly expand the utility of this technique.

So, is anyone using this and perhaps knows how to do these extended things?

Thanks for any hints

Dennis

Hi Shakthi,

I'm moving this over to the ParaView users mailing list because it is more
ParaView-related than VTK-related. Here's how to reproduce the video:

- Run ParaView and load your VTK file
- Click on Superman_export.gcode.vtk
- Select Filters -> Threshold. In the Scalars combo box, pick the
"build_time" variable. Click Apply.
- Open the Animation view (View -> Animation View)
- In the Animation View, look for the "Threshold1" combo box. PIck the
"Threshold Range (1)" value in the combo box to the right.
- Now click the + sign on the left side.
- In the entry named "Threshold1 - Threshold Range (1)" that is now in the
table (under the column "Time"), double-click on the icon that looks a
little bit like dumbells. In the window that pops up, set the value in the
first row to 0 and the value in the second row 23.341.... Click OK
- No change the "No. Frames:" setting to 1000.
- Play the animation by clicking the play button in the animation controls.

You should see the motion of the printer head play out in front of you. You
can save this animation to a video via the File -> Save Animation menu item.

HTH,
Cory

Aashish - thanks for the reply

I am using the latest OS X binary download (4.4.0) - is this OpenGL2?  When I switch ?Volume Rendering Mode? to GPU rendering all images disappear so I presume I?m only able to use CPU rendering.  I am on a 2014 Macbook Pro with Nvidia GT750M.

I?m using contrast enhanced volumetric CT imaging.  I want to render blood vessels in red; within the scan they appear in approximately the 100-200 Hounsfield unit range. The full range of scalar data is [-1024, 3071]. On this basis I?ve set up the following colour and opacity mappings:

Colour:
Value	R-G-B
-1024	0-0-0
99		0-0-0
100		1-0-0
200		1-0-0
201		0-0-0
3071	0-0-0

Opacity:
Value	Opacity
-1024	0
99		0
100		1
200		1
201		0
3071	0

None of the voxels appear to be fully opaque in the rendering.  When I increase the specular from 0 to 1 it has no effect at all on the image.

Ideally, I would want to emulate something along the lines of this: http://www.cemuva.com/img/uploads/malformacion-arteriovenosa-cerebral-3d.jpg <http://www.cemuva.com/img/uploads/malformacion-arteriovenosa-cerebral-3d.jpg>

Again, cheers for the help
Mathew

Qt5 needs a newer libxcb than is shipped on some of these older distros
(1.2? I'd have to double check). For example, Debian Etch'n'half (yes,
Debian 4) which we use to build the current binaries cannot build it.
And a newer libxcb needs a newer X than is availble tooi and that
certainly isn't going to be added to the superbuild :) . I would expect
RHEL5 to have similar problems (RHEL6 would be better).

Besides that, there is a known bug in Qt5 which makes user interaction
painful on X. Basically, mouse events aren't collapsed, so every mouse
event has a render call in between. It's basically unusable. There is a
patch which got merged in for 5.6.0, but that hasn't had a release yet.

Message-ID: <CAACk83o0Oyh+g0piZHenKQWToEFCgQ3KMq7MzxXHioBtyz4s7Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have been using Paraview (directly run from binary) on my Mac for 2 years
now and have used its python shell effectively to render images and save
them by using scripts.

But the current method involves on-screen rendering and I am currently
limited by the size of my simulations. (Paraview starts hanging when I try
and render over a million spheres)

I have access to a cluster (Red Hat 6) where I can use MPI. I have looked
at a lot of forums where there are discussions about offscreen rendering
using Mesa.

What I would love to do: Build paraview such that I can submit my python
scripts on the cluster as jobs and have Paraview work on my vtp files in
parallel and render images offscreen.

If this is possible, can someone guide me as to how I can do that? The
paraview wiki pages are slightly complicated for me and I am new to
building libraries using the terminal.

Thanks a lot !

Hey all,


Where might I find the development files that are installed into the install/ directory as a result of using the ENABLE_paraviewsdk=ON flag? After running cpack for a Debian package, I can't seem to find the development files in the resulting deb package.


Am I missing any other flags? I had tried using PARAVIEW_INSTALL_DEVELOPMENT_FILES but that seems to now be defunct.


Thanks,

I am also trying to do something similar. For now I tried using Python on my mac with default binary build but it doesnt work. Hence I have same question to ask the Gurus here:

1. I used CCMAKE to build paraview. CCMAKE, which is graphical/ncurses based, and in advanced mode - has hundreds of options (spread over 14 pages) that I dont remember myself which options I chose last time I built paraview myself. Hence instead of ccmake, is there another command based way to build Paraview ? Or can I run CCMAKE first time and save the config file so that I remember what option I chose while building last time ? If yes then which file is generated as a result of ccmake that I can copy and preserve and then use it again and again to rebuild with same parameters or change one or two paramteres (such as path to HDF5).

2. I need to build paraview in client and server config with python, C++, MPI and HDF5 support. Is there a simple step by step guidance on wiki on how to do it ?
I found following by the way:
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Setting_up_a_ParaView_Server
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/images/a/a1/Cluster09_PV_Tut_Setup.pdf

Are these the only setup instructions? Or are there more pages / links somewhere.

Thanks and Regards

Amit

Hi,

I have been using Paraview (directly run from binary) on my Mac for 2 years now and have used its python shell effectively to render images and save them by using scripts.

But the current method involves on-screen rendering and I am currently limited by the size of my simulations. (Paraview starts hanging when I try and render over a million spheres)

I have access to a cluster (Red Hat 6) where I can use MPI. I have looked at a lot of forums where there are discussions about offscreen rendering using Mesa.

What I would love to do: Build paraview such that I can submit my python scripts on the cluster as jobs and have Paraview work on my vtp files in parallel and render images offscreen.

If this is possible, can someone guide me as to how I can do that? The paraview wiki pages are slightly complicated for me and I am new to building libraries using the terminal.

Thanks a lot !

If you can point me to any relevant documentation on on how to go

the same.

Thanks for your prompt replies.

Appreciate it!

Hi Shakthi,

I'm moving this over to the ParaView users mailing list because it is
more ParaView-related than VTK-related. Here's how to reproduce the
video:

- Run ParaView and load your VTK file
- Click on Superman_export.gcode.vtk
- Select Filters -> Threshold. In the Scalars combo box, pick the
"build_time" variable. Click Apply.
- Open the Animation view (View -> Animation View)
- In the Animation View, look for the "Threshold1" combo box. PIck the
"Threshold Range (1)" value in the combo box to the right.
- Now click the + sign on the left side.
- In the entry named "Threshold1 - Threshold Range (1)" that is now in
the table (under the column "Time"), double-click on the icon that
looks a little bit like dumbells. In the window that pops up, set the
value in the first row to 0 and the value in the second row 23.341....
Click OK
- No change the "No. Frames:" setting to 1000.
- Play the animation by clicking the play button in the animation controls.

You should see the motion of the printer head play out in front of
you. You can save this animation to a video via the File -> Save
Animation menu item.

HTH,
Cory

Issue 1: Loading ASCII stl file
When I try to load my ASCII stl file on the ParaviewWeb, I receive the following error message in my log file. However, desktop ParaView application loads the file fine.?

I checked HTTP traffic, it has the following message. I assume the connection is closed because of the above error.?

Issue 3: Slow ParaViewWeb
My ParaViewWeb is very slow. Even I change the rendering mode to WebGL, It is still very slow. The Ubuntu 14.04 Sever ?specifications are the following:
- 8 Cores?- 8 GB RAM??- 2.3 Ghz processors


Please let me know if I have setup anything incorrectly. Could anybody help me with the above three issues that I am experiencing now. Thank you very much!

Kai L.

You can do this if you have a fixed number of variables. Just list each
variable option as a IntVectorProperty with a BooleanDomain in the XML. In
the input file for the filter generator, just express these options with
the default values, .e.g,

Properties = dict(

  generate_var1 = True,

  generate_var2 = False,

  generate_var3 = False

  )


The filter generator will convert each of these lines into XML of the
following form:

      <IntVectorProperty
        name="generate_var1"
        label="generate var1"
        initial_string="generate_var1"
        command="SetParameter"
        animateable="1"
        default_values="1"
        number_of_elements="1">
        <BooleanDomain name="bool" />
        <Documentation></Documentation>
      </IntVectorProperty>


These properties will appear as checkboxes in the UI of your filter.

Of course, you can tweak the XML files that are generated if it doesn't get
the label attribute for the property right, for instance.

I hope that helps.

Subject: [Paraview] X Error: BadWindow
Message-ID: <CACoCd8d3BQC8J+D=iRW9snLvwZXFO2KXWf8saE6fBYJPmfm6fg@mail.gmail.com>

Hey all, I have a quick question. This has been annoying me for some time.
I like to have as much screen real estate as possible for my
post-processing so I like to detach the Pipeline Browser, Properties,
Information, etc. windows and move them across to another monitor.

Ever since I've started doing this I get the following errors whenever I
start up Paraview (including4.4):

X Error: BadWindow (invalid Window parameter) 3

Major opcode: 20 (X_GetProperty)

Resource id: 0x2004047

X Error: BadWindow (invalid Window parameter) 3

Major opcode: 15 (X_QueryTree)

Resource id: 0x2004047

X Error: BadWindow (invalid Window parameter) 3

Major opcode: 40 (X_TranslateCoords)

Resource id: 0x2004048

X Error: BadWindow (invalid Window parameter) 3

Major opcode: 20 (X_GetProperty)

Resource id: 0x2004066

X Error: BadWindow (invalid Window parameter) 3

Major opcode: 15 (X_QueryTree)

Resource id: 0x2004066

X Error: BadWindow (invalid Window parameter) 3

Major opcode: 40 (X_TranslateCoords)

Resource id: 0x2004066



However, if I just close the message window and ignore them I am able to
carry on normally. Is this the expected behavior? If it is, that's ok, I'll
just carry on. But if it isn't I though someone might know how to fix it.


Thanks for your time,

Attached is the solution, there a small mistake in my origin script:

 vtkClientServerStream stream;
 stream << vtkClientServerStream::Invoke
              << VTKOBJECT(proxy)
               << SetValues

Cory,

Wow, that?s exactly what I need ? now I just need to get some time to re-implement my filters using this!

Thanks again

I have a few questions about this:

1.       Is this still valid for v4.4 with the original python_filter_generator.py?
Yes, I just tested it.

2.      Have we added any other capability.  For instance,  I would love to present a list of variables to be calculated and let my user select or unselect each to decide exactly what he wants as output.   With a numeric field with 0 as unselect and 1 as select, people will always manage to type something else in there.    If this interface could have a checklist, or if fields could have a drop down list (Yes/No, etc) then this would greatly expand the utility of this technique.
You can do this if you have a fixed number of variables. Just list each variable option as a IntVectorProperty with a BooleanDomain in the XML. In the input file for the filter generator, just express these options with the default values, .e.g,


Properties = dict(

  generate_var1 = True,

  generate_var2 = False,

  generate_var3 = False

  )

The filter generator will convert each of these lines into XML of the following form:

      <IntVectorProperty
        name="generate_var1"
        label="generate var1"
        initial_string="generate_var1"
        command="SetParameter"
        animateable="1"
        default_values="1"
        number_of_elements="1">
        <BooleanDomain name="bool" />
        <Documentation></Documentation>
      </IntVectorProperty>


These properties will appear as checkboxes in the UI of your filter.

Of course, you can tweak the XML files that are generated if it doesn't get the label attribute for the property right, for instance.

I hope that helps.
Cory


So, is anyone using this and perhaps knows how to do these extended things?

Thanks for any hints

Dennis

Did you build the ParaView desktop application in the same build as the
version you're using to run ParaViewWeb?  Maybe you could try to take one
of the standard ParaView datasets and try to load it in ParaViewWeb, and
see if you have the same issue you mentioned above.  To get this data if
you don't already have it, go here:

http://www.paraview.org/download/

And under "Type of Download", choose "Data, Documentation, and Tutorials".
Once you get this data, try opening the "disk_out_ref.ex2" file in
ParaViewWeb.  If you see the same issue as above, then there could be
something going on with the way you have built ParaView, which we can try
to figure out at that point.  If you do not see the same issue as above,
then perhaps you could send me (off the list) a sample data file I could
use to try to replicate the problem and debug it on this end.

I wonder if the server side process crashed as a result of the error you
see in the log file?  That would explain the websocket connection error.
Again, trying a known data set like "disk_out_ref.ex2" may help us to
pinpoint problem which caused the error output you saw above.

To get faster rendering with OSMesa, you may try building a recent version
of OSMesa using Gallium + LLVMPipe.  See here:

http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/ParaView_And_Mesa_3D

But even that won't be as fast as hardware rendering (not using OSMesa).
I'm not sure why you don't see a speedup when switching to WebGL, though,
for if your data is small enough to all fit in within the GPU of your
desktop or laptop, then it should be faster than offscreen rendering on the
server, once the data is loaded.

Just glancing through the configuration files you provided, I don't see
anything wrong.

Hope this helps,
Scott

One more question ? the original article says that

Alternatively, the Script properties can be hidden completely from the properties panel.

How is this accomplished?

Dennis,

Great! I'm glad it's what you are looking for.

You can hide any property by editing the XML file. In the property element,
add an attribute called "panel_visibility" and set this to "never". This
will hide the property from view. You can also set it to "advanced" so that
it shows up only when the advanced option is enabled.

Here's an example:

      <StringVectorProperty
        panel_visibility="never"
        name="Script"
        command="SetScript"
        number_of_elements="1"
        default_values="my python script">
      <Documentation>This property contains the text of a python program
that
      the programmable source runs.</Documentation>
      </StringVectorProperty>

Cheers,
Cory

Hi Cory,

I would like to render lines using a Python callback method, and I am
assuming Paraview does the same as well. I am using the following code
snippet as a template:

 http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK/Examples/Python/GeometricObjects/Display/LongLine

and the following examples for a callback function:

  http://cmake.org/Wiki/VTK/Examples/Python/Animation

  http://public.kitware.com/pipermail/vtkusers/2010-January/056316.html

Changing the colour of the line using the callback method after 5s
works fine. But, I am not sure how to add more points and lines to the
existing image. My hacked up code is here:

  https://gist.github.com/shakthimaan/588af4b6d0facdf2cc89

How do I incrementally add lines to an existing drawing, and render them?

Appreciate any help in this regard,

Thanks!

SK

Cory,

I?m pretending to be a real programmer, so my Programmable Filter script looks something like this:

Def sub1:
   Do some stuff
   Return var

Def sub2(var):
   Do some stuff
   Return newVar

Def sub3(var):
   Do some stuff
   Return newVar

Def RequestData():
       X=sub1()
       Y=sub2(X)
       Z=sub3(Y)
      Do something with Z

Everything except RequestData gets lost ? should I just manually break everything down and insert at the beginning of the default_values in StringVectorProperty, or is there some way to trick it into reading the entire script?

Thanks

Dennis

Dennis,

Great! I'm glad it's what you are looking for.

You can hide any property by editing the XML file. In the property element, add an attribute called "panel_visibility" and set this to "never". This will hide the property from view. You can also set it to "advanced" so that it shows up only when the advanced option is enabled.

Here's an example:

      <StringVectorProperty
        panel_visibility="never"
        name="Script"
        command="SetScript"
        number_of_elements="1"
        default_values="my python script">
      <Documentation>This property contains the text of a python program that
      the programmable source runs.</Documentation>
      </StringVectorProperty>

Cheers,
Cory

Alternatively, the Script properties can be hidden completely from the properties panel.

How is this accomplished?

All,

Pat Marion discussed adding interactive Properties for a Programmable Filter here:
http://www.kitware.com/blog/home/post/534

I have a few questions about this:

1.       Is this still valid for v4.4 with the original python_filter_generator.py?
Yes, I just tested it.

2.      Have we added any other capability.  For instance,  I would love to present a list of variables to be calculated and let my user select or unselect each to decide exactly what he wants as output.   With a numeric field with 0 as unselect and 1 as select, people will always manage to type something else in there.    If this interface could have a checklist, or if fields could have a drop down list (Yes/No, etc) then this would greatly expand the utility of this technique.
You can do this if you have a fixed number of variables. Just list each variable option as a IntVectorProperty with a BooleanDomain in the XML. In the input file for the filter generator, just express these options with the default values, .e.g,


Properties = dict(

  generate_var1 = True,

  generate_var2 = False,

  generate_var3 = False

  )

The filter generator will convert each of these lines into XML of the following form:

      <IntVectorProperty
        name="generate_var1"
        label="generate var1"
        initial_string="generate_var1"
        command="SetParameter"
        animateable="1"
        default_values="1"
        number_of_elements="1">
        <BooleanDomain name="bool" />
        <Documentation></Documentation>
      </IntVectorProperty>


These properties will appear as checkboxes in the UI of your filter.

Of course, you can tweak the XML files that are generated if it doesn't get the label attribute for the property right, for instance.

I hope that helps.
Cory


So, is anyone using this and perhaps knows how to do these extended things?

Thanks for any hints

Dennis

Hi Dennis,

The converter evaluates your Python script and then uses some Python
reflection features to extract the code in your RequestData function. But
it does this only for the RequestData function (as well as a
RequestInformation and RequestUpdateExtent functions, but these aren't
always needed). The converter is simply ignoring your other functions.

To get around this, try defining your sub* functions as inner functions in
RequestData(), e.g.,

Def RequestData():

   Def sub1:

      Do some stuff

      Return var



   Def sub2(var):

      Do some stuff

      Return newVar



   Def sub3(var):

      Do some stuff

      Return newVar


   X=sub1()

   Y=sub2(X)

   Z=sub3(Y)

   Do something with Z


Best regards,
Cory

Cory,

I had just thought of this and tried it (successfully) about when your note came in.

I hate to quibble, but I would suggest that in the typeMap in the python_filter_generator.py vtkMultiBlockDataSet is listed as vtkMultiblockDataSet and I had to figure this out and use a small ?b? before it would work ? so if you are going to publish this routine anywhere, you might want to edit that!

Thanks again ? as soon as I figure out why it is grayed out on the Filter list I am going to test this thing out.

Hi Dennis,

The converter evaluates your Python script and then uses some Python reflection features to extract the code in your RequestData function. But it does this only for the RequestData function (as well as a RequestInformation and RequestUpdateExtent functions, but these aren't always needed). The converter is simply ignoring your other functions.

To get around this, try defining your sub* functions as inner functions in RequestData(), e.g.,

Def RequestData():
   Def sub1:
      Do some stuff
      Return var

   Def sub2(var):
      Do some stuff
      Return newVar

   Def sub3(var):
      Do some stuff
      Return newVar

   X=sub1()
   Y=sub2(X)
   Z=sub3(Y)
   Do something with Z

Best regards,
Cory

Dennis,

Great! I'm glad it's what you are looking for.

You can hide any property by editing the XML file. In the property element, add an attribute called "panel_visibility" and set this to "never". This will hide the property from view. You can also set it to "advanced" so that it shows up only when the advanced option is enabled.

Here's an example:

      <StringVectorProperty
        panel_visibility="never"
        name="Script"
        command="SetScript"
        number_of_elements="1"
        default_values="my python script">
      <Documentation>This property contains the text of a python program that
      the programmable source runs.</Documentation>
      </StringVectorProperty>

Cheers,
Cory

All,

Pat Marion discussed adding interactive Properties for a Programmable Filter here:
http://www.kitware.com/blog/home/post/534

I have a few questions about this:

1.       Is this still valid for v4.4 with the original python_filter_generator.py?
Yes, I just tested it.

2.      Have we added any other capability.  For instance,  I would love to present a list of variables to be calculated and let my user select or unselect each to decide exactly what he wants as output.   With a numeric field with 0 as unselect and 1 as select, people will always manage to type something else in there.    If this interface could have a checklist, or if fields could have a drop down list (Yes/No, etc) then this would greatly expand the utility of this technique.
You can do this if you have a fixed number of variables. Just list each variable option as a IntVectorProperty with a BooleanDomain in the XML. In the input file for the filter generator, just express these options with the default values, .e.g,


Properties = dict(

  generate_var1 = True,

  generate_var2 = False,

  generate_var3 = False

  )

The filter generator will convert each of these lines into XML of the following form:

      <IntVectorProperty
        name="generate_var1"
        label="generate var1"
        initial_string="generate_var1"
        command="SetParameter"
        animateable="1"
        default_values="1"
        number_of_elements="1">
        <BooleanDomain name="bool" />
        <Documentation></Documentation>
      </IntVectorProperty>


These properties will appear as checkboxes in the UI of your filter.

Of course, you can tweak the XML files that are generated if it doesn't get the label attribute for the property right, for instance.

I hope that helps.
Cory


So, is anyone using this and perhaps knows how to do these extended things?

Thanks for any hints

Dennis

I am using state files as a solution for now, while i can't find a way of
saving solid color info.

The problem is that each filter that I apply in my data, I have to color
the data again.

It is a large group of data so it's counter-productive.

Maybe, when there's time, I will produce a scalar with the same value for
all the points, and link with a custom color palette, I think it will help
me better than state files.

Thanks anyway Cory!

You can cut all almost everything out of that, put it into a build
directory, and ccmake or (just cmake if it is a consistent set) and it will
do the right thing.

You can also use command line arguments:
(c)cmake -DSOME_CMAKE_VARIABLE:TYPE=VALUE .

To do the same thing.

I'm not sure if I understand exactly what you mean. Statefiles are meant to
be the way to save display properties.

Ah ha! It turns out that there is an option in ParaView 4.3 (maybe a
version or two earlier as well) that lets you specify that the properties
applied to one pipeline item get applied to the output of a filter applied
to that item. Go to Edit -> Settings and type "inherit" in the search box
at the top. Check the checkbox next to the "Inherit Representation
Properties" setting.

A color map won't be saved when you save the data, so I don't think this
approach will help you.

All,

So, I can load the xml plugin but the filter is grayed out on the Filters menu.   I have tried removing the InputDataSetType so that it should accept any type of input, but still gray.   I am not sure how Paraview decides which filters are inappropriate (greyed-out) so I don?t have many ideas on how to overcome this.

I loaded the  TestFilter.xml from the blog and that is also greyed-out.    I loaded the DoubleHelixSource.xml and that is available in the Sources menu and runs.

Thanks

Dennis

If this interface could have a checklist, or if fields could have a drop down list (Yes/No, etc) then this would greatly expand the utility of this technique.
You can do this if you have a fixed number of variables. Just list each variable option as a IntVectorProperty with a BooleanDomain in the XML. In the input file for the filter generator, just express these options with the default values, .e.g,


Properties = dict(

  generate_var1 = True,

  generate_var2 = False,

  generate_var3 = False

  )

The filter generator will convert each of these lines into XML of the following form:

      <IntVectorProperty
        name="generate_var1"
        label="generate var1"
        initial_string="generate_var1"
        command="SetParameter"
        animateable="1"
        default_values="1"
        number_of_elements="1">
        <BooleanDomain name="bool" />
        <Documentation></Documentation>
      </IntVectorProperty>


These properties will appear as checkboxes in the UI of your filter.

Of course, you can tweak the XML files that are generated if it doesn't get the label attribute for the property right, for instance.

I hope that helps.
Cory


So, is anyone using this and perhaps knows how to do these extended things?

Thanks for any hints

Dennis

Hi Dennis,

What is your input to the Test Filter? I can apply it to a Sphere source
input.

For your custom filter, the XML file should contain the following:

      <InputProperty
        name="Input"
        command="SetInputConnection">
          <ProxyGroupDomain name="groups">
            <Group name="sources"/>
            <Group name="filters"/>
          </ProxyGroupDomain>

          <DataTypeDomain name="input_type">
            <DataType value="vtkMultiBlockDataSet"/>
          </DataTypeDomain>
      </InputProperty>

This tells ParaView to enable your filter when a multi-block data set is
selected in the Pipeline browser. If it doesn't have this, then I believe
the filter is not enabled for any input.

Hope that helps,
Cory

Cory,

I applied to bake.e, which is a vtkMultiblockDataSet (I believe!).

I tried both ?B? and ?b? without success.

I just now changed the input_type to vtkDataSet, which I guessed was more general and now it works.   I have no idea why vtkMultiblockDataSet didn?t work, but I have a workaround.

Thanks again for slogging thru this with me.

Hi Dennis,

What is your input to the Test Filter? I can apply it to a Sphere source input.

For your custom filter, the XML file should contain the following:

      <InputProperty
        name="Input"
        command="SetInputConnection">
          <ProxyGroupDomain name="groups">
            <Group name="sources"/>
            <Group name="filters"/>
          </ProxyGroupDomain>

          <DataTypeDomain name="input_type">
            <DataType value="vtkMultiBlockDataSet"/>
          </DataTypeDomain>
      </InputProperty>

This tells ParaView to enable your filter when a multi-block data set is selected in the Pipeline browser. If it doesn't have this, then I believe the filter is not enabled for any input.

Hope that helps,
Cory

So, I can load the xml plugin but the filter is grayed out on the Filters menu.   I have tried removing the InputDataSetType so that it should accept any type of input, but still gray.   I am not sure how Paraview decides which filters are inappropriate (greyed-out) so I don?t have many ideas on how to overcome this.

I loaded the  TestFilter.xml from the blog and that is also greyed-out.    I loaded the DoubleHelixSource.xml and that is available in the Sources menu and runs.

Cory,

I had just thought of this and tried it (successfully) about when your note came in.

I hate to quibble, but I would suggest that in the typeMap in the python_filter_generator.py vtkMultiBlockDataSet is listed as vtkMultiblockDataSet and I had to figure this out and use a small ?b? before it would work ? so if you are going to publish this routine anywhere, you might want to edit that!

Thanks again ? as soon as I figure out why it is grayed out on the Filter list I am going to test this thing out.

Hi Dennis,

The converter evaluates your Python script and then uses some Python reflection features to extract the code in your RequestData function. But it does this only for the RequestData function (as well as a RequestInformation and RequestUpdateExtent functions, but these aren't always needed). The converter is simply ignoring your other functions.

To get around this, try defining your sub* functions as inner functions in RequestData(), e.g.,

Def RequestData():
   Def sub1:
      Do some stuff
      Return var

   Def sub2(var):
      Do some stuff
      Return newVar

   Def sub3(var):
      Do some stuff
      Return newVar

   X=sub1()
   Y=sub2(X)
   Z=sub3(Y)
   Do something with Z

Best regards,
Cory

Dennis,

Great! I'm glad it's what you are looking for.

You can hide any property by editing the XML file. In the property element, add an attribute called "panel_visibility" and set this to "never". This will hide the property from view. You can also set it to "advanced" so that it shows up only when the advanced option is enabled.

Here's an example:

      <StringVectorProperty
        panel_visibility="never"
        name="Script"
        command="SetScript"
        number_of_elements="1"
        default_values="my python script">
      <Documentation>This property contains the text of a python program that
      the programmable source runs.</Documentation>
      </StringVectorProperty>

Cheers,
Cory

Cory,

Wow, that?s exactly what I need ? now I just need to get some time to re-implement my filters using this!

Thanks again

Dennis

Hi Dennis,

All,

Pat Marion discussed adding interactive Properties for a Programmable Filter here:
http://www.kitware.com/blog/home/post/534

I have a few questions about this:

1.       Is this still valid for v4.4 with the original python_filter_generator.py?
Yes, I just tested it.

2.      Have we added any other capability.  For instance,  I would love to present a list of variables to be calculated and let my user select or unselect each to decide exactly what he wants as output.   With a numeric field with 0 as unselect and 1 as select, people will always manage to type something else in there.    If this interface could have a checklist, or if fields could have a drop down list (Yes/No, etc) then this would greatly expand the utility of this technique.
You can do this if you have a fixed number of variables. Just list each variable option as a IntVectorProperty with a BooleanDomain in the XML. In the input file for the filter generator, just express these options with the default values, .e.g,


Properties = dict(

  generate_var1 = True,

  generate_var2 = False,

  generate_var3 = False

  )

The filter generator will convert each of these lines into XML of the following form:

      <IntVectorProperty
        name="generate_var1"
        label="generate var1"
        initial_string="generate_var1"
        command="SetParameter"
        animateable="1"
        default_values="1"
        number_of_elements="1">
        <BooleanDomain name="bool" />
        <Documentation></Documentation>
      </IntVectorProperty>


These properties will appear as checkboxes in the UI of your filter.

Of course, you can tweak the XML files that are generated if it doesn't get the label attribute for the property right, for instance.

I hope that helps.
Cory


So, is anyone using this and perhaps knows how to do these extended things?

Thanks for any hints

Dennis

No it would be OpenGL old version VTK. It would be nice if you can try
OpenGL2 version although I don't think your problem is related to GL

This is a useful dataset:

http://eis.bris.ac.uk/~mexas/0.txz

It's a raw binary with extents 152, 152, 150.
I read it as int, littleEndian.

Many thanks

Subject: [Paraview] LIMIT STREAMLINES IN STREAM TRACER WITH CUSTOM SOURCE
	FILTER
Message-ID: <CADvG_ev4iyQ1f_ZfJFEimNg6x4W5ioBPOJWUbOfjuma1pVcXpg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I would like to know if there is a way to limit the number of
streamlines generated when using the Stream Tracer with custom source
filter. By default, it generates a streamline for each cell in the
chosen seed source. This is often not so convenient, because the
resulted streanlines are to much.

Is there a way to limit the number of streamlines generating them
every nth points for example, or giving an uniform spatial
distribution?

Thanks,

Gaspare

Hello, Gaspare.
> is there a way to limit the number of streamlines
Yes, it's simple. You should use "Mask Points" filter. It will work also if
you start streamlines from the slice (for example, inlet). The pipeline is
Source (Slice or something else) => Mask Points => Streamlines. I used this
simple method for the streamlines started from inlet.

Dear Scott,
Thanks for your quick response, I have also put my?responses inline below with light blue color :





Issue 1:?Loading ASCII stl file
When I try to load my ASCII stl file on the ParaviewWeb, I receive the following error message in my log file. However, desktop ParaView application loads the file fine.?
ERROR: In /home/user/ParaViewWeb/ParaView/src/VTK/IO/Geometry/vtkSTLReader.cxx, line 461vtkSTLReader (0x5d89b50): STLReader: error while reading file /home/user/ParaViewWeb/data/Mitchell_Lee_Administration_ReckordArmory_.stl at line 14: unable to read reading point.

Debug: Off? Modified Time: 225417? Reference Count: 1? Registered Events: (none)? Request: REQUEST_DATA? FROM_OUTPUT_PORT: 0? ALGORITHM_AFTER_FORWARD: 1? FORWARD_DIRECTION: 0


Did you build the ParaView desktop application in the same build as the version you're using to run ParaViewWeb?? Maybe you could try to take one of the standard ParaView datasets and try to load it in ParaViewWeb, and see if you have the same issue you mentioned above.? To get this data if you don't already have it, go here:
http://www.paraview.org/download/

And under "Type of Download", choose "Data, Documentation, and Tutorials".? Once you get this data, try opening the "disk_out_ref.ex2" file in ParaViewWeb.? If you see the same issue as above, then there could be something going on with the way you have built ParaView, which we can try to figure out at that point.? If you do not see the same issue as above, then perhaps you could send me (off the list) a sample data file I could use to try to replicate the problem and debug it on this end.

Kai's Response?
I did not build the ParaView desktop application. I installed ParaView 4.1.0 through the Ubuntu terminal using ?sudo?apt-get?install?paraviewopenfoam410?.?
I tested files with?local?ParaView desktop application as well as local ParaViewWeb. My Ubuntu 14.04 server does not have ParaView application, and it has only ParaViewWeb. Both server and local ParaViewWeb produce the same issues.?
I have tested?"disk_out_ref.ex2" file in ParaViewWeb, and it seems to be okay. I will send you the sample data files privately.?

Issue 2:?
If I do the following selections on the ParaViewWeb, I always receive?src/VTK/Common/Core/vtkDataArrayTemplate.h:191: T vtkDataArrayTemplate<T>::GetValue(vtkIdType) [with T = float; vtkIdType = long long int]: Assertion `id >= 0 && id < this->Size' failed?message in the log file and cause the web socket connection closed. ?

I checked HTTP traffic, it has the following message. I assume the connection is closed because of the above error.?



I wonder if the server side process crashed as a result of the error you see in the log file?? That would explain the websocket connection error.? Again, trying a known data set like "disk_out_ref.ex2" may help us to pinpoint problem which caused the error output you saw above.

Kai's Response?
My?unintelligent question is how could I determine if the server side process crashed??

Issue 3: Slow ParaViewWeb
My ParaViewWeb is very slow. Even I change the rendering mode to WebGL, It is still very slow. The Ubuntu 14.04 Sever ?specifications are the following:
- 8 Cores?- 8 GB RAM??- 2.3 Ghz processors



To get faster rendering with OSMesa, you may try building a recent version of OSMesa using Gallium + LLVMPipe.? See here:
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/ParaView_And_Mesa_3D

But even that won't be as fast as hardware rendering (not using OSMesa).? I'm not sure why you don't see a speedup when switching to WebGL, though, for if your data is small enough to all fit in within the GPU of your desktop or laptop, then it should be faster than offscreen rendering on the server, once the data is loaded.
Kai's Response?

I believe my build?is based on??recent version of OSMesa using Gallium + LLVMPipe
Mesa 9.2.2 OSMesa Gallium llvmpipe

make -j4
autoreconf -fi
./configure \CXXFLAGS="-O2 -g -DDEFAULT_SOFTWARE_DEPTH_BITS=31" \CFLAGS="-O2 -g -DDEFAULT_SOFTWARE_DEPTH_BITS=31" \--disable-xvmc \--disable-glx \--disable-dri \--with-dri-drivers="" \--with-gallium-drivers="swrast" \--enable-texture-float \--disable-shared-glapi \--disable-egl \--with-egl-platforms="" \--enable-gallium-osmesa \--enable-gallium-llvm=yes \--with-llvm-shared-libs \--prefix=/opt/mesa/9.2.2/llvmpipe

make -j2
make -j4 install

When I built ParaViewWeb, The following is what I changed when I generated the cmake file:
PARAVIEW_ENABLE_PYTHON ?????ONPARAVIEW_BUILD_QT_GUI ??????OFFCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX ???????/.../ParaView/installVTK_USE_X ??????????????????OFFOPENGL_INCLUDE_DIR ?????????/opt/mesa/9.2.2/llvmpipe/includeOPENGL_gl_LIBRARYOPENGL_glu_LIBRARY ?????????/opt/mesa/9.2.2/llvmpipe/lib/libGLU.soVTK_OPENGL_HAS_OSMESA ??????ONOSMESA_INCLUDE_DIR ?????????/opt/mesa/9.2.2/llvmpipe/includeOSMESA_LIBRARY ?????????????/opt/mesa/9.2.2/llvmpipe/lib/libOSMesa.so


Please feel free to correct me if you believe you did not build a recent version of OSMesa using Gallium + LLVMPipe

I will send you two data files. First one is an ASCII STL file (issue 1) and second one is the issue rendering output fields (issue 2). Thank you for your help!
Please let me know if you need anything from me.?

I'm not sure why you don't see a speedup when switching to WebGL, though, for if your data is small enough to all fit in within the GPU of your desktop or laptop, then it should be faster than offscreen rendering on the server, once the data is loaded.
Just glancing through the configuration files you provided, I don't see anything wrong.
Hope this helps,Scott
?

Please let me know if I have setup anything incorrectly. Could anybody help me with the above three issues that I am experiencing now. Thank you very much!

Kai L.

Subject: [Paraview] ParaViewWeb - Issues with Loading ASCII STL file &
 Rendering the Output Fields

Hello Kai,

   Regarding the data files you shared, I did some testing and found some
things out:

1) Regarding using local rendering on the cube data file: It seems that
with local rendering, we may not properly handle coloring by arrays where
the data range is 0 (e.g. the range of T in your case was [303.1499938964844,
303.1499938964844]).  I was able to use local rendering by first loading
the data, then choosing a local rendering approach (either worked fine),
and then going back and coloring by T.  This could be a workaround if you
need to test the speed of local rendering vs remote.

2) Regarding loading the .stl file, I did not run into the same issue as
you did, i.e. the .stl file loaded without any problems.  The paraviewweb I
am running was built from master which is a day or so old, so I'm wondering
what version you may have compiled?

The rest of my responses are inline below...

Just so I am clear.  Your "local" version is the one you install via
apt-get?  And the Ubuntu 14.04 server version is the one you built
yourself?  Did you download a source bundle to build the server one?  If
so, do you know what version you downloaded and built on your server?

One approach: Use a terminal on the machine where ParaViewWeb is running
and type:

ps -ef | grep pvpython

If the process is running, you should see a pvpython instance running,
where your pv_web_visualizer.py script is the argument, along with any
other arguments your launcher provided when it started the process for
you.  Something like:

/path/to/paraview/build/bin/pvpython
/path/to/paraview/build/lib/site-packages/paraview/web/pv_web_visualizer.py
--port 9999 --data-dir /blah/blah/blah

In the case of the cube you shared with me, the process did indeed crash as
a result of the steps you provided.

This looks fine to me, though I believe OSMesa Gallium llvmpipe has moved
along quite a few versions since that documentation was written, so
building a more recent one could be something to try.

One other thing that could be useful for us to know is what kind of network
is between your browser and the server.  When local rendering is enabled,
the server's camera is still synchronized with with camera in the browser
so that if you switch back to image delivery, you won't see some unexpected
camera angle.  If the network is *really* slow, this could perhaps keep the
local rendering from being as fast as possible.  But it seems like it would
have to be really slow.

Hope this helps.

Scott

All,

Just as FYI, to close this up:


1.      For vtkMultiblockDataSet ? set input and output both to this in .py file, then edited resulting xml file to make input vtkDataSet ? otherwise Paraview never recogonized it as a valid filter for a vtkMultiblockDataSet

2.      Parameters will be arranged in alphabetical order in the xml file ? just rearrange them into whatever order you want.

3.      Can hide script as shown in Cory?s note below

4.      Can add icon and new Filter group as shown here: http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Plugin_HowTo, which I found partway thru this discussion

Attached is a picture of the finished product

Cory,

I applied to bake.e, which is a vtkMultiblockDataSet (I believe!).

Yes. You can confirm in the Information tab next to the Properties tab.

I tried both ?B? and ?b? without success.

It should indeed be capital B.

I just now changed the input_type to vtkDataSet, which I guessed was more general and now it works.   I have no idea why vtkMultiblockDataSet didn?t work, but I have a workaround.

Hmm, I'm not sure why that would be.

Thanks again for slogging thru this with me.

No problem!

Hi Dennis,

What is your input to the Test Filter? I can apply it to a Sphere source input.

For your custom filter, the XML file should contain the following:

      <InputProperty
        name="Input"
        command="SetInputConnection">
          <ProxyGroupDomain name="groups">
            <Group name="sources"/>
            <Group name="filters"/>
          </ProxyGroupDomain>

          <DataTypeDomain name="input_type">
            <DataType value="vtkMultiBlockDataSet"/>
          </DataTypeDomain>
      </InputProperty>

This tells ParaView to enable your filter when a multi-block data set is selected in the Pipeline browser. If it doesn't have this, then I believe the filter is not enabled for any input.

Hope that helps,
Cory

All,

So, I can load the xml plugin but the filter is grayed out on the Filters menu.   I have tried removing the InputDataSetType so that it should accept any type of input, but still gray.   I am not sure how Paraview decides which filters are inappropriate (greyed-out) so I don?t have many ideas on how to overcome this.

I loaded the  TestFilter.xml from the blog and that is also greyed-out.    I loaded the DoubleHelixSource.xml and that is available in the Sources menu and runs.

Thanks

Cory,

I had just thought of this and tried it (successfully) about when your note came in.

I hate to quibble, but I would suggest that in the typeMap in the python_filter_generator.py vtkMultiBlockDataSet is listed as vtkMultiblockDataSet and I had to figure this out and use a small ?b? before it would work ? so if you are going to publish this routine anywhere, you might want to edit that!

Thanks again ? as soon as I figure out why it is grayed out on the Filter list I am going to test this thing out.

Hi Dennis,

The converter evaluates your Python script and then uses some Python reflection features to extract the code in your RequestData function. But it does this only for the RequestData function (as well as a RequestInformation and RequestUpdateExtent functions, but these aren't always needed). The converter is simply ignoring your other functions.

To get around this, try defining your sub* functions as inner functions in RequestData(), e.g.,

Def RequestData():
   Def sub1:
      Do some stuff
      Return var

   Def sub2(var):
      Do some stuff
      Return newVar

   Def sub3(var):
      Do some stuff
      Return newVar

   X=sub1()
   Y=sub2(X)
   Z=sub3(Y)
   Do something with Z

Best regards,
Cory

Dennis,

Great! I'm glad it's what you are looking for.

You can hide any property by editing the XML file. In the property element, add an attribute called "panel_visibility" and set this to "never". This will hide the property from view. You can also set it to "advanced" so that it shows up only when the advanced option is enabled.

Here's an example:

      <StringVectorProperty
        panel_visibility="never"
        name="Script"
        command="SetScript"
        number_of_elements="1"
        default_values="my python script">
      <Documentation>This property contains the text of a python program that
      the programmable source runs.</Documentation>
      </StringVectorProperty>

Cheers,
Cory

All,

Pat Marion discussed adding interactive Properties for a Programmable Filter here:
http://www.kitware.com/blog/home/post/534

I have a few questions about this:

1.       Is this still valid for v4.4 with the original python_filter_generator.py?
Yes, I just tested it.

2.      Have we added any other capability.  For instance,  I would love to present a list of variables to be calculated and let my user select or unselect each to decide exactly what he wants as output.   With a numeric field with 0 as unselect and 1 as select, people will always manage to type something else in there.    If this interface could have a checklist, or if fields could have a drop down list (Yes/No, etc) then this would greatly expand the utility of this technique.
You can do this if you have a fixed number of variables. Just list each variable option as a IntVectorProperty with a BooleanDomain in the XML. In the input file for the filter generator, just express these options with the default values, .e.g,


Properties = dict(

  generate_var1 = True,

  generate_var2 = False,

  generate_var3 = False

  )

The filter generator will convert each of these lines into XML of the following form:

      <IntVectorProperty
        name="generate_var1"
        label="generate var1"
        initial_string="generate_var1"
        command="SetParameter"
        animateable="1"
        default_values="1"
        number_of_elements="1">
        <BooleanDomain name="bool" />
        <Documentation></Documentation>
      </IntVectorProperty>


These properties will appear as checkboxes in the UI of your filter.

Of course, you can tweak the XML files that are generated if it doesn't get the label attribute for the property right, for instance.

I hope that helps.
Cory


So, is anyone using this and perhaps knows how to do these extended things?

Thanks for any hints

Dennis

 Rendering the Output Fields

Dear Scott:
Thank you for the testings.
?1) Regarding using local rendering on the cube data file: It seems that with local rendering, we may not properly handle coloring by arrays where the data range is 0 (e.g. the range of T in your case was?[303.1499938964844, 303.1499938964844]).? I was able to use local rendering by first loading the data, then choosing a local rendering approach (either worked fine), and then going back and coloring by T.? This could be a workaround if you need to test the speed of local rendering vs remote.

Kai's Response:
My?local deprecated (WebGL) rendering seems quite fast now when I load ParaView Datasets.?
I was not able to use local rendering (Local VGL or Local Deprecated) on my cube data file. I first loaded the data, chose local (Deprecated) option and then went back to color by T. I got the same error message: WebSocket connection to 'ws://XXXX:8080/proxy?sessionId=7bb6e67a-63a9-11e5-9b44-00155dd73e0d' failed: Error during WebSocket handshake: Unexpected response code: 503 . I believe the server side process indeed crashed. However, remote rendering does seem to work fine with T color. The speed of local rendering is very slow, but the speed of local deprecated (WebGL) rendering is very fast now.?


2) Regarding loading the .stl file, I did not run into the same issue as you did, i.e. the .stl file loaded without any problems.? The paraviewweb I am running was built from master which is a day or so old, so I'm wondering what version you may have compiled?
Kai's Response:

I tried .stl file a couple of times again and still the same. I do not see the geometry in ParaViewWeb, and the log file has the same error message as before. Currently my Ubuntu 14.04 has ParaViewWeb - 4.4 version. I built this on 09/22/2015. The following is the commands I used to obtain the source:
Get ParaViewWeb by a Specific Version
git clone git://paraview.org/ParaView.git srccd srcgit checkout v4.4.0git submodule update --init

When I build ParaViewWeb 4.3 in July, 2015, I used the following commands:

Get the latest ParaViewWeb source?
git clone git://paraview.org/stage/ParaView.git srccd src ? ? ? ? ?git submodule update --init


I have put my responses inline below again ....

Did you build the ParaView desktop application in the same build as the version you're using to run ParaViewWeb?? Maybe you could try to take one of the standard ParaView datasets and try to load it in ParaViewWeb, and see if you have the same issue you mentioned above.? To get this data if you don't already have it, go here:
http://www.paraview.org/download/

And under "Type of Download", choose "Data, Documentation, and Tutorials".? Once you get this data, try opening the "disk_out_ref.ex2" file in ParaViewWeb.? If you see the same issue as above, then there could be something going on with the way you have built ParaView, which we can try to figure out at that point.? If you do not see the same issue as above, then perhaps you could send me (off the list) a sample data file I could use to try to replicate the problem and debug it on this end.

Kai's Response?
I did not build the ParaView desktop application. I installed ParaView 4.1.0 through the Ubuntu terminal using ?sudo?apt-get?install?paraviewopenfoam410?.?
I tested files with?local?ParaView desktop application as well as local ParaViewWeb. My Ubuntu 14.04 server does not have ParaView application, and it has only ParaViewWeb. Both server and local ParaViewWeb produce the same issues.?
I have tested?"disk_out_ref.ex2" file in ParaViewWeb, and it seems to be okay. I will send you the sample data files privately.?

Just so I am clear.? Your "local" version is the one you install via apt-get?? And the Ubuntu 14.04 server version is the one you built yourself?? Did you download a source bundle to build the server one?? If so, do you know what version you downloaded and built on your server?
Kai's Response:

I apologize for the confusion. I built both my "local" and "sever" ParaViewWeb 4.4.0 with OSMesa using the following commands:
git clone git://paraview.org/ParaView.git srccd srcgit checkout v4.4.0git submodule update --init
I had to use git checkout v4.4.0 because last time the repository head was 4.3 version.?
My "local" ParaView 4.1 desktop application was installed via apt-get. When I said ParaView desktop application, I am not referring to the ParaViewWeb at all. I always refer ParaView and ParaViewWeb as two applications.?
Please note that I had also tried ParaViewWeb 4.1 and 4.3 on both my "local" and "server", they both had the same issues in loading the ASCII STL file and rendering the output fields, which would be the same issues currently I am experiencing in ParaViewWeb 4.4.
?


Issue 2:?
If I do the following selections on the ParaViewWeb, I always receive?src/VTK/Common/Core/vtkDataArrayTemplate.h:191: T vtkDataArrayTemplate<T>::GetValue(vtkIdType) [with T = float; vtkIdType = long long int]: Assertion `id >= 0 && id < this->Size' failed?message in the log file and cause the web socket connection closed. ?

I checked HTTP traffic, it has the following message. I assume the connection is closed because of the above error.?



I wonder if the server side process crashed as a result of the error you see in the log file?? That would explain the websocket connection error.? Again, trying a known data set like "disk_out_ref.ex2" may help us to pinpoint problem which caused the error output you saw above.

Kai's Response?
My?unintelligent question is how could I determine if the server side process crashed??



One approach: Use a terminal on the machine where ParaViewWeb is running and type:

ps -ef | grep pvpython
If the process is running, you should see a pvpython instance running, where your pv_web_visualizer.py script is the argument, along with any other arguments your launcher provided when it started the process for you.? Something like:
/path/to/paraview/build/bin/pvpython /path/to/paraview/build/lib/site-packages/paraview/web/pv_web_visualizer.py --port 9999 --data-dir /blah/blah/blah
In the case of the cube you shared with me, the process did indeed crash as a result of the steps you provided.
Kai's Response:

Thank you for the command and the explanations.

Issue 3: Slow ParaViewWeb
My ParaViewWeb is very slow. Even I change the rendering mode to WebGL, It is still very slow. The Ubuntu 14.04 Sever ?specifications are the following:
- 8 Cores?- 8 GB RAM??- 2.3 Ghz processors



To get faster rendering with OSMesa, you may try building a recent version of OSMesa using Gallium + LLVMPipe.? See here:
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/ParaView_And_Mesa_3D

But even that won't be as fast as hardware rendering (not using OSMesa).? I'm not sure why you don't see a speedup when switching to WebGL, though, for if your data is small enough to all fit in within the GPU of your desktop or laptop, then it should be faster than offscreen rendering on the server, once the data is loaded.
Kai's Response?

I believe my build?is based on??recent version of OSMesa using Gallium + LLVMPipe
Mesa 9.2.2 OSMesa Gallium llvmpipe

make -j4
autoreconf -fi
./configure \CXXFLAGS="-O2 -g -DDEFAULT_SOFTWARE_DEPTH_BITS=31"?\CFLAGS="-O2 -g -DDEFAULT_SOFTWARE_DEPTH_BITS=31"?\--disable-xvmc \--disable-glx \--disable-dri \--with-dri-drivers=""?\--with-gallium-drivers="swrast"?\--enable-texture-float?\--disable-shared-glapi \--disable-egl \--with-egl-platforms=""?\--enable-gallium-osmesa \--enable-gallium-llvm=yes \--with-llvm-shared-libs \--prefix=/opt/mesa/9.2.2/llvmpipe

make?-j2
make?-j4 install


This looks fine to me, though I believe OSMesa Gallium llvmpipe has moved along quite a few versions since that documentation was written, so building a more recent one could be something to try.?

When I built ParaViewWeb, The following is what I changed when I generated the cmake file:
PARAVIEW_ENABLE_PYTHON ?????ONPARAVIEW_BUILD_QT_GUI ??????OFFCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX ???????/.../ParaView/installVTK_USE_X ??????????????????OFFOPENGL_INCLUDE_DIR ?????????/opt/mesa/9.2.2/llvmpipe/includeOPENGL_gl_LIBRARYOPENGL_glu_LIBRARY ?????????/opt/mesa/9.2.2/llvmpipe/lib/libGLU.soVTK_OPENGL_HAS_OSMESA ??????ONOSMESA_INCLUDE_DIR ?????????/opt/mesa/9.2.2/llvmpipe/includeOSMESA_LIBRARY ?????????????/opt/mesa/9.2.2/llvmpipe/lib/libOSMesa.so


Please feel free to correct me if you believe you did not?build a recent version of OSMesa using Gallium + LLVMPipe

I will send you two data files. First one is an ASCII STL file (issue 1) and second one is the issue rendering output fields (issue 2). Thank you for your help!
Please let me know if you need anything from me.?



One other thing that could be useful for us to know is what kind of network is between your browser and the server.? When local rendering is enabled, the server's camera is still synchronized with with camera in the browser so that if you switch back to image delivery, you won't see some unexpected camera angle.? If the network is *really* slow, this could perhaps keep the local rendering from being as fast as possible.? But it seems like it would have to be really slow.

Kai's Response:

I would try to build OSMesa Gallium llvmpipe ?to the latest version.?

When you said what kind of network between my browser and the server, I assume you are referring to the Internet speed. Please correct me if I am off the topic here. I did the speed test a few times, and I have the download speed in the range of 15-30 Mbps and upload speed between 25-40 Mbps. However, when I load ParaView datasets in ParaViewWeb, it seem to load quick fast on my end when I switch to the local rendering mode. I am not sure what may have been the issue before. ?

I am still having issue with local rendering (Local VGL or Local Deprecated) on my cube data file even I tried your workaround, and I am still not able to load my ASCII .stl file.?

Please let me know.?


Thank you!
Kai L.

 Hello Kai,
? ?Regarding the data files you shared, I did some testing and found some things out:
1) Regarding using local rendering on the cube data file: It seems that with local rendering, we may not properly handle coloring by arrays where the data range is 0 (e.g. the range of T in your case was?[303.1499938964844, 303.1499938964844]).? I was able to use local rendering by first loading the data, then choosing a local rendering approach (either worked fine), and then going back and coloring by T.? This could be a workaround if you need to test the speed of local rendering vs remote.
2) Regarding loading the .stl file, I did not run into the same issue as you did, i.e. the .stl file loaded without any problems.? The paraviewweb I am running was built from master which is a day or so old, so I'm wondering what version you may have compiled?

Issue 1:?Loading ASCII stl file
When I try to load my ASCII stl file on the ParaviewWeb, I receive the following error message in my log file. However, desktop ParaView application loads the file fine.?

Did you build the ParaView desktop application in the same build as the version you're using to run ParaViewWeb?? Maybe you could try to take one of the standard ParaView datasets and try to load it in ParaViewWeb, and see if you have the same issue you mentioned above.? To get this data if you don't already have it, go here:
http://www.paraview.org/download/

And under "Type of Download", choose "Data, Documentation, and Tutorials".? Once you get this data, try opening the "disk_out_ref.ex2" file in ParaViewWeb.? If you see the same issue as above, then there could be something going on with the way you have built ParaView, which we can try to figure out at that point.? If you do not see the same issue as above, then perhaps you could send me (off the list) a sample data file I could use to try to replicate the problem and debug it on this end.

Kai's Response?
I did not build the ParaView desktop application. I installed ParaView 4.1.0 through the Ubuntu terminal using ?sudo?apt-get?install?paraviewopenfoam410?.?
I tested files with?local?ParaView desktop application as well as local ParaViewWeb. My Ubuntu 14.04 server does not have ParaView application, and it has only ParaViewWeb. Both server and local ParaViewWeb produce the same issues.?
I have tested?"disk_out_ref.ex2" file in ParaViewWeb, and it seems to be okay. I will send you the sample data files privately.?

Just so I am clear.? Your "local" version is the one you install via apt-get?? And the Ubuntu 14.04 server version is the one you built yourself?? Did you download a source bundle to build the server one?? If so, do you know what version you downloaded and built on your server??


Issue 2:?
If I do the following selections on the ParaViewWeb, I always receive?src/VTK/Common/Core/vtkDataArrayTemplate.h:191: T vtkDataArrayTemplate<T>::GetValue(vtkIdType) [with T = float; vtkIdType = long long int]: Assertion `id >= 0 && id < this->Size' failed?message in the log file and cause the web socket connection closed. ?

I checked HTTP traffic, it has the following message. I assume the connection is closed because of the above error.?



I wonder if the server side process crashed as a result of the error you see in the log file?? That would explain the websocket connection error.? Again, trying a known data set like "disk_out_ref.ex2" may help us to pinpoint problem which caused the error output you saw above.

Kai's Response?
My?unintelligent question is how could I determine if the server side process crashed??



One approach: Use a terminal on the machine where ParaViewWeb is running and type:

ps -ef | grep pvpython
If the process is running, you should see a pvpython instance running, where your pv_web_visualizer.py script is the argument, along with any other arguments your launcher provided when it started the process for you.? Something like:
/path/to/paraview/build/bin/pvpython /path/to/paraview/build/lib/site-packages/paraview/web/pv_web_visualizer.py --port 9999 --data-dir /blah/blah/blah
In the case of the cube you shared with me, the process did indeed crash as a result of the steps you provided.?


?
Issue 3: Slow ParaViewWeb
My ParaViewWeb is very slow. Even I change the rendering mode to WebGL, It is still very slow. The Ubuntu 14.04 Sever ?specifications are the following:
- 8 Cores?- 8 GB RAM??- 2.3 Ghz processors



To get faster rendering with OSMesa, you may try building a recent version of OSMesa using Gallium + LLVMPipe.? See here:
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/ParaView_And_Mesa_3D

But even that won't be as fast as hardware rendering (not using OSMesa).? I'm not sure why you don't see a speedup when switching to WebGL, though, for if your data is small enough to all fit in within the GPU of your desktop or laptop, then it should be faster than offscreen rendering on the server, once the data is loaded.
Kai's Response?

I believe my build?is based on??recent version of OSMesa using Gallium + LLVMPipe
Mesa 9.2.2 OSMesa Gallium llvmpipe

make -j4
autoreconf -fi
./configure \CXXFLAGS="-O2 -g -DDEFAULT_SOFTWARE_DEPTH_BITS=31" \CFLAGS="-O2 -g -DDEFAULT_SOFTWARE_DEPTH_BITS=31" \--disable-xvmc \--disable-glx \--disable-dri \--with-dri-drivers="" \--with-gallium-drivers="swrast" \--enable-texture-float \--disable-shared-glapi \--disable-egl \--with-egl-platforms="" \--enable-gallium-osmesa \--enable-gallium-llvm=yes \--with-llvm-shared-libs \--prefix=/opt/mesa/9.2.2/llvmpipe

make -j2
make -j4 install


This looks fine to me, though I believe OSMesa Gallium llvmpipe has moved along quite a few versions since that documentation was written, so building a more recent one could be something to try.?

When I built ParaViewWeb, The following is what I changed when I generated the cmake file:
PARAVIEW_ENABLE_PYTHON ?????ONPARAVIEW_BUILD_QT_GUI ??????OFFCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX ???????/.../ParaView/installVTK_USE_X ??????????????????OFFOPENGL_INCLUDE_DIR ?????????/opt/mesa/9.2.2/llvmpipe/includeOPENGL_gl_LIBRARYOPENGL_glu_LIBRARY ?????????/opt/mesa/9.2.2/llvmpipe/lib/libGLU.soVTK_OPENGL_HAS_OSMESA ??????ONOSMESA_INCLUDE_DIR ?????????/opt/mesa/9.2.2/llvmpipe/includeOSMESA_LIBRARY ?????????????/opt/mesa/9.2.2/llvmpipe/lib/libOSMesa.so


Please feel free to correct me if you believe you did not build a recent version of OSMesa using Gallium + LLVMPipe

I will send you two data files. First one is an ASCII STL file (issue 1) and second one is the issue rendering output fields (issue 2). Thank you for your help!

Hello Kai,

   So in doing some more testing it seems, that the problem may actually be
with the webgl exporter when you set the representation to "Surface with
edges".  Can you try to see if you have the problem with just "Surface"?
In that case, there is potentially a bug in the geometry exporter.

   Regarding the stl file issue, I did follow the same steps to build
ParaViewWeb which you provided (just using hardware rendering rather than
OSMesa) and I see the same issue you described.  So in this case, it seems
like maybe some commit since the 4.4 release has fixed an issue with the
stl reader.  If you are able to get the latest master and build it, that
could fix your stl loading problem.

Hope this helps.

Cheers,
Scott

Dear Scott:
I do not have problems setting the representation to "Surface" with color "T" in local deprecated rendering mode. However, I do get the same error message with?representation set to ?"Surface with edges" or "Wireframe"?with color "T" in local deprecated rendering.?
But "Surface with edges" and "Wireframe"?with color "T" in remote rendering are fine.?

When I click "choose?palette" , select "Cool to Warm" and click apply properties for my cube data sample, it does not apply to the?geometry. One thing I have noticed is that it seems to have post backs twice because the drop-down menu selection goes from "Cool to Warm" to "choose platter" ?after I clicked apply properties. Could this be my sever response issue?
Also there is always ?latency between user inputs and?visualization. What I meant is that when users select and apply different properties to the?visualization, it seems to take awhile to apply those properties. For example, color management's representation and color selections. Could the latency be due to our ubuntu sever specifications?
Could you please provide me the latest master git HTTPS clone URL ? I can try and rebuild the ParaViewWeb 4.4 with OSMesa.?

My new question is that if we would like to start ParaViewWeb with our own default ?view. For example, set the representation always to "Surface with edges", Set color always to "T" , set palette always to "Cool to Warm" and etc. Do we simply modify the HTML markup and possibly modify/add JavaScript to those files in www directory??. What would be the best way to handle this situation?
Sorry for all the questions. Thank you very much!

 Hello Kai,
? ?So in doing some more testing it seems, that the problem may actually be with the webgl exporter when you set the representation to "Surface with edges".? Can you try to see if you have the problem with just "Surface"?? In that case, there is potentially a bug in the geometry exporter.
? ?Regarding the stl file issue, I did follow the same steps to build ParaViewWeb which you provided (just using hardware rendering rather than OSMesa) and I see the same issue you described.? So in this case, it seems like maybe some commit since the 4.4 release has fixed an issue with the stl reader.? If you are able to get the latest master and build it, that could fix your stl loading problem.
Hope this helps.

Dear Scott:
Thank you for the testings.
?1) Regarding using local rendering on the cube data file: It seems that with local rendering, we may not properly handle coloring by arrays where the data range is 0 (e.g. the range of T in your case was?[303.1499938964844, 303.1499938964844]).? I was able to use local rendering by first loading the data, then choosing a local rendering approach (either worked fine), and then going back and coloring by T.? This could be a workaround if you need to test the speed of local rendering vs remote.

Kai's Response:
My?local deprecated (WebGL) rendering seems quite fast now when I load ParaView Datasets.?
I was not able to use local rendering (Local VGL or Local Deprecated) on my cube data file. I first loaded the data, chose local (Deprecated) option and then went back to color by T. I got the same error message: WebSocket connection to 'ws://XXXX:8080/proxy?sessionId=7bb6e67a-63a9-11e5-9b44-00155dd73e0d' failed: Error during WebSocket handshake: Unexpected response code: 503 . I believe the server side process indeed crashed. However, remote rendering does seem to work fine with T color. The speed of local rendering is very slow, but the speed of local deprecated (WebGL) rendering is very fast now.?


2) Regarding loading the .stl file, I did not run into the same issue as you did, i.e. the .stl file loaded without any problems.? The paraviewweb I am running was built from master which is a day or so old, so I'm wondering what version you may have compiled?
Kai's Response:

I tried .stl file a couple of times again and still the same. I do not see the geometry in ParaViewWeb, and the log file has the same error message as before. Currently my Ubuntu 14.04 has ParaViewWeb - 4.4 version. I built this on 09/22/2015. The following is the commands I used to obtain the source:
Get ParaViewWeb by a Specific Version
git clone git://paraview.org/ParaView.git srccd srcgit checkout v4.4.0git submodule update --init

When I build ParaViewWeb 4.3 in July, 2015, I used the following commands:

Get the latest ParaViewWeb source?
git clone git://paraview.org/stage/ParaView.git srccd src ? ? ? ? ?git submodule update --init


I have put my responses inline below again ....

Dear Scott,
Thanks for your quick response, I have also put my?responses inline below with light blue color :





Issue 1:?Loading ASCII stl file
When I try to load my ASCII stl file on the ParaviewWeb, I receive the following error message in my log file. However, desktop ParaView application loads the file fine.?

Did you build the ParaView desktop application in the same build as the version you're using to run ParaViewWeb?? Maybe you could try to take one of the standard ParaView datasets and try to load it in ParaViewWeb, and see if you have the same issue you mentioned above.? To get this data if you don't already have it, go here:
http://www.paraview.org/download/

And under "Type of Download", choose "Data, Documentation, and Tutorials".? Once you get this data, try opening the "disk_out_ref.ex2" file in ParaViewWeb.? If you see the same issue as above, then there could be something going on with the way you have built ParaView, which we can try to figure out at that point.? If you do not see the same issue as above, then perhaps you could send me (off the list) a sample data file I could use to try to replicate the problem and debug it on this end.

Kai's Response?
I did not build the ParaView desktop application. I installed ParaView 4.1.0 through the Ubuntu terminal using ?sudo?apt-get?install?paraviewopenfoam410?.?
I tested files with?local?ParaView desktop application as well as local ParaViewWeb. My Ubuntu 14.04 server does not have ParaView application, and it has only ParaViewWeb. Both server and local ParaViewWeb produce the same issues.?
I have tested?"disk_out_ref.ex2" file in ParaViewWeb, and it seems to be okay. I will send you the sample data files privately.?

Just so I am clear.? Your "local" version is the one you install via apt-get?? And the Ubuntu 14.04 server version is the one you built yourself?? Did you download a source bundle to build the server one?? If so, do you know what version you downloaded and built on your server?
Kai's Response:

I apologize for the confusion. I built both my "local" and "sever" ParaViewWeb 4.4.0 with OSMesa using the following commands:
git clone git://paraview.org/ParaView.git srccd srcgit checkout v4.4.0git submodule update --init
I had to use git checkout v4.4.0 because last time the repository head was 4.3 version.?
My "local" ParaView 4.1 desktop application was installed via apt-get. When I said ParaView desktop application, I am not referring to the ParaViewWeb at all. I always refer ParaView and ParaViewWeb as two applications.?
Please note that I had also tried ParaViewWeb 4.1 and 4.3 on both my "local" and "server", they both had the same issues in loading the ASCII STL file and rendering the output fields, which would be the same issues currently I am experiencing in ParaViewWeb 4.4.

My?unintelligent question is how could I determine if the server side process crashed??



One approach: Use a terminal on the machine where ParaViewWeb is running and type:

ps -ef | grep pvpython
If the process is running, you should see a pvpython instance running, where your pv_web_visualizer.py script is the argument, along with any other arguments your launcher provided when it started the process for you.? Something like:
/path/to/paraview/build/bin/pvpython /path/to/paraview/build/lib/site-packages/paraview/web/pv_web_visualizer.py --port 9999 --data-dir /blah/blah/blah
In the case of the cube you shared with me, the process did indeed crash as a result of the steps you provided.
Kai's Response:

Thank you for the command and the explanations.

Issue 3: Slow ParaViewWeb
My ParaViewWeb is very slow. Even I change the rendering mode to WebGL, It is still very slow. The Ubuntu 14.04 Sever ?specifications are the following:
- 8 Cores?- 8 GB RAM??- 2.3 Ghz processors



To get faster rendering with OSMesa, you may try building a recent version of OSMesa using Gallium + LLVMPipe.? See here:
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/ParaView_And_Mesa_3D

But even that won't be as fast as hardware rendering (not using OSMesa).? I'm not sure why you don't see a speedup when switching to WebGL, though, for if your data is small enough to all fit in within the GPU of your desktop or laptop, then it should be faster than offscreen rendering on the server, once the data is loaded.
Kai's Response?

I believe my build?is based on??recent version of OSMesa using Gallium + LLVMPipe
Mesa 9.2.2 OSMesa Gallium llvmpipe

make -j4
autoreconf -fi
./configure \CXXFLAGS="-O2 -g -DDEFAULT_SOFTWARE_DEPTH_BITS=31"?\CFLAGS="-O2 -g -DDEFAULT_SOFTWARE_DEPTH_BITS=31"?\--disable-xvmc \--disable-glx \--disable-dri \--with-dri-drivers=""?\--with-gallium-drivers="swrast"?\--enable-texture-float?\--disable-shared-glapi \--disable-egl \--with-egl-platforms=""?\--enable-gallium-osmesa \--enable-gallium-llvm=yes \--with-llvm-shared-libs \--prefix=/opt/mesa/9.2.2/llvmpipe

make?-j2
make?-j4 install


This looks fine to me, though I believe OSMesa Gallium llvmpipe has moved along quite a few versions since that documentation was written, so building a more recent one could be something to try.?

When I built ParaViewWeb, The following is what I changed when I generated the cmake file:
PARAVIEW_ENABLE_PYTHON ?????ONPARAVIEW_BUILD_QT_GUI ??????OFFCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX ???????/.../ParaView/installVTK_USE_X ??????????????????OFFOPENGL_INCLUDE_DIR ?????????/opt/mesa/9.2.2/llvmpipe/includeOPENGL_gl_LIBRARYOPENGL_glu_LIBRARY ?????????/opt/mesa/9.2.2/llvmpipe/lib/libGLU.so

I think it probably is applying the color palette you choose to the
geometry.  Think of the color palette as the starting point for your
coloring scheme, and from there you can add and remove colors from the
lookup table at will.  For this reason, we don't keep the value you choose
for color palette in the drop-down box, because as soon as you adjust the
lookup table, that palette name would no longer match the lookup table
you're using.  Since the default color palette is "Cool to Warm", you don't
notice any change when you choose that one again.  And since your data
arrays have a numeric range of 0, you should just see blue.  If you change
the color palette to "Red to Blue Rainbow", in your case, you will see the
data become all red, though the color palette drop-down will not change.

Some latency is expected, but I guess the question is how much latency you
are seeing when changing properties and applying them.  A second to a
couple of seconds is normal to apply property changes, but it could vary
with the data you are visualizing.

We have moved to gitlab recently, and I don't think you should need an
account or anything to access the repo there.  Try this url:

https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview.git

On the main gitlab page (https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview) you
should find links to the new development workflow documentation which can
guide you through the process.

That is probably not the way I would go with it, but I think this is beyond
the scope of normal mailing list support questions.  If you are interested
in customizing the Web Visualizer for your own needs, you could consider a
support contract.  See here for some information:

Hope this helps.

Subject: [Paraview] Direct link to ParaView sources not working with wget
Message-ID: <568A0346-2D2E-41BA-B2F1-6E8402E6B95C@aia.rwth-aachen.de>

Dear ParaView team,

Maybe it?s just something that?s bothering me, but whenever I need to install a new version of ParaView on our cluster, I have to first download it to my client and then scp it to the final destination. Trying to use wget to get the sources using the ?Show direct link" feature just results in downloading an (empty) "download.php?submit=Download? file to the machine. I am not an expert on wget and http, but if this is a small thing to fix, I would be very grateful :)

Regards,

Michael

Thanks Utkarsh,

I?ve decided to stick with my own solution for the time being ? having to create extra vtkSMxxx classes for all the sources adds too much maintenance to the code, whereas just adding an #include seems cleaner. When my immediate deadline has passed I?ll look again at it.

Thanks

JB

Attached is the solution, there a small mistake in my origin script:

 vtkClientServerStream stream;
 stream << vtkClientServerStream::Invoke
              << VTKOBJECT(proxy)
               << SetValues
               << maxValues
               << stream.InsertArray(values, maxValues)
               << vtkClientServerStream::End;

I am sure you're misinterpreting the code. I created the extra vtkSM class
in my example only so that I can do the "SendStream" somewhere. Anycase,
I'll let you figure that out when you have the time.

Subject: [Paraview] ParaViewWeb - Issues with Loading ASCII STL file &
 Rendering the Output Fields

Dear Scott,
Should I just wait for the next patch release for the local rendering (WebGL)?"Surface with edges" issue??

I just tried the following commands to obtain the source from the GitLab and rebuilt the ParaViewWeb 4.4 with OSMesa, but it still does not resolve my stl loading issue. Am I still not getting latest 4.4 release with all the commits?.
git clone?https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview.git?srccd src ? ? ? ? ?git submodule update --init

On the other hand, I also tried to download and build from master .tar.gz file from the GitLab, but it seems not to have the latest?submodule. I got the following error message:
CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:625 (include):? ?include could not find load file:
? ? ?vtkModuleAPI


?CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:626 (include):? ?include could not find load file:
? ? ?vtkModuleMacros


?CMake Error at CMake/ParaViewMacros.cmake:416 (include):? ?include could not find load file:
? ? ?vtkForwardingExecutable

I am not sure how to update to the latest?submodule since I did not use the git to clone the source.
Thank you again!
Kai L.

Dear Scott:
I do not have problems setting the representation to "Surface" with color "T" in local deprecated rendering mode. However, I do get the same error message with?representation set to ?"Surface with edges" or "Wireframe"?with color "T" in local deprecated rendering.?
But "Surface with edges" and "Wireframe"?with color "T" in remote rendering are fine.?

When I click "choose?palette" , select "Cool to Warm" and click apply properties for my cube data sample, it does not apply to the?geometry. One thing I have noticed is that it seems to have post backs twice because the drop-down menu selection goes from "Cool to Warm" to "choose platter" ?after I clicked apply properties. Could this be my sever response issue?


I think it probably is applying the color palette you choose to the geometry.? Think of the color palette as the starting point for your coloring scheme, and from there you can add and remove colors from the lookup table at will.? For this reason, we don't keep the value you choose for color palette in the drop-down box, because as soon as you adjust the lookup table, that palette name would no longer match the lookup table you're using.? Since the default color palette is "Cool to Warm", you don't notice any change when you choose that one again.? And since your data arrays have a numeric range of 0, you should just see blue.? If you change the color palette to "Red to Blue Rainbow", in your case, you will see the data become all red, though the color palette drop-down will not change.?
Also there is always ?latency between user inputs and?visualization. What I meant is that when users select and apply different properties to the?visualization, it seems to take awhile to apply those properties. For example, color management's representation and color selections. Could the latency be due to our ubuntu sever specifications?


Some latency is expected, but I guess the question is how much latency you are seeing when changing properties and applying them.? A second to a couple of seconds is normal to apply property changes, but it could vary with the data you are visualizing.?
Could you please provide me the latest master git HTTPS clone URL ? I can try and rebuild the ParaViewWeb 4.4 with OSMesa.?



We have moved to gitlab recently, and I don't think you should need an account or anything to access the repo there.? Try this url:
https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview.git

On the main gitlab page (https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview) you should find links to the new development workflow documentation which can guide you through the process.?
My new question is that if we would like to start ParaViewWeb with our own default ?view. For example, set the representation always to "Surface with edges", Set color always to "T" , set palette always to "Cool to Warm" and etc. Do we simply modify the HTML markup and possibly modify/add JavaScript to those files in www directory??. What would be the best way to handle this situation?


That is probably not the way I would go with it, but I think this is beyond the scope of normal mailing list support questions.? If you are interested in customizing the Web Visualizer for your own needs, you could consider a support contract.? See here for some information:
http://www.kitware.com/products/consulting.html

Hope this helps.
Cheers,Scott?
Sorry for all the questions. Thank you very much!

 Hello Kai,
? ?So in doing some more testing it seems, that the problem may actually be with the webgl exporter when you set the representation to "Surface with edges".? Can you try to see if you have the problem with just "Surface"?? In that case, there is potentially a bug in the geometry exporter.
? ?Regarding the stl file issue, I did follow the same steps to build ParaViewWeb which you provided (just using hardware rendering rather than OSMesa) and I see the same issue you described.? So in this case, it seems like maybe some commit since the 4.4 release has fixed an issue with the stl reader.? If you are able to get the latest master and build it, that could fix your stl loading problem.
Hope this helps.
Cheers,Scott

Dear Scott:
Thank you for the testings.
?1) Regarding using local rendering on the cube data file: It seems that with local rendering, we may not properly handle coloring by arrays where the data range is 0 (e.g. the range of T in your case was?[303.1499938964844, 303.1499938964844]).? I was able to use local rendering by first loading the data, then choosing a local rendering approach (either worked fine), and then going back and coloring by T.? This could be a workaround if you need to test the speed of local rendering vs remote.

Kai's Response:
My?local deprecated (WebGL) rendering seems quite fast now when I load ParaView Datasets.?
I was not able to use local rendering (Local VGL or Local Deprecated) on my cube data file. I first loaded the data, chose local (Deprecated) option and then went back to color by T. I got the same error message: WebSocket connection to 'ws://XXXX:8080/proxy?sessionId=7bb6e67a-63a9-11e5-9b44-00155dd73e0d' failed: Error during WebSocket handshake: Unexpected response code: 503 . I believe the server side process indeed crashed. However, remote rendering does seem to work fine with T color. The speed of local rendering is very slow, but the speed of local deprecated (WebGL) rendering is very fast now.?


2) Regarding loading the .stl file, I did not run into the same issue as you did, i.e. the .stl file loaded without any problems.? The paraviewweb I am running was built from master which is a day or so old, so I'm wondering what version you may have compiled?
Kai's Response:

I tried .stl file a couple of times again and still the same. I do not see the geometry in ParaViewWeb, and the log file has the same error message as before. Currently my Ubuntu 14.04 has ParaViewWeb - 4.4 version. I built this on 09/22/2015. The following is the commands I used to obtain the source:
Get ParaViewWeb by a Specific Version
git clone git://paraview.org/ParaView.git srccd srcgit checkout v4.4.0git submodule update --init

When I build ParaViewWeb 4.3 in July, 2015, I used the following commands:

Get the latest ParaViewWeb source?
git clone git://paraview.org/stage/ParaView.git srccd src ? ? ? ? ?git submodule update --init


I have put my responses inline below again ....

Dear Scott,
Thanks for your quick response, I have also put my?responses inline below with light blue color :





Issue 1:?Loading ASCII stl file
When I try to load my ASCII stl file on the ParaviewWeb, I receive the following error message in my log file. However, desktop ParaView application loads the file fine.?
ERROR: In /home/user/ParaViewWeb/ParaView/src/VTK/IO/Geometry/vtkSTLReader.cxx, line 461vtkSTLReader (0x5d89b50): STLReader: error while reading file /home/user/ParaViewWeb/data/Mitchell_Lee_Administration_ReckordArmory_.stl at line 14: unable to read reading point.

Debug: Off? Modified Time: 225417? Reference Count: 1? Registered Events: (none)? Request: REQUEST_DATA? FROM_OUTPUT_PORT: 0? ALGORITHM_AFTER_FORWARD: 1? FORWARD_DIRECTION: 0


Did you build the ParaView desktop application in the same build as the version you're using to run ParaViewWeb?? Maybe you could try to take one of the standard ParaView datasets and try to load it in ParaViewWeb, and see if you have the same issue you mentioned above.? To get this data if you don't already have it, go here:
http://www.paraview.org/download/

And under "Type of Download", choose "Data, Documentation, and Tutorials".? Once you get this data, try opening the "disk_out_ref.ex2" file in ParaViewWeb.? If you see the same issue as above, then there could be something going on with the way you have built ParaView, which we can try to figure out at that point.? If you do not see the same issue as above, then perhaps you could send me (off the list) a sample data file I could use to try to replicate the problem and debug it on this end.

Kai's Response?
I did not build the ParaView desktop application. I installed ParaView 4.1.0 through the Ubuntu terminal using ?sudo?apt-get?install?paraviewopenfoam410?.?
I tested files with?local?ParaView desktop application as well as local ParaViewWeb. My Ubuntu 14.04 server does not have ParaView application, and it has only ParaViewWeb. Both server and local ParaViewWeb produce the same issues.?
I have tested?"disk_out_ref.ex2" file in ParaViewWeb, and it seems to be okay. I will send you the sample data files privately.?

Just so I am clear.? Your "local" version is the one you install via apt-get?? And the Ubuntu 14.04 server version is the one you built yourself?? Did you download a source bundle to build the server one?? If so, do you know what version you downloaded and built on your server?
Kai's Response:

I apologize for the confusion. I built both my "local" and "sever" ParaViewWeb 4.4.0 with OSMesa using the following commands:
git clone git://paraview.org/ParaView.git srccd srcgit checkout v4.4.0git submodule update --init
I had to use git checkout v4.4.0 because last time the repository head was 4.3 version.?
My "local" ParaView 4.1 desktop application was installed via apt-get. When I said ParaView desktop application, I am not referring to the ParaViewWeb at all. I always refer ParaView and ParaViewWeb as two applications.?
Please note that I had also tried ParaViewWeb 4.1 and 4.3 on both my "local" and "server", they both had the same issues in loading the ASCII STL file and rendering the output fields, which would be the same issues currently I am experiencing in ParaViewWeb 4.4.
?


Issue 2:?
If I do the following selections on the ParaViewWeb, I always receive?src/VTK/Common/Core/vtkDataArrayTemplate.h:191: T vtkDataArrayTemplate<T>::GetValue(vtkIdType) [with T = float; vtkIdType = long long int]: Assertion `id >= 0 && id < this->Size' failed?message in the log file and cause the web socket connection closed. ?

I checked HTTP traffic, it has the following message. I assume the connection is closed because of the above error.?



I wonder if the server side process crashed as a result of the error you see in the log file?? That would explain the websocket connection error.? Again, trying a known data set like "disk_out_ref.ex2" may help us to pinpoint problem which caused the error output you saw above.

Kai's Response?
My?unintelligent question is how could I determine if the server side process crashed??



One approach: Use a terminal on the machine where ParaViewWeb is running and type:

ps -ef | grep pvpython
If the process is running, you should see a pvpython instance running, where your pv_web_visualizer.py script is the argument, along with any other arguments your launcher provided when it started the process for you.? Something like:
/path/to/paraview/build/bin/pvpython /path/to/paraview/build/lib/site-packages/paraview/web/pv_web_visualizer.py --port 9999 --data-dir /blah/blah/blah
In the case of the cube you shared with me, the process did indeed crash as a result of the steps you provided.
Kai's Response:

Thank you for the command and the explanations.

Issue 3: Slow ParaViewWeb
My ParaViewWeb is very slow. Even I change the rendering mode to WebGL, It is still very slow. The Ubuntu 14.04 Sever ?specifications are the following:
- 8 Cores?- 8 GB RAM??- 2.3 Ghz processors



To get faster rendering with OSMesa, you may try building a recent version of OSMesa using Gallium + LLVMPipe.? See here:
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/ParaView_And_Mesa_3D

But even that won't be as fast as hardware rendering (not using OSMesa).? I'm not sure why you don't see a speedup when switching to WebGL, though, for if your data is small enough to all fit in within the GPU of your desktop or laptop, then it should be faster than offscreen rendering on the server, once the data is loaded.
Kai's Response?

I believe my build?is based on??recent version of OSMesa using Gallium + LLVMPipe
Mesa 9.2.2 OSMesa Gallium llvmpipe

make -j4
autoreconf -fi
./configure \CXXFLAGS="-O2 -g -DDEFAULT_SOFTWARE_DEPTH_BITS=31"?\CFLAGS="-O2 -g -DDEFAULT_SOFTWARE_DEPTH_BITS=31"?\--disable-xvmc \--disable-glx \--disable-dri \--with-dri-drivers=""?\--with-gallium-drivers="swrast"?\--enable-texture-float?\--disable-shared-glapi \--disable-egl \--with-egl-platforms=""?\--enable-gallium-osmesa \--enable-gallium-llvm=yes \--with-llvm-shared-libs \--prefix=/opt/mesa/9.2.2/llvmpipe

make?-j2
make?-j4 install


This looks fine to me, though I believe OSMesa Gallium llvmpipe has moved along quite a few versions since that documentation was written, so building a more recent one could be something to try.?

When I built ParaViewWeb, The following is what I changed when I generated the cmake file:
PARAVIEW_ENABLE_PYTHON ?????ONPARAVIEW_BUILD_QT_GUI ??????OFFCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX ???????/.../ParaView/installVTK_USE_X ??????????????????OFFOPENGL_INCLUDE_DIR ?????????/opt/mesa/9.2.2/llvmpipe/includeOPENGL_gl_LIBRARYOPENGL_glu_LIBRARY ?????????/opt/mesa/9.2.2/llvmpipe/lib/libGLU.so
...

Multiblock data sets aren't required to have the same fields defined over
all of the blocks. That doesn't necessarily mean this can't be done, it
just means it may not be quite as straightforward and/or clear as for the
data set readers.

Thanks for the reply - the ?Shade? setting was the key.  Am I right in inferring this property is not exposed for unstructured grids?  If I threshold or clip the image data I can no longer turn ?Shade? on.

Does GPU acceleration work on OS X presently?  Whenever I switch to GPU the image disappears; rendering on the CPU takes a long time.  Would this be more likely to work if I compiled the OpenGL2 version?

Cheers

Right, it is only available for image data one.

Because that creates a unstructured grid I believe.

GPURayCast volume mapper which uses vtkImageData works on Mac if you use

Yes, please see my comment above.

Hi Utkarsh,

Thanks for the quick fix! I still end up with a file named "download.php?submit=Download&version=v4.4&type=source&os=all&downloadFile=ParaView-v4.4.0-source.tar.gz? (and that can be fixed using "-O filename?), but at least the downloading works ;)

Hi Berk,

Finally managed to grab an allocation of some Tesla K40 nodes on our cluster, to check GPU rendering of the full 17GB file with 2 x 12GB GPUs. I see the same thing as I did with OSMesa rendering.

The 9GB downsampled version works great, across 2 nodes both with a single K40. Go up to the 17GB original file and nothing is rendered, no errors. Same behavior with OPENGL or OPENGL2 backends.

This is all on paraview 4.3.1 still ? I need to find time to build OSMesa / MPI versions of 4.4 here. But, does 4.4. have any fixes that would be expected to affect this?

Thanks,

Hey David,

I am hoping to have some time to play around with volume rendering and hopefully tracking this issue, one thing that I wanted to clarify: it sounds from you description that you have a short (2 byte) value. Is that correct?

Thanks,

Hi,

We have been experimenting with using Paraview to display very volumes from very
large TIFF stacks generated by whole-brain microscopy equipment. The test stack
has dimensions of 5,368x10,695x150. Stack is assembled in ImageJ from individual
TIFFs, exported as a RAW and loaded into paraview. Saved as a .vti for
convenience. Can view slices fine in standalone paraview client on a 256GB machine.

When we attempt volume rendering on this data across multiple nodes with MPI
nothing appears in the client. Surface view works as expected. On switching to
volume rendering the client's display will show nothing. There are no messages
from the client or servers - no output.

This is happening when running pvserver across GPU nodes with NVIDIA Tesla
cards, or using CPU only with OSMESA. pvserver memory usage is well below what
we have on the nodes - no memory warnings/errors.

Data is about 17GB, 8 billion cells. If we downsize to ~4GB or ~9GB then we can
get working volume rendering. The 17GB never works regardless of scaling
nodes/mpi processes. The 4/9GB will work on 1 or 2 nodes.

Am confused by the lack of rendering, as we don't have memory issues, or an
other messages at all. Am wondering if there are any inherent limitation, or I'm
missing something stupid.

Thanks,

Dave Trudgian

Hi David,

I have been trying to find some cycles to check this out myself with
ParaView 4.4. Thanks to hardware issues (i.e. my big workstation's disk
dying), I haven't been able to. Good news is that I found issues with
OSMesa + OpenGL2 that we are working through. Give me another 1-1.5 weeks.

Best,

The 9GB downsampled version works great, across 2 nodes both with a single K40. Go up to the 17GB original file and nothing is rendered, no errors. Same behavior with OPENGL or OPENGL2 backends.

This is all on paraview 4.3.1 still ? I need to find time to build OSMesa / MPI versions of 4.4 here. But, does 4.4. have any fixes that would be expected to affect this?

Hi,

We have been experimenting with using Paraview to display very volumes from very
large TIFF stacks generated by whole-brain microscopy equipment. The test stack
has dimensions of 5,368x10,695x150. Stack is assembled in ImageJ from individual
TIFFs, exported as a RAW and loaded into paraview. Saved as a .vti for
convenience. Can view slices fine in standalone paraview client on a 256GB machine.

When we attempt volume rendering on this data across multiple nodes with MPI
nothing appears in the client. Surface view works as expected. On switching to
volume rendering the client's display will show nothing. There are no messages
from the client or servers - no output.

This is happening when running pvserver across GPU nodes with NVIDIA Tesla
cards, or using CPU only with OSMESA. pvserver memory usage is well below what
we have on the nodes - no memory warnings/errors.

Data is about 17GB, 8 billion cells. If we downsize to ~4GB or ~9GB then we can
get working volume rendering. The 17GB never works regardless of scaling
nodes/mpi processes. The 4/9GB will work on 1 or 2 nodes.

Am confused by the lack of rendering, as we don't have memory issues, or an
other messages at all. Am wondering if there are any inherent limitation, or I'm
missing something stupid.

Thanks,

Dave Trudgian

Subject: [Paraview] Build Fail on OS X
Message-ID: <B459F5CC-8172-4DB2-B975-7AD5F29D282C@gmail.com>

Am trying to build Paraview with OpenGL2 backend to enable GPU acceleration under OS X.

I?m using the latest superbuild from git.  The CMake configuration/generation runs fine, and ?make? in the build directory completes without errors.  However, running ?make install? for the final step results in the error:

CMake Error at cmake_install.cmake:39 (file):
  file INSTALL cannot find
  "/Users/xxxx/ParaView/Build/install/Applications/paraview.app?.

I do not get an executable to run

Thanks for any pointers

Message-ID: <A8F89A34-00D2-4C4F-A967-2993C784FB23@udel.edu>

Greetings Paraview community -


Referring to the attached image, I have these alternating white/blueish lines that are the result of having the imaginary field of the B-field =0, and then taking the log of the absolute value of that quantity. There called ?null lines? since that quantity is,n well, null.

 Here?s my question though. Is there anyway for Paraview to give a value for the width of these null lines shown in the image (red line artificially inserted for now)? Is it through the line object?

 One more question - where I have the red line is where I?d like to read off the values. I have other vtk files where the width will change. Is there a way to define this line such that the values change with the width?

Thanks!
 Jesse

Message-ID: <CAPGv+dNaxyWCydW42PY8qPG5vKqv0c=iDc77kfERsNGZS6mM0w@mail.gmail.com>

Hey Guys,

     I'm trying to build Paraview from source on windows and ran into an
issue when trying to configure and qmake QT. I've been following the
directions at http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView:Build_And_Install and
downloaded "qt-everywhere-opensource-src-4.8.2.zip" and unzipped the files.
I opened up a 'Developer Command Prompt for VS2013' and navigated to the
unzipped folder that holds the qt source and typed configure, o for open
source version, and yes to accept the license offers, but then I get an
error when it tries to create qmake.

Creating qmake...
execute: File or path is not found (mingw32-make)
execute: File or path is not found (mingw32-make)
Cleaning qmake failed, return code -1

I thought that opening up the developer command prompt for VS2013 set all
the path variables so that mingw32-make wouldn't be needed, so this may not
be the case. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks!
Andrew Solis

Hello Kai,

   Now after doing a clean build of a recent ParaView master, it seems I
can no longer see the Mitchel.stl file, and the server produces the error
logs you have mentioned somewhere above about the being unable to read the
reading point.  So I would say at this point, there is perhaps a bug in the
stl reader.  I wonder if you would be willing to file a bug report?  Maybe
two while you're at it?

1) stl file load issue, it would be great if you are able to upload a file
that can be used to reproduce the issue, something you don't mind sharing.

2) surface with edges issue in ParaViewWeb when doing local rendering

We are still keeping track of bugs with Mantis for the time being:

http://www.paraview.org/Bug/my_view_page.php

Thanks!  Someone will get around to these when we get some time, but we
probably can't estimate when that will be.

Cheers,
Scott

All,

It appears that the help or Documentation provided in the xml file is not accessible from Paraview.  I could not access it for the original files from the blog, or from mine.   Perhaps I just don?t understand the proper way to access it, but all I got with clicking on ? or hitting F1 was the Paraview manual.  Is there any way to have help text from my xml file accessible in Paraview?

Thanks

Dennis

Hi,

Is there a tutorial somewhere on how to build a custom filter that I could then load and use in ParaView? What about using it then in a Catalyst pipeline? What about making it parallel?

Thanks,

Hi Matthieu,

The ParaView Plugin HowTo page [1] is a helpful resource when learning how
to make ParaView plugins.

You can also take a look at the plugin examples under
ParaView/Examples/Plugins for some complete examples of plugins with custom
filters, readers, etc.

HTH,

This seems to be working fine for me. Any chance that you could share your

 Hello Kai,
? ?Now after doing a clean build of a recent ParaView master, it seems I can no longer see the Mitchel.stl file, and the server produces the error logs you have mentioned somewhere above about the being unable to read the reading point.? So I would say at this point, there is perhaps a bug in the stl reader.? I wonder if you would be willing to file a bug report?? Maybe two while you're at it?
1) stl file load issue, it would be great if you are able to upload a file that can be used to reproduce the issue, something you don't mind sharing.
2) surface with edges issue in ParaViewWeb when doing local rendering
We are still keeping track of bugs with Mantis for the time being:
http://www.paraview.org/Bug/my_view_page.php

Thanks!? Someone will get around to these when we get some time, but we probably can't estimate when that will be.

Dear Scott,
Should I just wait for the next patch release for the local rendering (WebGL)?"Surface with edges" issue??

I just tried the following commands to obtain the source from the GitLab and rebuilt the ParaViewWeb 4.4 with OSMesa, but it still does not resolve my stl loading issue. Am I still not getting latest 4.4 release with all the commits?.
git clone?https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview.git?srccd src ? ? ? ? ?git submodule update --init

On the other hand, I also tried to download and build from master .tar.gz file from the GitLab, but it seems not to have the latest?submodule. I got the following error message:
CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:625 (include):? ?include could not find load file:

?CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:626 (include):? ?include could not find load file:

?CMake Error at CMake/ParaViewMacros.cmake:416 (include):? ?include could not find load file:

I am not sure how to update to the latest?submodule since I did not use the git to clone the source.
Thank you again!

Dear Scott:
I do not have problems setting the representation to "Surface" with color "T" in local deprecated rendering mode. However, I do get the same error message with?representation set to ?"Surface with edges" or "Wireframe"?with color "T" in local deprecated rendering.?
But "Surface with edges" and "Wireframe"?with color "T" in remote rendering are fine.?

When I click "choose?palette" , select "Cool to Warm" and click apply properties for my cube data sample, it does not apply to the?geometry. One thing I have noticed is that it seems to have post backs twice because the drop-down menu selection goes from "Cool to Warm" to "choose platter" ?after I clicked apply properties. Could this be my sever response issue?


I think it probably is applying the color palette you choose to the geometry.? Think of the color palette as the starting point for your coloring scheme, and from there you can add and remove colors from the lookup table at will.? For this reason, we don't keep the value you choose for color palette in the drop-down box, because as soon as you adjust the lookup table, that palette name would no longer match the lookup table you're using.? Since the default color palette is "Cool to Warm", you don't notice any change when you choose that one again.? And since your data arrays have a numeric range of 0, you should just see blue.? If you change the color palette to "Red to Blue Rainbow", in your case, you will see the data become all red, though the color palette drop-down will not change.?
Also there is always ?latency between user inputs and?visualization. What I meant is that when users select and apply different properties to the?visualization, it seems to take awhile to apply those properties. For example, color management's representation and color selections. Could the latency be due to our ubuntu sever specifications?


Some latency is expected, but I guess the question is how much latency you are seeing when changing properties and applying them.? A second to a couple of seconds is normal to apply property changes, but it could vary with the data you are visualizing.?
Could you please provide me the latest master git HTTPS clone URL ? I can try and rebuild the ParaViewWeb 4.4 with OSMesa.?



We have moved to gitlab recently, and I don't think you should need an account or anything to access the repo there.? Try this url:
https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview.git

On the main gitlab page (https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview) you should find links to the new development workflow documentation which can guide you through the process.?
My new question is that if we would like to start ParaViewWeb with our own default ?view. For example, set the representation always to "Surface with edges", Set color always to "T" , set palette always to "Cool to Warm" and etc. Do we simply modify the HTML markup and possibly modify/add JavaScript to those files in www directory??. What would be the best way to handle this situation?


That is probably not the way I would go with it, but I think this is beyond the scope of normal mailing list support questions.? If you are interested in customizing the Web Visualizer for your own needs, you could consider a support contract.? See here for some information:

Hope this helps.
Cheers,Scott?
Sorry for all the questions. Thank you very much!

 Hello Kai,
? ?So in doing some more testing it seems, that the problem may actually be with the webgl exporter when you set the representation to "Surface with edges".? Can you try to see if you have the problem with just "Surface"?? In that case, there is potentially a bug in the geometry exporter.
? ?Regarding the stl file issue, I did follow the same steps to build ParaViewWeb which you provided (just using hardware rendering rather than OSMesa) and I see the same issue you described.? So in this case, it seems like maybe some commit since the 4.4 release has fixed an issue with the stl reader.? If you are able to get the latest master and build it, that could fix your stl loading problem.
Hope this helps.

Dear Scott:
Thank you for the testings.
?1) Regarding using local rendering on the cube data file: It seems that with local rendering, we may not properly handle coloring by arrays where the data range is 0 (e.g. the range of T in your case was?[303.1499938964844, 303.1499938964844]).? I was able to use local rendering by first loading the data, then choosing a local rendering approach (either worked fine), and then going back and coloring by T.? This could be a workaround if you need to test the speed of local rendering vs remote.

Kai's Response:
My?local deprecated (WebGL) rendering seems quite fast now when I load ParaView Datasets.?
I was not able to use local rendering (Local VGL or Local Deprecated) on my cube data file. I first loaded the data, chose local (Deprecated) option and then went back to color by T. I got the same error message: WebSocket connection to 'ws://XXXX:8080/proxy?sessionId=7bb6e67a-63a9-11e5-9b44-00155dd73e0d' failed: Error during WebSocket handshake: Unexpected response code: 503 . I believe the server side process indeed crashed. However, remote rendering does seem to work fine with T color. The speed of local rendering is very slow, but the speed of local deprecated (WebGL) rendering is very fast now.?


2) Regarding loading the .stl file, I did not run into the same issue as you did, i.e. the .stl file loaded without any problems.? The paraviewweb I am running was built from master which is a day or so old, so I'm wondering what version you may have compiled?
Kai's Response:

I tried .stl file a couple of times again and still the same. I do not see the geometry in ParaViewWeb, and the log file has the same error message as before. Currently my Ubuntu 14.04 has ParaViewWeb - 4.4 version. I built this on 09/22/2015. The following is the commands I used to obtain the source:
Get ParaViewWeb by a Specific Version
git clone git://paraview.org/ParaView.git srccd srcgit checkout v4.4.0git submodule update --init

When I build ParaViewWeb 4.3 in July, 2015, I used the following commands:

Get the latest ParaViewWeb source?
git clone git://paraview.org/stage/ParaView.git srccd src ? ? ? ? ?git submodule update --init


I have put my responses inline below again ....

Dear Scott,
Thanks for your quick response, I have also put my?responses inline below with light blue color :





Issue 1:?Loading ASCII stl file
When I try to load my ASCII stl file on the ParaviewWeb, I receive the following error message in my log file. However, desktop ParaView application loads the file fine.?
ERROR: In /home/user/ParaViewWeb/ParaView/src/VTK/IO/Geometry/vtkSTLReader.cxx, line 461vtkSTLReader (0x5d89b50): STLReader: error while reading file /home/user/ParaViewWeb/data/Mitchell_Lee_Administration_ReckordArmory_.stl at line 14: unable to read reading point.

Did you build the ParaView desktop application in the same build as the version you're using to run ParaViewWeb?? Maybe you could try to take one of the standard ParaView datasets and try to load it in ParaViewWeb, and see if you have the same issue you mentioned above.? To get this data if you don't already have it, go here:
http://www.paraview.org/download/

And under "Type of Download", choose "Data, Documentation, and Tutorials".? Once you get this data, try opening the "disk_out_ref.ex2" file in ParaViewWeb.? If you see the same issue as above, then there could be something going on with the way you have built ParaView, which we can try to figure out at that point.? If you do not see the same issue as above, then perhaps you could send me (off the list) a sample data file I could use to try to replicate the problem and debug it on this end.

Kai's Response?
I did not build the ParaView desktop application. I installed ParaView 4.1.0 through the Ubuntu terminal using ?sudo?apt-get?install?paraviewopenfoam410?.?
I tested files with?local?ParaView desktop application as well as local ParaViewWeb. My Ubuntu 14.04 server does not have ParaView application, and it has only ParaViewWeb. Both server and local ParaViewWeb produce the same issues.?
I have tested?"disk_out_ref.ex2" file in ParaViewWeb, and it seems to be okay. I will send you the sample data files privately.?

Just so I am clear.? Your "local" version is the one you install via apt-get?? And the Ubuntu 14.04 server version is the one you built yourself?? Did you download a source bundle to build the server one?? If so, do you know what version you downloaded and built on your server?
Kai's Response:

I apologize for the confusion. I built both my "local" and "sever" ParaViewWeb 4.4.0 with OSMesa using the following commands:
git clone git://paraview.org/ParaView.git srccd srcgit checkout v4.4.0git submodule update --init
I had to use git checkout v4.4.0 because last time the repository head was 4.3 version.?
My "local" ParaView 4.1 desktop application was installed via apt-get. When I said ParaView desktop application, I am not referring to the ParaViewWeb at all. I always refer ParaView and ParaViewWeb as two applications.?
Please note that I had also tried ParaViewWeb 4.1 and 4.3 on both my "local" and "server", they both had the same issues in loading the ASCII STL file and rendering the output fields, which would be the same issues currently I am experiencing in ParaViewWeb 4.4.
?


Issue 2:?
If I do the following selections on the ParaViewWeb, I always receive?src/VTK/Common/Core/vtkDataArrayTemplate.h:191: T vtkDataArrayTemplate<T>::GetValue(vtkIdType) [with T = float; vtkIdType = long long int]: Assertion `id >= 0 && id < this->Size' failed?message in the log file and cause the web socket connection closed. ?

I checked HTTP traffic, it has the following message. I assume the connection is closed because of the above error.?



I wonder if the server side process crashed as a result of the error you see in the log file?? That would explain the websocket connection error.? Again, trying a known data set like "disk_out_ref.ex2" may help us to pinpoint problem which caused the error output you saw above.

Kai's Response?
My?unintelligent question is how could I determine if the server side process crashed??



One approach: Use a terminal on the machine where ParaViewWeb is running and type:

ps -ef | grep pvpython
If the process is running, you should see a pvpython instance running, where your pv_web_visualizer.py script is the argument, along with any other arguments your launcher provided when it started the process for you.? Something like:
/path/to/paraview/build/bin/pvpython /path/to/paraview/build/lib/site-packages/paraview/web/pv_web_visualizer.py --port 9999 --data-dir /blah/blah/blah
In the case of the cube you shared with me, the process did indeed crash as a result of the steps you provided.
Kai's Response:

Thank you for the command and the explanations.

Issue 3: Slow ParaViewWeb
My ParaViewWeb is very slow. Even I change the rendering mode to WebGL, It is still very slow. The Ubuntu 14.04 Sever ?specifications are the following:
- 8 Cores?- 8 GB RAM??- 2.3 Ghz processors



To get faster rendering with OSMesa, you may try building a recent version of OSMesa using Gallium + LLVMPipe.? See here:
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/ParaView_And_Mesa_3D

But even that won't be as fast as hardware rendering (not using OSMesa).? I'm not sure why you don't see a speedup when switching to WebGL, though, for if your data is small enough to all fit in within the GPU of your desktop or laptop, then it should be faster than offscreen rendering on the server, once the data is loaded.
Kai's Response?

I believe my build?is based on??recent version of OSMesa using Gallium + LLVMPipe
Mesa 9.2.2 OSMesa Gallium llvmpipe

make -j4
autoreconf -fi
./configure \CXXFLAGS="-O2 -g -DDEFAULT_SOFTWARE_DEPTH_BITS=31"?\CFLAGS="-O2 -g -DDEFAULT_SOFTWARE_DEPTH_BITS=31"?\--disable-xvmc \--disable-glx \--disable-dri \--with-dri-drivers=""?\--with-gallium-drivers="swrast"?\--enable-texture-float?\--disable-shared-glapi \--disable-egl \--with-egl-platforms=""?\--enable-gallium-osmesa \--enable-gallium-llvm=yes \--with-llvm-shared-libs \--prefix=/opt/mesa/9.2.2/llvmpipe

make?-j2
make?-j4 install


This looks fine to me, though I believe OSMesa Gallium llvmpipe has moved along quite a few versions since that documentation was written, so building a more recent one could be something to try.?

When I built ParaViewWeb, The following is what I changed when I generated the cmake file:
PARAVIEW_ENABLE_PYTHON ?????ONPARAVIEW_BUILD_QT_GUI ??????OFFCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX ???????/.../ParaView/installVTK_USE_X ??????????????????OFFOPENGL_INCLUDE_DIR ?????????/opt/mesa/9.2.2/llvmpipe/includeOPENGL_gl_LIBRARYOPENGL_glu_LIBRARY ?????????/opt/mesa/9.2.2/llvmpipe/lib/libGLU.so

Jesse,

You could try the Ruler source in ParaView, then place the ends as you've
placed the ends of the red line in your image. This will give you the width.

To interpolate values along the line, you can use the Plot Over Line
filter. Again, place the end points of the lines as you did with the ruler
(you could even copy and past the Point1 and Point2 property values from
one to the other). Optionally, you could dispense with the Ruler source and
compute the length of the line in the Plot Over Line filter manually given
Point1 and Point2.

HTH,
Cory

Kai,

Thanks for filing these bug reports. I believe the STL load issue is
already fixed in ParaView's master branch, but the bug fix did not make it
into version 4.4.

Subject: [Paraview] Plotting only some blocks of a vtkMultiBlockDataSet
Message-ID: <37142D5FC373A846ACE4F75AA11EA84D21C04667@DITKA.anl.gov>

Hi,

I have a parallel, Catalyst-enabled simulation exposing its data using a vtkMultiBlockDataSet.
Each block in this dataset is a vtkRectilinearGrid.

Each of the n processes handles k blocks (same number of blocks in each process).
I used the sample script provided with ParaView to write an output of my adaptor so that I can then generate an actual visualization pipeline using ParaView with this output as source.

My question is: how can I ask ParaView to plot only one of the blocks (for debugging purpose; my mesh does not currently look like what it should and I suspect a problem in the way I compute the coordinates of each block's vertices, as a function of the process rank and block id).

Thanks,

Matthieu

Have you tried using the "Extract Block" filter? You can use that to
extract out the block of interest.

Hi Dennis,

The documentation that is available in the online help is generated at
build time from the sources/filters/readers that ship with ParaView. The
same is true for binary pluginsthat are built into a shared library.

Unfortunately documentation from purely XML plugins is not added to the
online help. It could be, but it would take some effort to implement.

The good news is that you *can* create a shared library plugin from a pure
XML filter. Just follow a couple steps in the ParaView Plugin HowTo,
specifically, sections [1] and [2].

Subject: [Paraview] Correctly Parallel Processing of OpenFoam results using
	pvserver
Message-ID: <CABW_nGLEV23NtJpFH+_oC79TSMZQLR066+39L2XtCe2Yh=gWqQ@mail.gmail.com>

I'm attempting to use pvserver to accelerate the post-processing of my
openfoam solution. I have a 48 core machine. I have correctly installed and
compiled a parallel copy of paraview 4.1.0 with OpenFOAM 2.4.x. If I open a
simple .obj file I can see that different parts of the surface are rendered
using different processors. I can also see that the memory is shared among
the parallel processes.

When I open a reconstructed openFOAM solution with 20 million cells with
paraview connected to 40 process pvserver, the image seems to be rendered
(or processed) with only 1 processor. Is there a step that I'm missing to
parallelize the reconstructed Openfoam data files for rendering?

As I recall, reconstructed means that the root node does all the work.
Switch to decomposed type in the reader and let us know how it works then.

Have you tried using the "Extract Block" filter? You can use that to
extract out the block of interest.

Looping the list back in to the thread.

Look on the properties panel when you open the file and before you hit
"Apply" look for a chooser for "Case Type". The default is "Reconstructed
Case" so change it to "Decomposed Case".

David,

   I do not have a chooser for "case type".  I found a web page that shows
the "case type" chooser.  They were opening a .foam file.  I have .OpenFOAM
case.

   Should I consider converting the foam to VTK?

Hi again,

I'm getting closer to making my sample application work, but still have some problems:

I have checked that my C++ adaptors are correct by generating a script that writes the data in pvti files. This works, I can run my application with this script, the file is generated and I can load it in ParaView to see that the content is correct. I took this opportunity to re-generate a script that is supposed to output a PNG file.

Now the generation of the PNG file has some problem. I attach a screenshot of what the source data looks like in ParaView (and thus what should be output by Catalyst in a PNG file).

- If I run the application from the VM's graphical interface, it runs fine. It only gives me the OpenGL warning I mentioned before. BUT the generated file has a big black area (see image_2.png attached). Also I see a window appear for a brief moment with the correct (full) view, then it disappears. I don't know why I get that.

- If I connect to the VM through SSH with -X (otherwise I get the bad display error) and run the application, Catalyst also outputs an image, but this image also has an artifact (see image_1.png attached), and then the application crashes in a segfault, outputing a backtrace (*** glibc detected *** ./Mandelbulb: munmap_chunk(): invalid pointer: 0x00007faffb503010 ***).
In the backtrace, the first line (so the last function call) is this:
/home/mdorier/ParaView-build/lib/libvtkCommonCore-pv4.4.so.1(_ZN20vtkDataArrayTemplateIhE11DeleteArrayEv+0x4b)[0x7fb028c257fd]

I attach my code for reproducibility.

Thanks for your help!

Matthieu

Hi,

Indeed, disabling 3D acceleration makes ParaView work. I initially enabled it because when it's off, my Catalyst script gives me this:

OpenGL Warning: Failed to connect to host. Make sure 3D acceleration is enabled for this VM.

and the PNG image resulting from my script is just white (now that may be unrelated, maybe there is just a problem with my Catalyst adaptors...)

Also when running the simulation, I see a white-filled window briefly appearing an disappearing before this message shows up. This also happens when I run it through SSH (but I have to use the -X option in SSH, otherwise I get another error saying "bac X server connection").

Thank,

Matthieu

What Cory suggested may be it. I can't spot anything fishy in the
CMakeCache.txt. Also try running another OpenGL enabled app, eg.
glxgears to see if that works. I believe it's provided by the
`mesa-utils` package on Ubuntu.

Subject: [Paraview] Measuring a specific contour line generated in Paraview
	with Line object?
Message-ID: <A32163F2-E46D-41C2-BD63-7C91198FE7E0@udel.edu>

Greetings Paraview community -


Referring to the attached image, I have these alternating white/blueish lines that are the result of having the imaginary field of the B-field =0, and then taking the log of the absolute value of that quantity. There called ?null lines? since that quantity is,n well, null.

 Here?s my question though. Is there anyway for Paraview to give a value for the width of these null lines shown in the image (red line artificially inserted for now)? Is it through the line object?

 One more question - where I have the red line is where I?d like to read off the values. I have other vtk files where the width will change. Is there a way to define this line such that the values change with the width?

Thanks!
 Jesse
