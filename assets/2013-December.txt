Ken et. al.,

  Ok - contour is attached, but not too sure on it, since the contour (in this case) represents the E-field (real) in the x direction, where the slice was the B (or magnetic) (imag) field in the z-direction. The change in intensity I'd like to see is the B-imag in the z-direction as I move the slice up and down (as per the last email).

   Is there any way to take a screen shot of Paraview itself and add it to this discussion? I've seen other people do it, but I don't know how.

   Also, maybe I can send a movie to show what I am after? How would I do that as well?

   Thanks!
    Jesse

Hi Burlen,

Your example was really helpful to understand many thing about the xml
format and I want to thank you about that, but I still have some questions.

1. What the numbers 0 4 8 12 (line 24) represent?
2. What the QuadratureWeights are all zero (line 37)?
3. In your example there are 4 cells with 4 Gauss points in each cell. In
total 16 Gauss points. If I want to assign to each Gauss point one value of
stress or strain how I have to write those 16 values in xml format. Can you
please sent me an example with this information?

Thank you very much

Marios

Subject: [Paraview] RegionIDs cannot be 0 while using Catalyst
Message-ID: <2013120215025078507115@sccas.cn>

Hi, all

When using Catalyst for Live Data Visualization, I get an error for each frame as follows,

ERROR: In /path/to/paraview-4.0.0-RC2/source/directory/ParaViewCore/VTKExtensions/Rendering/vtkKdTreeGenerator.cxx, line 172
vtkKdTreeGenerator (0x71c3dc0) : RegionIDs cannot be 0.

Both the paraview and the simulation processer are not crash and get four sub-images with four processors, but sub images are not composited as what I've expected.
The whole volume is of size (nx*2, ny*2, nz), and devide into four sub volumes. When creating the volume data, I use the following piece of code to set the grid, where nx, ny, nz are the size of current sub volume, and nxstart, nystart, nzstart are the starting grid of current sub volume. 

 33   vtkSmartPointer<vtkImageData> grid = vtkSmartPointer<vtkImageData>::New();
 34 
 35   grid->SetExtent(*nxstart, *nxstart+*nx-1, *nystart, *nystart+*ny-1, *nzstart, *nzstart+*nz-1);
 36 
 37   // Name should be consistent between here, Fortran and Python client script.
 38   vtkCPPythonAdaptorAPI::GetCoProcessorData()->GetInputDescriptionByName("input")->SetGrid(grid);
 39   vtkCPPythonAdaptorAPI::GetCoProcessorData()->GetInputDescriptionByName("input")->SetWholeExtent(0, *nx*2-1, 0, *ny*2-1, 0, *nz-1);

So I think I may lost some key steps to specify the proper kdtree region ids, but I havn't found out how to configure it.

Any ideas? Thanks in advance.

Subject: [Paraview] ParaviewWeb 4 - WebGL renderer camera reset and
	background issue
Message-ID: <529C5825.2050701@simscale.de>

Hello all,

I have run into a couple of issues while using the WebGL renderer in
ParaviewWeb 4. Could you help me out with some pointers or possible
workarounds for these problems.

1. Camera View being reset
The camera orientation and position are always being reset after
performing different operations, such as:
-Activating/De-activating the scalarbar
-Choosing between point/face data for the ColorBy selection
-Adding a filter into the current pipeline
-Rescaling
-advancing to the next file/time-step in the Data Source.

2. Background other than black
This happens when a background of a different colour, for example a
gradient of white and grey is chosen. If I alter the camera position or
orientation, this background (which is in this case represented by a
rectangle with the selected colours) can move out of the field-of view,
it does not stay in a fixed position relative to the camera meaning the
black regular background is in most part visible.

Both issues happen only when using the WebGL renderer. When switching to
the software renderer, the behaviour is as expected.

Kind Regards,
Bogdan

Hi all,


I'm trying to filter data with the Python Calculator.
When activating Multi-Core, inputs[0].PointData[name_of_value] returns
wrong value.
For example, generated Ids as 0 to (n - 1) are converted into
0 to (n - 1) * 2 ^ 32.

How can I solve the problem?

The Live Data Visualization is still beta functionality. It looks like
you're not specifying the extents properly somehow. I'd suggest writing out
the full grid to see what that looks like.

Many thanks for the insight, Ken. Yes, we used transparency of 0.23 to render the channel wall transparent so that we can see how vorticity flows pass through the wall. Looks like data redistribution for visibility reordering for transparency effect was to blame for the performance overhead. We also rendered three views (top, side, and front) for each time point with transparent walls in each view, which also contributes to the performance overhead. We are also planning to move vorticity computation to the solver from ParaView, which should help alleviate coprocessing tax a little bit.

We will see whether we can get by without rendering transparent walls. In the meantime, let me know if you have any suggestions to work around the data redistribution part for rendering transparent surfaces.

Thanks again and best regards,

Hong

I also wonder if you are trying to render anything transparent (volume rendering, opacity < 1, or transparency in the color bars). If you do that, then ParaView will redistribute the data to create a visibility reordering. Although the rendering itself has been scaled past 18K cores, the data redistribution (using the D3 filter) has not. In fact, I would not be super surprised that it could take that long even with very little data.

In short, try rendering only opaque surfaces if you have not yet tried that.

Hi Hong,

This doesn't make a lot of sense. Image compositing performance is not strongly tied to the number of polygons. It is much more related to the number of cores and the image size. So 64K cores with small data should not perform so much better than 18K cores with large data. Since Ice-T takes bounding boxes into account when compositing, there may be performance gains when rendering less geometry but not to the extent that you are describing.

On the other hand, I can see Mesa rendering performance being an issue. The 18K run probably has significantly more polygons per MPI rank, specially if the polygons are not distributed somewhat evenly. This is definitely worthwhile investigating. Do you have cycles to run a few more cases? We can instrument things a bit better to see what is taking this much time.

Hi Berk,

Many thanks for the helpful information and the interesting paper. Yes, we used transparency to render the channel walls (see details in the email I just sent out) overlaid with vorticity flows. I'd love to run some tests with more instrumentation to figure out the bottleneck. It'd be great if you could give me some pointers on this such as some instrumentation tools I could leverage, etc.

Best regards,

Hong

Subject: Re: [Paraview] In-situ file/image output on Titan with 18k cores

Someone just pointed out that I read Hong's original e-mail wrong. I read 64 as 64K. Sorry about that. There are still some questions about which part of rendering not scaling, which we are investigating off-list. We still need:

- to know if transparency is involved because D3 most likely won't scale
- if we can run some tests with more instrumentation to figure out the bottleneck

Check out this paper:

http://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~pang/visweek/2013/ldav/papers/larendea.pdf

The EDF folks were getting pretty decent scalability up to 3.6K cores even with D3 redistribution of the entire unstructured grid. However, 18K is significantly larger so it is very likely that something will break...

Best,
-berk

This doesn't make a lot of sense. Image compositing performance is not strongly tied to the number of polygons. It is much more related to the number of cores and the image size. So 64K cores with small data should not perform so much better than 18K cores with large data. Since Ice-T takes bounding boxes into account when compositing, there may be performance gains when rendering less geometry but not to the extent that you are describing.

On the other hand, I can see Mesa rendering performance being an issue. The 18K run probably has significantly more polygons per MPI rank, specially if the polygons are not distributed somewhat evenly. This is definitely worthwhile investigating. Do you have cycles to run a few more cases? We can instrument things a bit better to see what is taking this much time.

Hi Bogdan,

To fix the issue #1, you just need to add a property at the construction of
the viewport in order to keep client and server in synch.
I don't remember the key/value pair but if you look inside the
xxx.webgl.js, you should find out.
Moreover, once the JS documentation get regenerated after the next
gatekeeper review, this will be well described.

For the #2, this is definitely a new bug that will need to be addressed.

Thanks for your feedback,

Seb

Hi Bogdan,
I want to use WebGl with paraviewWeb 4 and JettySessionManager. So far I am
using the PV binary and have defined my own protocol that works fine. At
which places in the setup do you have to do alterations to get webgl
rendering running ? Where can I get more information on that ?

Many thanks,

Kyr

Hi Kyr,

The way I am doing that is by switching the renderer for the viewport in
the javascript code I use on the client-side with:

pv.viewport.setActiveRenderer("webgl");

It might however not be enough, as it turns out. My camera orientation
keeps resetting, but that I will describe that in my next post.

Kind Regards,

Hi Seb,

I have located the file and key where the value should, I assume, be set
on the web deployment: vtkweb-all.js.

The key value combination seem to be in:
DEFAULT_OPTIONS = {
        keepServerInSynch: true
}

which I have set to true. In the web-browser, after deleting the cache,
I can see this is the current key-value combination, however
synchronisation is not completed. I tried placing the key-value in
quotes as well, without any effect.

I am switching the WebGL renderer on with
pv.viewport.setActiveRenderer("webgl");

Should this be enough or I am still missing some configuration values?

The vtkweb.viewport.webgl.js itself is in the ParaView sources under:
src/VTK/Web/JavaScript/Lib/vtkweb.viewport.webgl.js, but its contents is
also in vtkweb-all.js, which is deployed for the web-app as well as in
the different examples.

Kind Regards,
Bogdan

Hum,

that should work then.
I've fixed it a week or 2 ago. Are you using the latest ParaView/master
from git?

Ah, that should be it. Mine is around 3-4 weeks old. I will recompile it
in its entirety, but as a starting point for this particular isue, what
needs to be recompiled, or is it just the javascripts that need to be
updated?

You can probably download any nightly binary and just get the new "www"
directory with the python code vtk/web/* + paraview/web/*.
That might just work. ;-)

Subject: [Paraview] Volumetric slice with transparency?
In-Reply-To: <5AA68457-F310-4F40-AEBF-341020EC4F7A@udel.edu>
Message-ID: <CEC1DECB.12EAA%kmorel@sandia.gov>

If you want to see the imaginary magnetic field in the z direction, then try taking a contour of that.

You could also try taking a slice along the length of the model. That would give you a nice cross section of the field, which could tell you a lot, particularly if you have a lot of symmetry in your data.

There is no internal function in ParaView to take a screen shot of the entire GUI. The pictures you see posted are taken with some external screen grab functionality. On Windows you can do this by pressing Alt+Print Screen (copies to clipboard). On Mac you can do this by pressing command+shift+3 or command+shift+4 (saves to desktop). There are also numerous third-party utilities to grab the screen. That said, I'm not sure what you are intending to accomplish by capturing the entire GUI instead of just using ParaView's save screenshot function. It really only helps to show some information about the state of ParaView, and it's not particularly good at that.

Once again, to make an animation of the entire GUI, you need a third party utility. If you happen to have one, it could simplify making an animation. If not, you could establish an animation within ParaView and use the save animation function. The ParaView Tutorial (http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/The_ParaView_Tutorial) has instructions on setting up animations in ParaView.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] Re: [Paraview] Volumetric slice with transparency?

Ken et. al.,

  Ok - contour is attached, but not too sure on it, since the contour (in this case) represents the E-field (real) in the x direction, where the slice was the B (or magnetic) (imag) field in the z-direction. The change in intensity I'd like to see is the B-imag in the z-direction as I move the slice up and down (as per the last email).

   Is there any way to take a screen shot of Paraview itself and add it to this discussion? I've seen other people do it, but I don't know how.

   Also, maybe I can send a movie to show what I am after? How would I do that as well?

   Thanks!

Have you tried the contour filter? Based on your screenshots I would expect that to give you a variable width cylinder along the z axis showing the behavior everywhere at once.

So, everyone sees the slice, right? When I move up and down the z-axis with the slice, I see the field change especially towards the center. I also played with "box" in the slice type option.

I was wondering the best way to show the field change as I slide the slice. Would clip still show it? Also, is there a way to show you my Paraview screen? Let me know so I can show you exactly what's going on.

As with many things in ParaView, there are lots of ways to do what you are
asking, each with a slightly different behavior. I'll list through the
ones I can think of.

* Like Utkarsh said, if your data is structured, you can use the "Extract
Subset" filter. This will be the most efficient option, but the UI will be
pretty crummy.

* Also like Utkarsh said, you can use a pair of clip filters (instead of
slice) to grab a reason. Use the Inside Out option on one of the clip
filters so that the intersection of the half spaces become a slab.

* You can change the Clip Type of the clip to a Box region. This will
allow you clip a slab in one operation. The disadvantage is that the box
clip operation can introduce more artifacts than a Plane clip. Also, you
need to make sure the clip is Inside Out.

* You should also try the Extract Cells By Region filter in place of the
clip filter. Rather than cutting up cells, it will keep full cells that
intersect a region you specify. Like Clip, Extract Cells By Region allows
you to define cells by planes and boxes (although the inside/outside
semantics are reversed). I suspect the Extract Cells By Region filter with
a Box intersection will be the closest to what you want.

Utkarsh,

 Thanks for the response. By volumetric slice - see how the slice is
now?
Isn't there a way to make it thicker and move it up and down to show the
changes?  What about the "clip" option?

 Thanks!

I am not sure what you mean by volumetric slice. Does it mean multiple

"Slice"
filter does allow specifying additional offsets to slice. Switch the
Properties panel to show advanced properties

the
"search box" at the top of the Properties panel. Now you can add offsets

Ok Ken, let me try out the contour of that. And thanks for the screen shot advice - I just didn't know if "screen shot" in Paraview captured everything on the screen or just the rendering. Hence that question.

Ok, let me try this out and I'll get back to you.

Thanks!

Ken,


I'm not too sure how to do a slice for the length of the model (perhaps something in the value range???). Do you mean a slice "box" like this (see pic)?

If that's what you mean, is there anyway to make the purple color less opaque without sacrificing on the intensity part?

I'd be interested to know if your simulation uses a Yin-Yan grid configuration and if you have a native reader for it, or if you are using a different grid setup, maybe icosahedron, or tetrahedron, etc...

I have worked with scientists doing similar simulations of mantle convection with the YinYan grids and don't have a full native support yet, requiring grid clipping and grid stiching.

nice work!

No, I simply mean to change the orientation of the slice plane. For example, hit the "Y Normal" button in the properties panel for the slice filter.

You can also try the slice view. Hit the x button in the upper left corner of the view, then click the Slice View button. A video on using the slice view is here: http://vimeo.com/50316342

Ken,


I'm not too sure how to do a slice for the length of the model (perhaps something in the value range???). Do you mean a slice "box" like this (see pic)?

If that's what you mean, is there anyway to make the purple color less opaque without sacrificing on the intensity part?

If you want to see the imaginary magnetic field in the z direction, then try taking a contour of that.

You could also try taking a slice along the length of the model. That would give you a nice cross section of the field, which could tell you a lot, particularly if you have a lot of symmetry in your data.

There is no internal function in ParaView to take a screen shot of the entire GUI. The pictures you see posted are taken with some external screen grab functionality. On Windows you can do this by pressing Alt+Print Screen (copies to clipboard). On Mac you can do this by pressing command+shift+3 or command+shift+4 (saves to desktop). There are also numerous third-party utilities to grab the screen. That said, I'm not sure what you are intending to accomplish by capturing the entire GUI instead of just using ParaView's save screenshot function. It really only helps to show some information about the state of ParaView, and it's not particularly good at that.

Once again, to make an animation of the entire GUI, you need a third party utility. If you happen to have one, it could simplify making an animation. If not, you could establish an animation within ParaView and use the save animation function. The ParaView Tutorial (http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/The_ParaView_Tutorial) has instructions on setting up animations in ParaView.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] Re: [Paraview] Volumetric slice with transparency?

Ken et. al.,

  Ok - contour is attached, but not too sure on it, since the contour (in this case) represents the E-field (real) in the x direction, where the slice was the B (or magnetic) (imag) field in the z-direction. The change in intensity I'd like to see is the B-imag in the z-direction as I move the slice up and down (as per the last email).

   Is there any way to take a screen shot of Paraview itself and add it to this discussion? I've seen other people do it, but I don't know how.

   Also, maybe I can send a movie to show what I am after? How would I do that as well?

   Thanks!

Subject: [Paraview] Problem with saving data along stream trace in parallel
Message-ID: <CAHunYyhbmiYmavOTYcngtoCS74WaLLjCZg6QD+f4apspmMfaGw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I'm trying to extract data along a streamline. I have a script that works
fine in serial, but gives errors in parallel. I get the same errors if I
use the GUI or if I run the script with pvbatch, so I don't think it's a
problem with the script. The errors I get are:

ERROR: In /nv/hp25/bcolcord3/ParaView/VTK/Common/Core/vtkDataArray.cxx,
line 474
vtkDoubleArray (0xd4058a00): The number of components do not match the
number requested: 3 != 1

Warning: In /nv/hp25/bcolcord3/ParaView/VTK/Common/DataModel/vtkTable.cxx,
line 421
vtkTable (0xd4634a60): Cannot assign this variant type to multi-component
data array.

These errors occur when I do "writer.UpdatePipeline()" in the script, or
"Save Data" in the GUI. Output is still produced, but the attached images
show the problem. The streamline co-ordinates are OK, but the density along
the streamline is not.

I'm using ParaView 4.01, commit 8bab4fd99bda5b0b8748. My dataset is
Multi-block, and I apply the following filters before attempting writing:

CellDatatoPointData
ProgrammableFilter (to remove ghost layers)
Calculator (to create velocity vector from components)
StreamTracer

As you can see, it's a very simple task, but I can't get it to work in
parallel. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you.

Subject: [Paraview] Delaunay2D
Message-ID: <SNT150-W852E3B38D1E67B8571E66DEDD50@phx.gbl>

Hi All:
I have a problem with Delaunay2D filter projection plane. I have a 3D data of tumor, and I want to apply the Delaunay2D filter to three slices of the 3D data. Each slice will be in one plane. For the slice lying in XY plane everything is good (as the projection plane of the Delaunay filter is XY by default). However, for the other planes Delauany2D only returns a set of dots and not a surface. 
Changing to choose best fit for projection plane does not help. One solution that I have found is to first rotate that plane into XY, do the delaunay transform and then rotate back, but does any body have a better solution? Am I doing something wrong?
Thanks,

The point data arrays are probably ordered differently on separate blocks
or there are different point data arrays on different blocks. My suggestion
is to use a python programmable filter to remove the unneeded arrays or to
reorder them.

Maybe I misunderstand, but if the problem was because of point data arrays

Subject: [Paraview] Problem of migration from Paraview 3.98.1 to 4.1.0
Message-ID: <E70FE8EA6EBE9241BDB4CA6D8D12E1D801C245213E2B@RZJC1EX.jr1.local>

Hi,

I successfully compiled Paraview 4.1.0 with qt 4.8.1 on Win32 in VisualStudio 2008 and want to migrate my plugins to new structure.

I have the problem that the qt help of my reader fails to compile, on debugging I found out that the qhelpgenerator.exe command fails to generate the qch file from the qhp file, this is my output:

5>Compiling Qt help project GPCXReader.qhp
5>QSqlDatabase: QSQLITE driver not loaded
5>QSqlDatabase: available drivers:
5>Building up file structure...
5>Cannot open data base file E:/Develop/win32-msvc90-build/impropp/Applications/ParaviewPlugins/GPCXReader/doc/GPCXReader.qch!

Do I need the qsqlite plugin from qt? Procedure worked on paraview 3.98.1 with same qt lib.

Here is my generated GPCXReader.qhp file which is the input of the command:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

> 1. What the numbers 0 4 8 12 (line 24) represent?
This is the offset array used by VTK for random access into data on the 
quadrature points data. To generate it you go cell by cell and 
accumulate the number of quadrature points used by each cell. The next 
cell's data offset is the sum of the previous cell's number of 
quadrature points.

note that the documentation says that each array has a quadrature scheme 
dictionary, but this changed. the dictionaries are stored in the offeset 
array. we did this so that you only need to define one quadrature scheme 
dictionary for many arrays.

> 2. What the QuadratureWeights are all zero (line 37)?
Those aren't currently used in VTK but we have a place holder for them 
in case they are needed in user developed custom filters or later in VTK.

in my example you would read this file into PV and apply "interpolate to 
quadrature points" and then "generate quadrature points".

You're asking about writing the data on the Gauss points into the file. 
You have to store them in VTK FieldData and add an information key to 
each array that names the offset array. You have to order them correctly 
according to the offsets array and quadrature scheme. for example the 
pdf I sent before shows how each cell's quadrature points are ordered 
for one scheme. you won't write the points themselves, just the data values.

the T FieldData array in the following file is an example of containing 
scalar values at quadrature points (watch out there's also a PointData 
array named T that stores the nodal values), 
http://www.hpcvis.com/vis/images/vtk-quadrature-points-example/quadrature-points-example-2.vtu

after reading such a file into PV, you could see the arrays in the 
spreadsheet view but to see them in the 2d/3d view you'll need to apply 
the "generate quadrature points" filter to produce the point set and 
transfer the data onto it.

We use completely irregular grids that may be regular, so we use 
icosahedral grids too.

Our grid reader plugin provides PV with the tetrahedra from the grid 
file so no extra Delaunay has to be done.

Hi,

I successfully compiled Paraview 4.1.0 with qt 4.8.1 on Win32 in VisualStudio 2008 and want to migrate my plugins to new structure.

I have the problem that the qt help of my reader fails to compile, on debugging I found out that the qhelpgenerator.exe command fails to generate the qch file from the qhp file, this is my output:

5>Compiling Qt help project GPCXReader.qhp

5>Building up file structure...
5>Cannot open data base file E:/Develop/win32-msvc90-build/impropp/Applications/ParaviewPlugins/GPCXReader/doc/GPCXReader.qch!

Do I need the qsqlite plugin from qt? Procedure worked on paraview 3.98.1 with same qt lib.

Here is my generated GPCXReader.qhp file which is the input of the command:

And my CMake call:

ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN(GPCXReader "1.0"

Any suggestion?

Thanks for help,

Hi Seb,

Unfortunately just replacing these two directories does not work. The
logs do not offer me any clue either. It could be that the changes have
made my web-app incompatible with the current one? Have there been
changes to to the javascript files in the example projects as well?

I have also recompiled paraview, just in case, but still does not work
with my app. By the way, I am unable to find the OSMesa options, as well
as the PARAVIEW_ENABLE_WEB in ccmake. Have they been deprecated?


Kind Regards,
Bogdan

Subject: [Paraview] Session Manager with Apache front-end - session.map

Message-ID: <529DEA21.7080401@simscale.de>

Hi Seb,

A follow-up on this. The session map file is created and it is written
correctly, so I can say the original issue is solved. However I am still
having some problems with the rest of the setup for the following scenario:

-Apache Front-end serving a page through an SSL secured connection on
port 443.
-Jetty session manager working on the server on ports 9000-9100 (which
are of course not encrypted, but are behind the apache front-end).
-The session url is specifiend in the default-config.properties file as:
pw.factory.session.url.generator.pattern=ws://mydomain:443/proxy?sessionId=SESSION_ID

This does not work, though. There is no reaction on the browser and no
visible error message in the server logs. Changing to wss, yields a
connection which is closed instantly.

If however generate the sessionURL on port 9000 (unencrypted) the remote
browser-based paraview session works with most browsers, except Firefox,
which gives a security error due to the https-ws(unsecured socket)
combination.

My assumption is that with the Apache front-end all traffic would be
channelled through port 443 and the session manager would interact only
with it, not with the browser directly.

Thanks again for the kind replies!
Bogdan

Hi Bogdan,

I guess so, I've done quite some change lately. Specially regarding the
file listing management.

For the PARAVIEW_ENABLE_WEB, it is automatically set to ON is Python
wrapping is ON.
Otherwise the OSMesa one, should still be there but certainly in
the advanced section.
You can check on the ParaView wiki for more info, on how to compile
ParaView with OSMesa.

Thanks Seb. Yes, you are right it is in the advanced tab, the OSMesa

activate them.

Thanks!

Apache 2.2 and I have been using the first method so far, combined with
the mapping file configuration from the second link.

Are there any known issues with 2.2? Just to make sure I am not
understanding wrong, in the end, all traffic should go through the
apache port, right?

Thanks!

It may be that in serial it traverses the blocks in a separate order or
that the order the point data arrays are added are different in parallel.
An easy check would be to write out the multiblock in parallel before the
streamline filter is used and look at the outputted dataset files. I
believe the point data is written in the order it is traversed in the
vtkPointData container.

Message-ID: <CAE=GJrYrbd1XkVjLzFM2CHx+NG9Ne18m0G3JJPtBeh_5SEXAcQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am on windows, paraview 4.0.1

I've been trying to use two monitors to see my animations

Both of then connects to the same graphic card, each one of the monitors
has their own entry in the graphic card

They are side by side

Should i use -tdx=2 and -tdy=1?  When i do that i get 2 windows
 superposed, in the same monitor and i can't move them, they are both green
and i get the message error

Generic Warning: In
C:\DBD\pvs-x64\paraview\src\paraview\VTK\Rendering\Parallel\vtkSynchronizedRenderers.cxx,
line 751

failed after PushToFrameBuffer 1 OpenGL errors detected

0 : (1281) Invalid value

Using a .pvx i get the same 2 windows superposed, in the same monitor, i
cant move then too, (even when they have borders) but i do not get any
errors and i can see the data

I've tried multiclients, but how can i use different eye angles with this
approach?

And duplicating the image from one monitor to another doesnt help too


Can someone help me?

Classification: UNCLASSIFIED
Caveats: NONE

I've built 4.1.0 on a couple of our HPC systems and I'm getting a clean
build, but fails on execution of parallel servers.   On both systems (an SGI
Altix/ICE and an IBM iDataPlex) I'm using gcc and openmpi  and the same
exact build environment that I used to build 4.0.1.   However, both systems
are failing with identical errors that begins with a "Leave Pinned" mpi
feature which is a flag set in our mpirun command environment and works with
4.0.1. Did something change behind that scenes in ParaView 4.1.0 that
impacts the build or runtime parameters?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
A process attempted to use the "leave pinned" MPI feature, but no
memory registration hooks were found on the system at run time.  This
may be the result of running on a system that does not support memory
hooks or having some other software subvert Open MPI's use of the
memory hooks.  You can disable Open MPI's use of memory hooks by
setting both the mpi_leave_pinned and mpi_leave_pinned_pipeline MCA
parameters to 0.

Open MPI will disable any transports that are attempting to use the
leave pinned functionality; your job may still run, but may fall back
to a slower network transport (such as TCP).

job.

  Local host: xxx-n0221

At least one pair of MPI processes are unable to reach each other for
MPI communications.  This means that no Open MPI device has indicated
that it can be used to communicate between these processes.  This is
an error; Open MPI requires that all MPI processes be able to reach
each other.  This error can sometimes be the result of forgetting to
specify the "self" BTL.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
MPI_INIT has failed because at least one MPI process is unreachable
from another.  This *usually* means that an underlying communication
plugin -- such as a BTL or an MTL -- has either not loaded or not
allowed itself to be used.  Your MPI job will now abort.

You may wish to try to narrow down the problem;

 * Check the output of ompi_info to see which BTL/MTL plugins are
   available.
 * Run your application with MPI_THREAD_SINGLE.
 * Set the MCA parameter btl_base_verbose to 100 (or mtl_base_verbose,
   if using MTL-based communications) to see exactly which
   communication plugins were considered and/or discarded.

An MPI process is aborting at a time when it cannot guarantee that all

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
orterun has exited due to process rank 2 with PID 1198 on
node pershing-n0221 exiting improperly. There are two reasons this could
occur:

1. this process did not call "init" before exiting, but others in
the job did. This can cause a job to hang indefinitely while it waits
for all processes to call "init". By rule, if one process calls "init",
then ALL processes must call "init" prior to termination.

2. this process called "init", but exited without calling "finalize".
By rule, all processes that call "init" MUST call "finalize" prior to

Hi Sebastian,

I have switched to Apache-2.4.7 and used the second configuration, as
you recommended. It works now exactly as expected.

Thanks for the help!

Subject: [Paraview] ParaViewWeb - warpbyVector filter missing
Message-ID: <529E3BA1.4070008@simscale.de>

Hi all,

I believe the warpbyVector filter is missing from ParaViewWeb in
protocols.py:
lib/paraview-4.0/site-packages/paraview/web/protocols.py
and
lib/paraview-4.1/site-packages/paraview/web/protocols.py

Adding
{
   'name': 'WarpByVector',
   'icon': 'filter',
   'category': 'filter'
}

To the list in listFilters method in protocols.py is all what is needed
to make it expose it to the browsers.

Was there perhaps a reason not to have it included?

Kind regards,
Bogdan

I figured it  out. What I need is

GUI_SOURCES
   ${UI_BUILT_SOURCES}

in ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN().

However instead modifying the transfer function, what I actually what to do
is editing the Scalar to Color map. I have

pqDataRepresentation* repr =
pqActiveObjects::instance().activeRepresentation();

vtkColorTransferFunction *ctf =
vtkColorTransferFunction::SafeDownCast(repr->getLookupTable()->getProxy()->GetClientSideObject());
ctf->AddRGBPoint(10, 0, 0, 0);
ctf->AddRGBPoint(100, 0, 0, 0);

in my plugin's constructor, but when I open the transfer function editor
after applying the plugin, there's no new point in the color map. There are
just the two default color points. Am I missing something?

Hi,
I have a user that is trying to delete all of the entries in the pipeline browser, in a python script.  I tried using the trace recorder, and that didn't work.  Does anyone have any idea what command would do this?

Thanks,

Alan

Sorry to catch up so late but the possible reason why it was not working
before was the file generated does not have the same format.

The only reason was to only expose a subset of filters, while we were
trying the dynamic generation of the UI.
Ideally we should be able to expose any filter that ParaView support.
But nobody spent enough time to list all the filters that should and should
not be exposed.

So no reason to not expose it.

Seb

PS: If you expose more of them and find out they work just fine, just send
me the diff, and I'll do the change in the main repo.

Hmm, I'm not sure this is the proper way to do it since I get a warning but
it appears to work:
a = GetActiveSource() # requires a leaf of the pipeline tree to be selected
Delete(a)

The warning I get is:
ERROR: In
C:\DBD\pvs-x64\paraview\src\paraview\ParaViewCore\ServerManager\Core\vtkSMProxyListDomain.cxx,
line 189

vtkSMProxyListDomain (0000000012E46ED0): Index 2 greater than max 1


Somewhere in the Python API there's a method to get the filter proxy by
name but I don't remember that off the top of my head. If this doesn't work
for you, Utkarsh probably has a better way :)

Joe,

In ParaView, one rarely directly changes the underlying VTK objects,
instead uses the Proxy API. You should stick with updating the
"RGBPoints" property on the lookup table proxy
(repr->getLookupTable()->getProxy()).

e.g.

vtkSMProxy* lutProxy = repr->getLookupTable()->getProxy();
helper(lutProxy, "RGBPoints");
double rgbPoints = {10, 0, 0, 0,
                             100, 0, 0, 0};
vtkSMPropertyHelper(lutProxy, "RGBPoints").Set(rgbPoints, 8);
lutProxy->UpdateVTKObjects();

I can't think of anything in particular that changed that could affect
this. Are you trying this with pvserver? Can you try pvbatch? Same
problem?

Ah, one thing to try - and I bet this isn't it.  If your issue is with a paraview-pvserver remote server run, get rid of your client side .config files.  I have seen times that as we try different development versions, the .config files get messed up.  Grasping at straws here, but ...  Those config files are found in ~/.config/ParaView.

You should indeed be using this (if I understand what you're trying to
do). You;d need another machine for the client in that case. Also you
need to set display environment for each pvserver process such that it
uses the correct monitor (assuming you're on Linux). Refer to
http://paraview.org/Wiki/Setting_up_a_ParaView_Server#Using_a_Tiled_Display

Yes:

   import paraview
   import paraview.servermanager

    pm = paraview.servermanager.vtkProcessModule.GetProcessModule()
    type = pm.GetProcessTypeAsInt()

for Python console and pvpython, the type will be pm.PROCESS_CLIENT
for pvbatch it will be pm.PROCESS_BATCH

To determine if it's Python console or pvpython, you can check

    paraview.fromGUI

Peter,

You may want to use Python Calculator
(http://paraview.org/Wiki/index.php?title=ParaView/Users_Guide/Python_Calculator)
instead. It'll take care of the the VTK data set iteration related
logic for you and you can just concentrate on the expression.

Sounds like a network issue. Try telnetting to the port 11111 on
nef066 to see if you can indeed connect to that port.

Subject: [Paraview] Parallel File Formats in Paraview/VTK
Message-ID: <CAJ9o8zUC_YDxQe=DthHkzQgFFJUxQBrqUQE2uSBSa5EoYyHeoA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I know that Paraview supports many different file formats (
http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView:FAQ#What_file_formats_does_ParaView_support.3F
).
I know that the following parallel binary formats are among the ones
supported:
- VTK files (xml with zipped, binary data)
- ParaView data files
- HDF5 files (different formats)
- XDMF

What I would like to know is which format is best parallelized by
ParaView/VTK?
When using structured or unstructured grids (size in the range of tens of
gigabytes), does it
make sense to split up the file in different data sets manually? Or does
ParaView/VTK do this
automatically? Or does it depend on which of the above formats is used?
I have been using the PFLOTRAN HDF5 reader for a project (around 100
million cells), and it
did not behave very nicely so I was wondering if it would make sense in
converting the files.
Is there any difference in using XDMF (HDF5 + XML meta descriptions
if I understood correctly) or HDF5 directly within ParaView?

Thanks for the info,

Luis Manuel

Classification: UNCLASSIFIED
Caveats: NONE

I'm seeing those errors with both client-server parallel pvserver and with
pvbatch.    I'm going to throw this over to our systems people to see if
they have any ideas.   But, I'm suspicious that is a ParaView thing since it
happens on two different machines, two different compute platforms.

I can't think of anything in particular that changed that could affect this.
Are you trying this with pvserver? Can you try pvbatch? Same problem?

Caveats: NONE

I've been able to narrow down the problem to a flag that's being passed
through to the mpirun command (we have a wrapper script called
openmpirun.pbs that's used in place of mpirun).     ParaView 4.0.1 works
perfectly fine with the openmpirun.pbs wrapper script, but 4.1.0 fails with
this script.    If I diddle a flag that's being set in the script I can get
4.1.0 to work with the wrapper script. Specifically, if I change the flag
"-mca mpi_leave_pinned 1" to "-mca mpi_leave_pinned 0" in the openmpirun.pbs
script, then ParaView 4.1.0 works.

So, this is outside of my area of expertise.  Given that I compiled 4.0.1
and 4.1.0 with a (presumably) identical environment, what would bring this
runtime flag into play with version 4.1.0?   I also used the same cmake for
both builds, so hopefully cmake collected the same compile flags for both
versions.

I'm seeing those errors with both client-server parallel pvserver and with
pvbatch.    I'm going to throw this over to our systems people to see if
they have any ideas.   But, I'm suspicious that is a ParaView thing since it
happens on two different machines, two different compute platforms.

I can't think of anything in particular that changed that could affect this.
Are you trying this with pvserver? Can you try pvbatch? Same problem?

Xiao,

You can make ParaView compute a new data array that's the difference
between the values at 0 and the current timestep and then color with
that. To do that, do the following:

+ Open your snapshot000*.vtk file series as before.
+ Now, open just the  snapshoot0000.vtk file (the file for the first
time step) separately. In the file dialog, you can click on the "+"
icon next to the file group to expand the group and select a specific
file instead.
+ Next, select the filter series source as well as the
snapshoot0000.vtk source and create the Python calculator. Your
pipeline browser should like the one in the attached image.
+ Now for the Python calculator select Array Association as "Cell
Data" and setup an expression as follows to compare the quantities of
interest (as shown in the attached image).

    inputs[0].CellData["U"] - inputs[1].CellData["U"]

Now when you color by result, you'll be coloring by the difference in
the quantities  between timestep 0 and the current timestep.

If you write the data arrays containing the scalar values at the Gauss 
points to the file then you do not want to apply the "interpolate to qp" 
filter. This filter's purpose is to generate these array from nodal 
values. This means that you have to have the nodal values. You mentioned 
that you've removed them so that you won't get confused, and that will 
prevent this filter from working.

yes, that's what should happen. You're visualizing a different geometry 
- the Gguass points - so data arrays on the original geometry will not 
be available.

you can't generate the contours on a point set, you first need to mesh 
it. One way to do this would be to apply "delaunay 2d" to the point set. 
Other approaches would be more efficient and produce better results but 
would require you to write some code. eg. write out the mesh on the 
Gauss points directly from your simulation.

Subject: [Paraview] Saving Ascii Multiblock files
Message-ID: <CAHmxpstkWmUa0ZhUiEpKkcJ_pRTrVJgtz=xR7QBQLYPVNYiOrw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,


I'm running a script in Paraview for batch processing of results from CFD.
The data is composed of several AMR rectilinear meshes, so it can be saved
as several .vtr files with a single .vtm file pointing to each mesh. Using
the code snippet below, I'm able to save the .vtr files in the Appended
data mode, but I need them in Ascii in order for another program to process
the data outside of Paraview. How can I change the writer's mode?


 writer =
CreateWriter("/Users/administrator/Desktop/Research/Data/Processed
Data/file.vtm")

writer.UpdatePipeline()


Alternatively, if there was another format where I could write points and
associated vectors to text file, I could use that.


Thanks,

Jake

Subject: [Paraview] Determining distance information from an image in
	Paraview
Message-ID: <6A91658A-2A3E-4FAB-9C59-25A0C216C87D@udel.edu>

Greetings all,

  And I'll use the following image for my questions. Is there a way to determine the distance from two objects in Paraview? For instance, see the "U" shape, I was trying to measure the distance of the inner bottom, but wasn't too sure how to do it. I tried "Select Points on (d)" but that just added points on the purple sheet which doesn't mean anything and I couldn't delete them, I had to generate a new slice.

  Also, when I rotate this object, sometimes I need the alignment to be straight again, but Paraview doesn't do it. I tried "Reset" and "Reset Center" but that didn't work. Any tips?

Thanks!
Jesse

Message-ID: <CAJ-bnT5Ux8uJ_1K7sAxDQDNy2xhg3UUx+Qdmj+hVp3FUana7ig@mail.gmail.com>

It appears that VTK has a 13-node pyramid element type
(VTK_QUADRATIC_PYRAMID) but no analogous 14-node pyramid.  The 14th
node would be at the center of the square base, and would
theoretically allow one to make a conforming transition from a
VTK_TRIQUADRATIC_HEXAHEDRON to a VTK_QUADRATIC_TETRA element.

Are there any plans to add such an element, and if not, is it a task
that a complete VTK novice could even hope to undertake?

Thanks,
John

Subject: [Paraview] Changing the quick camera view tool buttons
Message-ID: <D8F69579-B219-4CD9-8654-F0A14195FE44@bluequartz.net>

Up on the toolbar there are a set of 6 buttons to set the camera view quickly (+-x, +-Y, +-Z). Is there a way to change what those do? Currently the -Z button puts the orientation like this:

^ Y
|
|
|
+------> X

With Z coming out of the screen

The views into the data I really need (to match up some other data in another program) is 

+-----> X
|
|
|
Y
with +Z pointing into the the screen.

Is there a way to change this? Without compiling paraview from source? I know I can simply use the mouse to rotate but it is nearly impossible to get the Z axis exactly orthogonal to my screen.


Thanks

If you click on "Adjust Camera", one of the small buttons along the top of
the viewport, you can change "View Up" to (0, -1, 0) to get the view you
want without using the mouse. It can be saved to one of the custom views
but as far as I know you can't change the standard views.

run the client(paraview) on your workstation and the parallel 
server(pvserver) on your 3 gpu rendering system. so for your rendering 
system you need to configure 3 X11 screens one for each GPU. When you 
start your servers you use DISPLAY environment variable to select the 
screen and GPU for each server.

Hi Seb,

Thanks for the reply.

One new follow-up on the transition to the latest revision.

I have written a new openFile method in protocols.py which uses some
custom python code to get a reader object. This reader object is then
returned by my new openFile method.

The openFile method is subsequently called from within javascript code
in a similar manner as vtk:getPipeline is called in the Visualizer demo app.

The idea being that a file will be open depending on some parameters,
without having to browse through a list. Also, the client most not know
any information concerning the actual path of the file.

The problem I currently have is that the proxy object is not being
automatically added to the pipeline browser. I can print the contents to
the browser console and seems fine.

Could you give please give me some hints on how to proceed?

Kind regards,
Bogdan

I'm not sure to follow everything here, but you should be able to call a
method to refresh the pipeline.
In fact, you can exercise it by clicking on the "server" icon of the
pipeline browser.

Hi Seb,

Sorry, my description was a bit cryptic. What I essentially wanted to
do, is add a Proxy from a data reader to the Pipeline tree.

I found a work-around for this, by using the addProxy method from
vtkweb-all.js and specifying as parameters the pipeline-browser and the
new proxy. This however meant exposing the method outside its closure,
if I understand correctly. Is there a better way to do this perhaps, for
adding a Proxy to the pipeline-browser?

Kind Regards,
Bogdan

Hello,

I am loading a BOV file into Paraview, however I do not get an option for volume representation.
Do I need to add something else to the bov header file other than standard BOV specifications?

Alternatively is there a better way to load a rectilinear uniform grid data into paraview other than using BOV header files. 

Help appreciated.

Cheers

Hmm, I'm not sure this is the proper way to do it since I get a warning but it appears to work:
a = GetActiveSource() # requires a leaf of the pipeline tree to be selected
Delete(a)
The warning I get is:
ERROR: In C:\DBD\pvs-x64\paraview\src\paraview\ParaViewCore\ServerManager\Core\vtkSMProxyListDomain.cxx, line 189

vtkSMProxyListDomain (0000000012E46ED0): Index 2 greater than max 1



Somewhere in the Python API there's a method to get the filter proxy by name but I don't remember that off the top of my head. If this doesn't work for you, Utkarsh probably has a better way :)

Dear Utkarsh,

Thanks a lot for your detailed instructions and they are very helpful! I
can show the difference along time now as a movie.
However, I still have another question. By doing this, only the difference
between current timestep and 0 is shown while the image for timestep 0
which contains the initial land/sea information is not represented. Do you
have some idea on showing not only the surface changes but also the initial
surface at the same time?

Many thanks!
Xiao

Hi Amit,

XDMF data format is a little better than BOV in ParaView for rectilinear
data. VisIt will also read XDMF.

An example code can be found here:
https://raw.github.com/openmichigan/PSNM/master/KleinGordon/Programs/KleinGordon3dMpiFFT/xdmfcreate.f90

The corresponding example program to create BOV header files is here:
https://raw.github.com/openmichigan/PSNM/master/KleinGordon/Programs/KleinGordon3dMpiFFT/bovcreate.f90

These programs take as input the number of grid points in each dimension
Regards,
Benson

Hi Amit,

Is your mesh uniformly spaced?

If I'm not mistaken, PV does not currently support native volume 
rendering of stretched Cartesian meshes (ie vtkRectilinearGrid). However 
it does support volume rendering on uniform Carteisan meshes and other 
data types. There are quick and dirty ways to convert the stretched 
Cartesian meshes to a data type for which volume rendering is supported 
in the GUI. Obviously not ideal, but would let you render something quickly.

The default BOV reader in PV is the VisIt BOV reader which always 
generates a stretched Cartesian meshes even when the data is uniformly 
spaced. This is a VisIt issue. If you have uniform spacing then you 
should use a different reader. On the other hand if you really do have a 
stretched Cartesian grid then the quickest path to a volume rendering is 
to convert to an unstructured grid. You can do this in the GUI after you 
open the data apply a threshold filter (set the threshold so that all 
data is passed, the defaults should do it).

Subject: [Paraview] turning on debug information for a filter through the
	proxy
Message-ID: <CAMaOp+GTptPRUgWJ2UukDe6fUZaciJqbuVp=oXwOMVUJEoymFA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Is there any way to turn on debug information (i.e. vtkObject::DebugOn())
for a filter on the server from the client side proxy? As far as I can
tell, all of the debug methods are for proxies and other things on the
client.

Thanks,
Andy

Ok, just figured it out. I needed to use GetClientSideObject(). For example:

s = Sphere()
s.GetClientSideObject().DebugOn()

Is it possible to limit the auto-apply feature to only work on the current
filter, not globally on every filter?

No, but there is a button in the top toolbar to quickly turn the feature on and off.

Hi Kate,

Have you tried using ParaView's auto-apply feature? It can be enabled
in the Edit->Settings dialog.

Thanks,

Hi Luis,

The answer depends on various factors - data size, file system, number of
MPI ranks, do you need support for time series, do you mind dealing with
large number of files, does the topology change over time etc etc. Usually,
the optimal solution is to implement readers most suitable for these
factors. A custom HDF5 implementation for example.

However, implementing a new reader is a decent amount of work. At this
point, I suspect that the next best thing will be using the pvd format
pointing to vtm files point to vtu/vti/vtr/vts files. To avoid the file
explosion, you may want to reduce the number of vtu/vti/... files you write
by gathering data with MPI to a smaller MPI group before writing.
Unfortunately, there is currently no support for static topology so you
will have to duplicate that for each time step. If this is a major issue, I
recommend using the Exodus format for unstructured grids. It supports time
dependent and parallel data really well and is probably the best supported
format in ParaView.

We are currently working on a new set of readers and writers that will
support distributed data much better and that will be much more flexible to
address various needs. It will take us a few more months to get there
however.

Best,
-berk

Hi John,

There are no plans that I know of. I think that you can do this as long as
you are comfortable with the underlying math. All you have to do is to find
the quadratic pyramid class (VTK/Common/DataModel/vtkQuadraticPyramid.cxx
and .h), copy it into a new class and change functions that depend on the
basis functions. You also need to add the new classname to the
CMakeLists.txt file in that directory. Just grep for vtkQuadraticPyramid in
the whole repo and replicate it for the new class. Note that the amount of
code involved in implementing such a cell is non-trivial. However, the code
itself is not that complicated. We are here to help if you take on this
adventure :-)

Best,
-berk

YOu can always look at the Python help:

e.g.

> writer = CreateWriter(....)
> help(writer)

That will print information about available properties on the writer.

Is there a way (preferably from python) to enable immediate mode rendering
only for a single object? I would like the other objects in the scene to
still use display lists.

Thank you

Here is the reduced example code for evaluation, please tell me if you can reproduce my issue (I am using the VTK libs of Paraview 4.1.0):

vtkContextView* poContextView = vtkContextView::New();
    poContextView->GetRenderer()->SetBackground(1.0, 1.0, 1.0);

    vtkChartXY* poChart = vtkChartXY::New();
    poChart->GetAxis(1)->SetTitle( "xaxis" );
    poChart->GetAxis(0)->SetTitle( "yaxis" );
    poChart->SetTitle( "Title" );

    poContextView->GetScene()->AddItem(poChart);

    // Create a poTable with some points in it...
    vtkTable* poTable = vtkTable::New();

    vtkSmartPointer<vtkDoubleArray> oXAxis = vtkSmartPointer<vtkDoubleArray>::New();
    oXAxis->SetName("xaxis");
        poTable->AddColumn(oXAxis);

    //poTable->AddColumn(oXAxis);

    vtkSmartPointer<vtkDoubleArray> oPositionlot = vtkSmartPointer<vtkDoubleArray>::New();

    oPositionlot->SetName( "Data0" );
    poTable->AddColumn(oPositionlot);


    poTable->SetNumberOfRows( 10 );

    poContextView->GetRenderWindow()->SetMultiSamples(0);

    poTable->GetColumn(0)->SetName("col1");
    for ( size_t nRow = 0; nRow < 10; ++nRow )
    {
        poTable->SetValue(nRow, 0, 1);
    }

    vtkPlot * poPlot = poChart->AddPlot(vtkChart::LINE);
    poPlot->SetInputData(poTable, 0, 0);
    //poPlot->SetInput(m_poTable, 0, nColumn);
    poPlot->SetColor( 1, 0, 0, 1 );
    poPlot->SetWidth( 1 );
    poPlot->GetPen()->SetLineType(1);

     poContextView->GetRenderer()->Render();
     poContextView->GetInteractor()->Initialize();
    poContextView->GetInteractor()->Start();

Betreff: [vtkusers] endless loop in vtkOpenGLError

Hi

I currently migrated my vtk code to vtk 6.1 and now have an endless loop in vtkClearOpenGLErrors at line 192 of vtkOpenGLError.h while using vtkContextView. This seems to be called in ClearLights of vtkOpenGLRenderer.cxx, any ideas, would be great!

Best regards
Gerald

Hi,


I am very new to ParaView and have started using ParaView 4.1. I generated a python script using the "Start Trace" and "Stop Trace" method. Now I want to run this in batch mode. When I run the same python script using "pvbatch" I get the following error. I have included the script below. Please help.


Thank you very much,
Sunil

Hi Sunil,

is it possible that you've enabled some plugin when you recorded your trace
that are not present or enabled at the pvbatch execution time?

And easy fix could be to remove the line that cause the error.

DataRepresentation1.ConstantRadius = 0.10583775824451128

My guess is that propriety on the representation is not defined in the
general case but may be extended via a plugin.

Seb

Hi Berk,

Ok, thanks for the info! This will help us to better decide the format for
the next project(s).

however.
Sounds promising!

Saludos,

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView Python console with scipy
Message-ID: <52A5E530.5030609@ec-nantes.fr>

Hello,

I'm trying to make my python script work with scipy but I'm unable make 
it work. I tried :

the Paraview 4.0.1(pvpyton from the web)  in linux (64 ubuntu 12.04)   
with the scipy of my system (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages )  and I get :

...
Traceback (most recent call last):
   File "build.py", line 17, in <module>
     from scipy import optimize
   File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/scipy/__init__.py", line 78, 
in <module>
     from numpy import show_config as show_numpy_config
   File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/numpy/__init__.py", line 137, 
in <module>
     import add_newdocs
   File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/numpy/add_newdocs.py", line 9, 
in <module>
     from numpy.lib import add_newdoc
   File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/numpy/lib/__init__.py", line 
4, in <module>
     from type_check import *
   File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/numpy/lib/type_check.py", line 
8, in <module>
     import numpy.core.numeric as _nx
   File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/numpy/core/__init__.py", line 
5, in <module>
     import multiarray
ImportError: /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/numpy/core/multiarray.so: 
undefined symbol: PyUnicodeUCS4_AsUnicodeEscapeString
..

then I tried the opposite, system python and import Paraview modules and 
I get :

...
   File "/home/fbordeu/Dropbox/chady/Aerolia/FunLib.py", line 46, in 
__init__
     self.KCOND = PXDMFReader( guiName='Kcond Vademecum ' + 
str(self.ID), FileName=self.Kcond );
   File 
"/apps/ParaView-4.0.1-Linux-64bit/lib/paraview-4.0/site-packages/paraview/simple.py", 
line 1145, in CreateObject
     setattr(px, param, params[param])
   File 
"/apps/ParaView-4.0.1-Linux-64bit/lib/paraview-4.0/site-packages/paraview/servermanager.py", 
line 254, in __setattr__
     setter(self, value)
   File 
"/apps/ParaView-4.0.1-Linux-64bit/lib/paraview-4.0/site-packages/paraview/servermanager.py",

     return self.SetPropertyWithName(propName, value)
   File 
"/apps/ParaView-4.0.1-Linux-64bit/lib/paraview-4.0/site-packages/paraview/servermanager.py", 
line 309, in SetPropertyWithName
     prop.SetData(arg)
   File 
"/apps/ParaView-4.0.1-Linux-64bit/lib/paraview-4.0/site-packages/paraview/servermanager.py", 
line 730, in SetData
     self.SMProperty.SetElement(idx, self.ConvertValue(val))
TypeError: SetElement argument 2: (unicode conversion error)

...

I search in the internet for the error, and is because the ParaView 
python and the system python are compiled with the same flags... mmm.

So I tried the same thing in my mac (10.8.5)  with ParaView from web.  :

Paraview Python with system scipy (binary from http://www.scipy.org):

...
Traceback (most recent call last):
   File "build.py", line 17, in <module>
     from scipy import optimize
   File

   File

     from . import nonlin
   File

     from .sparsetools import csr_tocsc, csr_tobsr, csr_count_blocks, \
   File

line 26, in <module>
     _csr = swig_import_helper()
   File 
"/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/site-packages/scipy/sparse/sparsetools/csr.py", 
line 22, in swig_import_helper
     _mod = imp.load_module('_csr', fp, pathname, description)
ImportError:

   Expected in: flat namespace
  in 
/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/site-packages/scipy/sparse/sparsetools/_csr.so
...


and finally system python (mac) with ParView modules :

...
/Applications/ParaViewfromWeb/Paraview4.0.1.app/Contents/Python/numpy/random/__init__.py:87: 
RuntimeWarning: compiletime version 2.6 of module 'mtrand' does not 
match runtime version 2.7
   from mtrand import *
Fatal Python error: Interpreter not initialized (version mismatch?)
...


Does any one was able to work with Scipy and Paraview (from the web). 
I'm writing some code that will execute in ParaView downloaded from the web.


Thanks
Felipe

You cannot mix and match Python provided by ParaView and system
python. You'll have to build ParaView from source if you'd like to do
that, I am afraid.

Hi Gerald,

your example isn't complete, also I had to make some substantial 
changes(based on the TestLinePlot.cxx ctest) it to get it to work. At 
any rate, to figure out if you're problem is self inflicted or not, to 
keep this simple use VTK and not PV for now, cd into a VTK build and run 
the following command:

ctest -R TestLinePlot --verbose

if those tests pass, then you can use TestLinePlot.cxx as an example of 
how it should be done. If they fail then that's something we can work 
with. report the test output from one of the failing tests. Once you 
figure out exactly what's going on, then try using VTK that's in PV.

Thanks
Burlen

Hi Alan,


How about the script:

Hi Sebastien,

Thanx for your reply,

Yes, I am using the PointSprite plugin. In order to enable this plugin with "pvbatch" I added the following line to the script. But still I get the same attribute error.

servermanager.LoadPlugin('/glb/apps/ffre-3rdparty/ParaView/ParaView-4.0.1/lib/paraview-4.0/libPointSprite_Plugin.so')

I also followed your advice of removing the "ConstantRadius" line from the script. But, now I get the same kind of error with the next statement in the script.

Am I doing anything wrong. How do I load a plugin to be used with 'pvbatch'.

Please help.

Best Regards,
Sunil

Hi Sunil,

is it possible that you've enabled some plugin when you recorded your trace that are not present or enabled at the pvbatch execution time?

And easy fix could be to remove the line that cause the error.

DataRepresentation1.ConstantRadius = 0.10583775824451128

My guess is that propriety on the representation is not defined in the general case but may be extended via a plugin.

I finally did it the dirty way.

I just copied (from the scipy sources) the functions needed to make my 
project work.

Subject: [Paraview] XMLPolyDataReader Error on Windows
Message-ID: <FCBCFB72-1467-44E4-B56B-15DCF930708D@mac.com>

Hi all,


I have about 10GB pointcloud data with CSV format.
The points have some kinds of scalar values.
I opened the data and applied Table to Points filter,
saved them as Binary XML PolyData.
The saved data were about 4GB.

Then I tried to open them, but I got errors as below:
> ERROR: In C:\DBD\pvs-x64\paraview\src\paraview\VTK\IO\XMLParser\vtkXMLDataParser.cxx, line 604
> vtkXMLDataParser (000000000D4BBA90): Error reading uncompressed binary data header.  Read 0 of 4 bytes.

> ERROR: In C:\DBD\pvs-x64\paraview\src\paraview\VTK\IO\XML\vtkXMLDataReader.cxx, line 510
> vtkXMLPolyDataReader (000000000D458AE0): Cannot read point data array "frame" from PointData in piece 0.  The data array in the element may be too short.

When I saved VTP data, I used ParaView 4.0.1 on 64bit CentOS.
The errors are dumped by ParaView 4.0.1 and 4.1.0 RC1 on
64bit Windows 7 Pro.
I tried several machines but the results were same.
The physical memories are over 16GB and HDD spaces are enough.

I also tried other large VTP pointcloud data, they were
about 2GB and had same format as larger ones.
The smaller (2GB) data could read by all ParaViews on Linux and Windows.

Are there any differences between Linux to Windows?
How can I open large (over 4GB) VTP data on Windows??

 unable to get different input labels
Message-ID: <7F781841FF1E044388AFA42B70703A7A767ED2DC@CHIMBX6.ad.uillinois.edu>

Hi, I created a custom filter that takes two inputs. During the Create Custom Filter wizard I set the Input Names to "Source" and "Filter" and add them.  However, when I use the filter the Change Input Dialog window lists the Available Input Ports as Input and Input. Is there a way to get the Change Input Dialog to use the names I entered? I exported the filter and the exposed_name attribute does have these listed.

Thanks,
Mark

It works for me if I set the PV_PLUGIN_PATH to point to the directory where
the point sprite plugin is located.

Alternatively you edit the script to use the "SetPropertyWithName" for the
ones relating to the plugin, e.g.
DataRepresentation1.SetPropertyWithName('ConstantRadius', 0.0121232312)

Hi Paul,

Thanx for your suggestions. IT FINALLY WORKS !! :)

The "SetPropertyWithName" did the magic.

I also added animation to this .py script which saves it as a .avi file. It worked perfectly fine. The I used "mpirun" to run it on 2 procs. There were no execution problems. But, the final .avi file is not working.

Do I have to change something in the script if I have to run it parallel and save a .avi file?.

Best Regards,
Sunil

It works for me if I set the PV_PLUGIN_PATH to point to the directory where the point sprite plugin is located.

Alternatively you edit the script to use the "SetPropertyWithName" for the ones relating to the plugin, e.g. DataRepresentation1.SetPropertyWithName('ConstantRadius', 0.0121232312)

Hi Sebastien,

Thanx for your reply,

Yes, I am using the PointSprite plugin. In order to enable this plugin with "pvbatch" I added the following line to the script. But still I get the same attribute error.

servermanager.LoadPlugin('/glb/apps/ffre-3rdparty/ParaView/ParaView-4.0.1/lib/paraview-4.0/libPointSprite_Plugin.so')

I also followed your advice of removing the "ConstantRadius" line from the script. But, now I get the same kind of error with the next statement in the script.

Am I doing anything wrong. How do I load a plugin to be used with 'pvbatch'.

Please help.

Hi Sunil,

is it possible that you've enabled some plugin when you recorded your trace that are not present or enabled at the pvbatch execution time?

And easy fix could be to remove the line that cause the error.

DataRepresentation1.ConstantRadius = 0.10583775824451128

My guess is that propriety on the representation is not defined in the general case but may be extended via a plugin.

Hi Michael,


Thanks for your reply.
I hope the official binaries are built with validated libraries.
The errors may against the ParaView's concept - scalability.

I can't remember if the UI allows you change the name but you should indeed
be able to change the "exposed_name" in the XML to your liking to overcome
this issue.

I am using windows

I solved the case with  2 monitors in the same gpu usig the parameter
GEOMETRY in the cave.pvx configuration file

Now, i have two desktop machines, one of them controls the main
screen(wall) and the other one controls the monitor in the floor

Creating a L-Shape

How can i set the display environment in this case using windows?

Should i have paraview compiled in order to do this type of configuration?

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview 4.1.0 RC1 Darwin corrupts animation in state
	file
Message-ID: <52A8D741.9080709@lanl.gov>

Did anyone else encounter problems with the release of paraview version 
4.1.0 RC1 Darwin for Mac OS X?

It corrupts the state file when saving it, e.g., the animation tracks 
are not displayed anymore after loading such a state file.
No version of paraview I've tried can handle the state file saved with 
4.1.0 RC1 Darwin, while the Lion version seems to be working properly.

I hope this bug will be fixed, so I can keep using my Darwin OS X.

Thanks,
Matthias Graf

Hi Utkarsh, I tried editing the XML file and it doesn't affect the GUI. However, I can see them in the Python shell if I do a dir() on the custom filter.

I can't remember if the UI allows you change the name but you should indeed be able to change the "exposed_name" in the XML to your liking to overcome this issue.

Hi, I created a custom filter that takes two inputs. During the Create Custom Filter wizard I set the Input Names to "Source" and "Filter" and add them.  However, when I use the filter the Change Input Dialog window lists the Available Input Ports as Input and Input. Is there a way to get the Change Input Dialog to use the names I entered? I exported the filter and the exposed_name attribute does have these listed.

Thanks,

I am using OS X 10.6.8 where I encounter the problem with the saving of 
state files.
A simple inspection of the state file looks like all the information 
about the animation is saved.

Matthias,

I had no luck reproducing this even on 10.6.8 with the darwin
4.1.0-RC1 binary. What am i missing? You're saving out the XML
(*.pvsm) state files, right?

Message-ID: <4E1E5431-E9E7-4DAE-8AF3-99A853D170EE@udel.edu>

Greetings all,

  I was wondering if there was a way to increase the font size of the axes I added in the slice I have (i.e. where the tick marks are). Is there anyway to increase the font, and add numbers to the x-axis as well?

  Also, see the colorbar up top? Is there a way to decrease the beginning and end numbers, i.e., 1e-16 and 1e-13?

   Thanks!
    Jesse

Yes I built it on mira at anl via the ParaView super build. I have yet to
install it system wide there.

Checking to make sure 4.1 still works there is on my todo list for this
weekend and doing the system install is on my "soon" list.

Subject: [Paraview] Cannot send vtkMultiPieceDataSet when using Catalyst
Message-ID: <2013121313000498428929@sccas.cn>

Hi all,
      When I run the Catalyst example CxxMultiPieceExample with parallel Live Data Visualization, I get errors "Cannot send vtkMultiPieceDataSet" "Socket error in call to send. Broken pipe"  as the figure shown below.
I just modify the SampleScripts/feslicescript.py slightly by changing the paramter of coprocessor.EnableLiveVisualization() from False to True.

[My paraview version 4.0.0, compiled with PARAVIEW_USE_MPI on]

The error occurs when clicking on the Live Data icons in the PipeLine panel, shown in Fig.1 . As I click it, both pvserver and paraview client are crashed, while the simulation code continues except printing the error information once as mentioned before, shown in Fig.2. If I dont force it to quit, the simulation runs well and generates proper coprocessing snapshots in fullgrid_* and slice_* folders.

Fig 1. Both pvserver and paraview crash when click

To make things clear, I insert some printf in the code FEAdaptor.cxx and found that the errors are generated when calling Processor->CoProcess().
For the sake of simplicity, I run the program with only one process in one node. 

mpiexec -np 1 pvserver
paraview #and then connect to localhost:11111 and then connect to catalyst.
mpiexec -np 1 ./FEDriver Sample/feslicescript.py

The code snippets and run time errors.


Fig. 2 Code snippet and run time error


More information are as follows.

Here is why I run this example.
I have an application in which I wanna do a parallel Live Visualization of a volume data, and is quite similar to the Catalyst example named CxxImageDataExample. But I failed to make the sub-images composited correctly by setting the extent and whole extent,  both in the example code [shown in Fig.3] and my application code. It shows the error of "RegionIDs cannot be 0". Thus I think I need a vtkMultiBlockDataSet and vtkMultiPieceDataSet to manage my volume data and its division, it this true?

Would you please take some minutes to do a simple test of these two examples to see is it running correct on your machines?

Many thanks to you!

Subject: [Paraview] Where is the Selection Inspector?
Message-ID: <52AAB1C3.1040709@tu-braunschweig.de>

Hello,

I have just been looking for the Selection Inspector in ParaView 
4.1.0-RC1, Windows 64bit binaries - but I cannot find it. It is still 
there in the View menu of 3.98.0, but in 4.1, there is only a Selection 
Display Inspector. Is it somewhere else, or is it just gone?

Kind regards
Ian

Thanks Utkarsh!

The pqObjectBuilder signal connection was the solution: Thanks a lot!

However, I have another question now, similar to forcing update. I want to
change the render views' look:
* Set parallel projection by default on 3 views. I got it to work by
setting the CameraParallelProjection in the ViewProxy of some pqRenderView :

    vtkSMIntVectorProperty* projProp;
    projProp =
vtkSMIntVectorProperty::SafeDownCast(pqview->getViewProxy()->GetProperty("CameraParallelProjection"));
    projProp->SetElements1( parallelProjection );

* Set black background by default : I did the same with the Background
property

  vtkSMDoubleVectorProperty* bg;
  bg =
vtkSMDoubleVectorProperty::SafeDownCast(pqview->getViewProxy()->GetProperty("Background"));
  bg->SetElements3(0,0,0);

Though the projection is correctly set to parallel after
pqrenderview->render(), the background still shows the paraview blue-gray.
Strangely, if I open the View settings panel, the background color is black!

Do I have to do something more than the parallel/perspective projection
setting?

Thanks!
Jerome

Subject: [Paraview] Animation using "mpirun" & "pvbatch"
Message-ID: <E92C9F08E111BB46888B5412D493C3B905314BEF@wybcvl-s-53403.europe.shell.com>

Hi,

I generated a ParaView python script using the "Start/Stop trace" method which saves the animation as a .avi file. The .avi file works when I execute the python script using "pvbatch" on one core. But, when I use "mpirun" with "pvbatch" to run it on multiple cores the resulting .avi file is not working.

Any ideas on what I might be doing wrong ?.

Thank you very much,

Best Regards,
Sunil

Hi,

I won't bother you all again : a simple pqrenderview->resetCamera() did the
trick!

Subject: [Paraview] PV crashed when processed big(7GB) VTK file with
	multi-core enabled
Message-ID: <52AAF4A3.4070601@geotricks.net>

Hi all,

I've been using PV for a while. Just recently I start to feed 
hi-resoultion LiDAR to my model. The output file is huge, 7gb with 23 
million node and even more triangles. Of course my workstation can't 
render this kind of data (I process them on a Amazon EC2 with 64GB ram), 
so I opened another EC2 and installed a new PV with MPI&OSMESA enabled. 
The remote server works well with small files. But it crashed with 
bigger one while multi-cores were used.

    "BAD TERMINATION OF ONE OF YOUR APPLICATION PROCESSES"
    "EXIT CODE :134"


It did work with one core only, but the speed is unbearable. I also 
noticed that when it worked (with one core), it only used about 11.1 GB 
of ram while the release ver. used 13.6GB in my Ubuntu 12.04 before 
crashing.

Sorry I can't provide anymore useful information. But I'd like to know 
how you guys work with this kind of big VTK file.

Thanks and have a good weekend,

KuN

It has been removed in lieu of the FindData dialog. Refer to this

There's some functionality that's still missing from FindData to
totally replace SelectionInspector, but it's on its way. What were you
using the Selection Inspector for, specifically?

The selection inspector has been removed because its functionality (at least the useful stuff) has been replaced by the find data dialog box. Go to Edit -> Find Data or find the button in the top toolbar. 

Although the top half of the find data dialog is dedicated to making a query, the bottom half is populated with information on the current selection.

Hi,

The Catalyst Live In-Situ work is still beta functionality. I haven't tried
it with a multipiece data set so it doesn't surprise me that it doesn't
work. We are looking for funding to improve this and because of this we
haven't had the resources to test it out as thoroughly as we'd like.

I would suggest moving to ParaView 4.0.1 though instead of that release
candidate.

Regards,
Andy

Thank you for your answers! I needed it to invert a selection in order 
to cut out a certain part of my model, selected with the mouse, and this 
works fine with the FindData dialog, now I know where to look.

Subject: [Paraview] PV crashed when processed big(7GB) VTK file with
 multi-core enabled
In-Reply-To: <52AAF4A3.4070601@geotricks.net>

KuN,

Normally as datasets get larger you'd  want to use multiple nodes each 
with multiple cores. 7GB unstructured data is maybe big for one node. I 
think a 64GB node should be able to handle it, although you're in 
territory where you may want more nodes depending on what you're doing 
in PV.

One issue may arise from the reader and how the data is stored on disk. 
The legacy VTK format is the worst, the XML format can be very good 
although with the XML formats I think it works best when the data is 
partitioned into chunks on disk. Which format are you using and if it's 
the XML format how many partitions on disk are there?

A related issue is that MPI used int's in its API. This sometimes is a 
problem when dealing with really large data. This won't be an issue if 
your data is in the XML format and partitioned into 2G or smaller chunks.

In PV 4.1 the command line option --enable-bt will produce a stack trace 
on stderr if PV crashes or aborts, you'd need to compile with debug 
symbols, CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug or RelWithDebInfo. This may shed light 
on what's crashing and why. In earlier versions backtrace could be 
enabled from the memory inspector panel but didn't catch abort and will 
not help for debugging MPI errors.

Burlen,

Yes the mesh is uniformly spaced.
Instead of going in round about way of using BOV format and bunch of other transforms in paraview.

What is the recommended way to doing things the paraview way for unigrid data
1) Is there a way to write a simple header like BOV for an existing dump of uniform 3d binary data?
2) Other format you recommend we can dump directly from the code, excluding ASCII VTK


Thanks
--Amit
PS: Thanks your mail got buried in my mail-list folder, so did not see this earlier.

There are quick and dirty ways to convert the stretched Cartesian meshes to a data type for which volume rendering is supported in the GUI. Obviously not ideal, but would let you render something quickly.

If you have uniform spacing then you should use a different reader. On the other hand if you really do have a stretched Cartesian grid then the quickest path to a volume rendering is to convert to an unstructured grid. You can do this in the GUI after you open the data apply a threshold filter (set the threshold so that all data is passed, the defaults should do it).

Hi Amit,

Great! If you're data is stored as binary single precision float with 
one array per scalar/component, I'd recommend the BOV reader in the 
SciberQuest ToolKit plugin. It provides both a parallel read and writer 
for PV and supports scalars, vectors, symetric tensors and tensors. The 
ascii headers are very easy to write. 
http://www.hpcvis.com/vis/sq-bov-reader.html
btw Some time ago I shared a parallel FORTRAN writer for this format 
with Mahidhar. It was quite  while ago, but I may have a copy around if 
he doesn't.

If you have some other data organization then XDMF may work.

Hi Burlen,

The data is fairly small at the moment. I tested your method on standalone binary Paraview on mac after loading the SciberQuest Toolkit, but it gives errors see below.
Few questions
1) How does paraview know which reader to use with bov format
2) Is double precision float support?
3) Are the distributed binary standalone versions of paraview built with MPI enabled as your reader has this requirement.

Here is my bov header file test_0001.bov

test_0001.gda

# The data size corresponds to NX,NY,NZ in the above example data.

Hi Amit,

Great! If you're data is stored as binary single precision float with one array per scalar/component, I'd recommend the BOV reader in the SciberQuest ToolKit plugin. It provides both a parallel read and writer for PV and supports scalars, vectors, symetric tensors and tensors. The ascii headers are very easy to write.  http://www.hpcvis.com/vis/sq-bov-reader.html
btw Some time ago I shared a parallel FORTRAN writer for this format with Mahidhar. It was quite  while ago, but I may have a copy around if he doesn't.

If you have some other data organization then XDMF may work.

Burlen,

Yes the mesh is uniformly spaced.
Instead of going in round about way of using BOV format and bunch of other transforms in paraview.

What is the recommended way to doing things the paraview way for unigrid data
1) Is there a way to write a simple header like BOV for an existing dump of uniform 3d binary data?
2) Other format you recommend we can dump directly from the code, excluding ASCII VTK


Thanks
--Amit
PS: Thanks your mail got buried in my mail-list folder, so did not see this earlier.

Hi Amit,

If I'm not mistaken, PV does not currently support native volume rendering of stretched Cartesian meshes (ie vtkRectilinearGrid). However it does support volume rendering on uniform Carteisan meshes and other data types. There are quick and dirty ways to convert the stretched Cartesian meshes to a data type for which volume rendering is supported in the GUI. Obviously not ideal, but would let you render something quickly.

The default BOV reader in PV is the VisIt BOV reader which always generates a stretched Cartesian meshes even when the data is uniformly spaced. This is a VisIt issue. If you have uniform spacing then you should use a different reader. On the other hand if you really do have a stretched Cartesian grid then the quickest path to a volume rendering is to convert to an unstructured grid. You can do this in the GUI after you open the data apply a threshold filter (set the threshold so that all data is passed, the defaults should do it).

Hi Amit,

XDMF data format is a little better than BOV in ParaView for rectilinear
data. VisIt will also read XDMF.

An example code can be found here:
https://raw.github.com/openmichigan/PSNM/master/KleinGordon/Programs/KleinGordon3dMpiFFT/xdmfcreate.f90

The corresponding example program to create BOV header files is here:
https://raw.github.com/openmichigan/PSNM/master/KleinGordon/Programs/KleinGordon3dMpiFFT/bovcreate.f90

These programs take as input the number of grid points in each dimension

Hello,

I am loading a BOV file into Paraview, however I do not get an option for volume representation.
Do I need to add something else to the bov header file other than standard BOV specifications?

Alternatively is there a better way to load a rectilinear uniform grid data into paraview other than using BOV header files.

Help appreciated.

Cheers

Hi Burlen,

The data is fairly small at the moment. I tested your method on standalone binary Paraview on mac after loading the SciberQuest Toolkit, but it gives errors see below.
Few questions
1) How does paraview know which reader to use with bov format
2) Is double precision float support?
3) Are the distributed binary standalone versions of paraview built with MPI enabled as your reader has this requirement.

Hi Amit,

Great! If you're data is stored as binary single precision float with one array per scalar/component, I'd recommend the BOV reader in the SciberQuest ToolKit plugin. It provides both a parallel read and writer for PV and supports scalars, vectors, symetric tensors and tensors. The ascii headers are very easy to write.  http://www.hpcvis.com/vis/sq-bov-reader.html
btw Some time ago I shared a parallel FORTRAN writer for this format with Mahidhar. It was quite  while ago, but I may have a copy around if he doesn't.

If you have some other data organization then XDMF may work.

What is the recommended way to doing things the paraview way for unigrid data

2) Other format you recommend we can dump directly from the code, excluding ASCII VTK

Hi Amit,

If I'm not mistaken, PV does not currently support native volume rendering of stretched Cartesian meshes (ie vtkRectilinearGrid). However it does support volume rendering on uniform Carteisan meshes and other data types. There are quick and dirty ways to convert the stretched Cartesian meshes to a data type for which volume rendering is supported in the GUI. Obviously not ideal, but would let you render something quickly.

The default BOV reader in PV is the VisIt BOV reader which always generates a stretched Cartesian meshes even when the data is uniformly spaced. This is a VisIt issue. If you have uniform spacing then you should use a different reader. On the other hand if you really do have a stretched Cartesian grid then the quickest path to a volume rendering is to convert to an unstructured grid. You can do this in the GUI after you open the data apply a threshold filter (set the threshold so that all data is passed, the defaults should do it).

Hi Amit,

XDMF data format is a little better than BOV in ParaView for rectilinear
data. VisIt will also read XDMF.

An example code can be found here:
https://raw.github.com/openmichigan/PSNM/master/KleinGordon/Programs/KleinGordon3dMpiFFT/xdmfcreate.f90

The corresponding example program to create BOV header files is here:
https://raw.github.com/openmichigan/PSNM/master/KleinGordon/Programs/KleinGordon3dMpiFFT/bovcreate.f90

These programs take as input the number of grid points in each dimension

Hello,

I am loading a BOV file into Paraview, however I do not get an option for volume representation.
Do I need to add something else to the bov header file other than standard BOV specifications?

Alternatively is there a better way to load a rectilinear uniform grid data into paraview other than using BOV header files.

Help appreciated.

Cheers

HI Amit,

The MPI requirement means that you have to start and connect to the 
server. The binaries should be MPI endowed. But the SQ reader expects 
single precision so that's not going to work for you.

The raw reader should be able to read this, but I think your metadata 
not right. the dimensions listed, 392x893x23, don't match the file size 
55,869,440 for any combination of single or double precision and cell or 
node centered data. Better get that right first.

There are quick and dirty ways to convert the stretched Cartesian meshes to a data type for which volume rendering is supported in the GUI. Obviously not ideal, but would let you render something quickly.

If you have uniform spacing then you should use a different reader. On the other hand if you really do have a stretched Cartesian grid then the quickest path to a volume rendering is to convert to an unstructured grid. You can do this in the GUI after you open the data apply a threshold filter (set the threshold so that all data is passed, the defaults should do it).

Hi Paraview Mailing List!

I am writing a python script for exporting animation images. GetRenderViews() produces a list of 3d render views.

Is there an equivalent way of getting XYChartViews? Ie something like GetXYChartViews() which seems not to exist ?

Any help would be appreciated.

Cheers,
Ray

Hi Utkarsh,

Thanx for your reply. The issue is now solved. 

The original issue was that the .avi file does get generated when I use "mpirun" & "pvbatch". But, when I use Windows Media Player to open it, I get an error that it is not able to recognize the format.

The solution was to use the flag "--use-offscreen-rendering" like below

mpirun -np 6 /glb/apps/3rdparty/ParaView/ParaView-4.0.1/bin/pvbatch --use-offscreen-rendering script.py


Best Regards,
Sunil

Can you elaborate what's not working? Is no avi generated or the animation is wrong?

Message-ID: <E70FE8EA6EBE9241BDB4CA6D8D12E1D801C285D8E285@RZJC1EX.jr1.local>


Hello

I am using the new PV 4.1.0 and cannot find the selection inspector of PV3.98 where you see the ID list of all selected points/cells and/or change the selection mode. There is only a Selection Display Inspector in the View tab of the main bar which seems to only label selected points in 3d view (since I select thousands of points this is not really sufficient for me)...

Is there a new way doing this?

Thanks,
Gerald

You're correct. It'd be certainly good to add that API (or something
similar). Mind reporting a feature request on the bug tracker
(http://paraview.org/Bug), so we don't forget about this? Thanks. In
the mean time, you can do the following:

servermanager.GetContextViews()

Can you try something: disable your network and then start paraview.
Is that faster? I believe there's call happening at the load which
check for the network name for the node which can lock is the DNS is
not responding or something to that effect. I want to verify that's
the case here so I can look at a fix.

Jesse,

While there's limited ability to change the axes labels right now, you can
change the color-bar labels. Refer to
http://www.kitware.com/blog/home/post/578 for 4.1. For older versions, same
can be done from the color editor dialog (on the legend tab, if I am not
mistaken). We are planning to make changing labels sizes for axes possible
in future releases.

Yes, there is a new way of doing this. Open the Find Data dialog box. There is a button on the top toolbar or you can go to Edit -> Find Data. In the middle of that dialog is a spreadsheet with the point/cell ids and all the fields.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [Paraview] Selection ispector missing


Hello

I am using the new PV 4.1.0 and cannot find the selection inspector of PV3.98 where you see the ID list of all selected points/cells and/or change the selection mode. There is only a Selection Display Inspector in the View tab of the main bar which seems to only label selected points in 3d view (since I select thousands of points this is not really sufficient for me)?

Is there a new way doing this?

Thanks,
Gerald

Subject: [Paraview] vtkCellQuality Filter -- not accessible anymore ?
Message-ID: <CALBJ7LKDiBJU-8Ru8rJuFWKetcGw5-X6KU4_mPnZcq7MpmmHpw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear paraview users and developers,

A big part of my post-processing method is based on the use of
ProgrammableFilter.
With that tool, I can execute Python code that I have written, just by
importing my complete Python module within the programmable filter.

Then, I use a lot of basic vtk Filters : vtkCutter, vtkThreshold, ect.
I then import the vtk module that is included within the paraview binary
distribution, using the command : *from paraview import vtk*

As concerns the Readers and Writers, I use the following command
*from paraview import vtkIOPython*

A lot of things have changed with the new 4.0 version. In particular, I do
not find some vtk Filters anymore.

One of them is the *vtkCellQuality* filter, that I use in one of my code in
order to compute the surface of 2d-cells.
Is it possible to access it from a programmable filter ? (paraview 4.0
binary distribution 64 bits)

Many thanks,

Aur?lien Marsan

Aur?lien,

if you do "from paraview import vtk", to keep things on the lighter
side, we only import a limited set of VTK modules. That's why certain
filters are available and others aren't. You can always explicitly
import the VTK module of interest.
For readers and writers, you'll have to import the VTK modules
containing the concerned readers writes.

e.g.
(exactly like you're doing for reader and writers: from paraview.vtk
import vtkIOPython). For vtkCellQuality, you can do "from paraview.vtk
import vtkIOLegacy" for *.vtk readers/writers. For CellQuality, you
have to use the following:

from paraview.vtk import vtkFiltersVerdict

To determine what module a class lies in, refer to VTK doxygen to
locate the class of interest (e.g.
http://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkCellQuality.html). At the
end it shows which directory the file resides in, in this case
"dox/Filters/Verdict/vtkCellQuality.h". The module can now be deduced
as "vtkFiltersVerdict".

Hope that helps.

Utkarsh

Subject: [Paraview] SurfaceLIC on vtkStructuredGrid ?
Message-ID: <CALBJ7LJ2_U+Tf9FhTBM43XnXDap3VwKh17+GjDyb3KOSHz9okg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

It seems that the SurfaceLIC filter does not work anymore on
vtkStructuredGrid.
Could anyone confirm me that observation ? (I'm using paraview 4.0, binary
distribution for Linux 64 bits)

It is then necessary to use the ExtractFilter in order to access SurfaceLIC
visualization.

Best regards,

Dear Utkarsh,

Thanks for looking into this in more detail. The problem seems to be on 
my side.

After more testing of saved state files, I conclude that the animation 
saving/reload and replay problem has to do with my computer's 
configuration which seems to change with security updates run in the 
background. So I can't even predict the outcome of my tests of paraview 
from day to day.
My IT guys say they don't support Mac OS X 10.6.* any longer, so I will 
have to upgrade to keep enjoying paraview.


Thank you,
Matthias

Hi Aurelein,

In 4.1 this is not the case, in fact ctests using structured grids were 
added.

Hi Burlen,

Thank you for your answer. I am indeed using the 4.0.1 version. I will then
ask for an upgrade toward the 4.1.
(but it did worked well in the 3.98 version)

Have a good day. Best regards.

Hi Cleuzir,

I changed the subject of your email in order to make it more suitable.

I think that it is still not possible to directly label the contour.
But here is a nice solution :

Burlen: That is bizarre I see the file size as 64502304 which is double precision float data ie 8* 393x892x23 as indicated in the meta data. The MPI requirement is not a big deal for me, but for end user this may be a bit of hassle. I'll take a look at xmdf stuff as well.

I am sharing a single precision data in SQ bov meta data here as well

HI Amit,

The MPI requirement means that you have to start and connect to the server. The binaries should be MPI endowed. But the SQ reader expects single precision so that's not going to work for you.

The raw reader should be able to read this, but I think your metadata not right. the dimensions listed, 392x893x23, don't match the file size 55,869,440 for any combination of single or double precision and cell or node centered data. Better get that right first.

Hi Burlen,

The data is fairly small at the moment. I tested your method on standalone binary Paraview on mac after loading the SciberQuest Toolkit, but it gives errors see below.
Few questions
1) How does paraview know which reader to use with bov format
2) Is double precision float support?
3) Are the distributed binary standalone versions of paraview built with MPI enabled as your reader has this requirement.

Hi Amit,

Great! If you're data is stored as binary single precision float with one array per scalar/component, I'd recommend the BOV reader in the SciberQuest ToolKit plugin. It provides both a parallel read and writer for PV and supports scalars, vectors, symetric tensors and tensors. The ascii headers are very easy to write.  http://www.hpcvis.com/vis/sq-bov-reader.html
btw Some time ago I shared a parallel FORTRAN writer for this format with Mahidhar. It was quite  while ago, but I may have a copy around if he doesn't.

If you have some other data organization then XDMF may work.

Burlen,

Yes the mesh is uniformly spaced.
Instead of going in round about way of using BOV format and bunch of other transforms in paraview.

What is the recommended way to doing things the paraview way for unigrid data
1) Is there a way to write a simple header like BOV for an existing dump of uniform 3d binary data?
2) Other format you recommend we can dump directly from the code, excluding ASCII VTK


Thanks

Hi Amit,

Is your mesh uniformly spaced?

If I'm not mistaken, PV does not currently support native volume rendering of stretched Cartesian meshes (ie vtkRectilinearGrid). However it does support volume rendering on uniform Carteisan meshes and other data types. There are quick and dirty ways to convert the stretched Cartesian meshes to a data type for which volume rendering is supported in the GUI. Obviously not ideal, but would let you render something quickly.

The default BOV reader in PV is the VisIt BOV reader which always generates a stretched Cartesian meshes even when the data is uniformly spaced. This is a VisIt issue. If you have uniform spacing then you should use a different reader. On the other hand if you really do have a stretched Cartesian grid then the quickest path to a volume rendering is to convert to an unstructured grid. You can do this in the GUI after you open the data apply a threshold filter (set the threshold so that all data is passed, the defaults should do it).

Hi Amit,

XDMF data format is a little better than BOV in ParaView for rectilinear
data. VisIt will also read XDMF.

An example code can be found here:
https://raw.github.com/openmichigan/PSNM/master/KleinGordon/Programs/KleinGordon3dMpiFFT/xdmfcreate.f90

The corresponding example program to create BOV header files is here:
https://raw.github.com/openmichigan/PSNM/master/KleinGordon/Programs/KleinGordon3dMpiFFT/bovcreate.f90

These programs take as input the number of grid points in each dimension

Hello,

I am loading a BOV file into Paraview, however I do not get an option for volume representation.
Do I need to add something else to the bov header file other than standard BOV specifications?

Alternatively is there a better way to load a rectilinear uniform grid data into paraview other than using BOV header files.

Help appreciated.

Cheers

Amit,

Do you have sample dataset to share? Feel free to share it of the list if
needed.

Hello,

I am loading a BOV file into Paraview, however I do not get an option for
volume representation.
Do I need to add something else to the bov header file other than standard
BOV specifications?

Alternatively is there a better way to load a rectilinear uniform grid
data into paraview other than using BOV header files.

Help appreciated.

Cheers
--Amit

Subject: [Paraview] New Transfer function editing capabilities for ParaView
Message-ID: <50320452A334BD42A5EC72BAD21450990FD843C2@MBX110.d.ethz.ch>

I am looking for reviewers/testers for a new feature branch for ParaView and VTK which introduces
new capabilities for transfer function editing into ParaView.

When viewing volumetric data, the scalar based opacity editor has been enhanced to support a new editing mode which uses Gaussian functions to represent opacity/transparency. The Gaussians can be sized and reshaped in various ways to make it easier to visualize features quickly. This feature was previously added to support the point sprite representation plugin, but the core support has now been moved into ParaView proper and allows the editing method to be used for other representations.

A second new feature is the ability to enable gradient based opacity editing from the ParaView GIU - this allows one to colour a dataset by scalar, but vary the opacity according to the local gradient of the data at each voxel. The gradient opacity may be edited using either the pre-existing Linear Piecewise, or the new Gaussian based editor.


*         1D gradient opacity editing works with the vtkVolumeRaycastMapper and the vtkTextureMapper3D rendering modes.

The combination of a 1D transfer function editor for scalars and a second one for gradient allows for a large range of new visualizations to be achieved - but the combination of two 1D transfer functions does not allow for arbitrary selections in scalar/gradient space and we have therefore added a 2D transfer function editor which allows rectangular selections to be drawn within the space (where x is used for scalars and y for gradients). Each region drawn in the scalar/gradient space may have its amplitude modulated by a Gaussian, sinusoidal, ramp or uniform function to fully control the visualization.


*         The 2D transfer function editing is supported only for the vtkVolumeRaycastMapper rendering mode

A reasonably large number of classes in ParaView/VTK have been modified to support the new features. Most notably

*         a new vtkAbstractPiecewiseFunction class has been added which forms the base for the existing vtkPiecewiseFunction and a new vtkGaussianPiewiseFunction class which creates the lookuptables which are edited by the guassian widget.

*         Gaussian and 2D transfer function widgets for qt have been added. Much of the original code for these comes from VisIt, though they have been reworked significantly to interface with ParaView. Many thanks for the origin code to the VisIt developers.

*         Histogram visualization has been added  to the new transfer function widgets for 1D and 2D modes.

*         The vtkVolumeRaycastMapper has been extend to support a 2D transfer function lookup.

*         vtkImageVolumeRepresenation has been significantly reworked to hide/show transfer functions, histograms and the rest when appropriate.

*         the vtkDiscretizableTransferFunction used by ParaView to interact with the lookuptable manager required some changes to hold the gradient lookuptables. a new vtkDiscretizableColortransferFunctionCollection class was added to hold the additional tables etc.

*         Where necessary proxy classes have been tweaked to support the new features

A short video introducing some of the features has been uploaded to youtube. We apologies for the brevity of the description included and hope that most of the new capabilities are self explanatory once the user starts to work with them.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGsc3xSlY6E&feature=c4-overview&list=UUS7l_HIyT0C-GlAv-jgDvQw

Two gerrit topics have been created, for ParaView
http://review.source.kitware.com//t/3737/<http://review.source.kitware.com/t/3737/>
and it requires the updated code from VTK
http://review.source.kitware.com//t/3736/<http://review.source.kitware.com/t/3736/>

There are a number of outstanding bugs/problems with the code.

*         Save/restore state and python interface are not working as expected. We hope that someone more familiar with this part of ParaView can easily fix this, as all the proxy classes have been used to hold relevant information so it's all there, just not correctly being picked up by the internals.

*         Histograms do not update automatically when visible and the time/data changes due to user interaction/animation, a hook into datachanged is necessary.

*         The new transfer function modes/widgets should only be visible when the correct volume rendering mode is enabled. Currently they are accessible for all volume rendering modes but only take effect when the Raycast (1D/2D) or texture mapper (1D) are selected.

*         Testing of the new features has not yet been included. One test exists but has not been committed.

*         Numerous small code formatting and class naming issues need to be resolved.

We'd very much like to get these new features into future releases of ParaView, but have limited time to continue development and address the bugs mentioned above (and any new ones that are found). We hope that by making these branches available the fixes necessary can be made with the help of the community.

The features have been implemented by Nicholas Waldin (nicholaswaldin at hotmail.com<mailto:nicholaswaldin at hotmail.com>) whilst working as an intern at CSCS under my supervision. Nicholas is currently looking for employment in the field of scientific visualization, if you have anything suitable please contact him.

Hi,

I am new here and to paraview. I have been trying to create reader plugin
for some data but even it works on my simple qt based application together
with vtk it does not work in paraview. It loads the data, I can see the

visualize anything and when I use either Volume or slices it says: Cannot

Hi

Thanks for the reply but when i click on find data dialog it tells me that I need to compile paraview with python enabled (I currently build without it, also in the past).

Do I really need python for that since PV4.1, that's really annoying for me?

Best regards,
Gerald

Yes, there is a new way of doing this. Open the Find Data dialog box. There is a button on the top toolbar or you can go to Edit -> Find Data. In the middle of that dialog is a spreadsheet with the point/cell ids and all the fields.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [Paraview] Selection ispector missing


Hello

I am using the new PV 4.1.0 and cannot find the selection inspector of PV3.98 where you see the ID list of all selected points/cells and/or change the selection mode. There is only a Selection Display Inspector in the View tab of the main bar which seems to only label selected points in 3d view (since I select thousands of points this is not really sufficient for me)...

Is there a new way doing this?

Thanks,
Gerald

Gerald,

Python is becoming ever more important in ParaView. Since some
functionality from FindData could indeed be kept accessible even not
built with Python, I've reported a bug
(http://paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=14471). However, I'd strongly
suggest enabling Python. Are you not building with Python due to build
issues or site limitations?

Hi,

I am no python guru and since i do not need it i do not build it... I tried to build it with python now but have some troubles: I had  to disable ParaviewWeb plugin (got some errors in Cmake),  then I successfully generated the cmake and become the following error on compilation:


E:\Develop\win64-msvc90-build\paraview-4.1.0\ParaViewCore\ServerManager\SMApplication\vtkPVInitializer.h(301) : error C3861: 'vtkSMDefaultModulespythonfilterGetInterfaces': identifier not found


Did you know where this comes from? I used  python lib 2.7.3.3 and modified the find script FindPythonLibs.cmake of vtk (without modification I could not find it....).

Thanks for help,
Gerald

Wow ! So great ! A very popular python feature that was missing in
Paraview.

Juste one question : will matplotlib also be directly accessible from a
ProgrammableFilter or from the python console ?

Many thanks,

A. Marsan

However it does support volume rendering on uniform Carteisan meshes and other data types. There are quick and dirty ways to convert the stretched Cartesian meshes to a data type for which volume rendering is supported in the GUI. Obviously not ideal, but would let you render something quickly.

If you have uniform spacing then you should use a different reader. On the other hand if you really do have a stretched Cartesian grid then the quickest path to a volume rendering is to convert to an unstructured grid. You can do this in the GUI after you open the data apply a threshold filter (set the threshold so that all data is passed, the defaults should do it).

Aur? Lien,

Thanks for the feedback,

The Python View could certainly consume output from a
ProgrammableFilter. Did you have another way in mind to use matplotlib
from within a programmable filter? I don't think anything would stop
you from doing so, but to have any matplotlib plots show up in a
ParaView window, you would need to have your matplotlib code in the
Python View script.

You can access the Python View from the Python shell, but it might be
a little awkward. You would have to set the script in the Python View
as a string, e.g.

>>> view =paraview.simple.CreateView("PythonView")
>>> view.Script = """
... def setup_data(view):
...   print "setup_data"
...
... def render(view, figure):
...   print "render"
... """

You could imagine loading a matplotlib script this way, perhaps.

Best,
Cory

Dear Cory,

I am seriously impressed! I cannot wait to check it out and play around
with it.

Now I have only two wishes left :). For those who are interested:
  1. I would like to be able to dynamically update (e.g. add timestep)
Paraview without
      blocking the user interface. Use-case for me is to allow immediate
correlation between
      simulations and physical tests (aerospace certification testing)
  2. More feature rich annotation of points and cells. Same reason as
above. I would for example

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView reader plugin - error: Cannot volume render
 since no point (or cell) data available.
In-Reply-To: <loom.20131217T114243-975@post.gmane.org>

Radek,

For volume rendering image datasets, ParaView only supports point
data. The "ImageScalars" array that you have as PointData doesn't seem
to be valid since it doesn't have any tuples (Number of Tuples : 0).
Number of point tuples must be exactly equal to : (dimx*dimy*dimz).
There are several problems with your code:

+ In RequestInformation, ext is incorrect. It should be (0,
header_size[0]-1, 0, header_size[1]-1, 0, header_size[2]-1)
+ In RequestData, same extent problem. You don't need to do
AllocateScalars() since you're setting the scalars array explicitly.
I'd set the dims, extent, spacing and then set the "array" as
PointData. It cannot be set as cell-data as well since for that it
would need to be of the size (dimx-1)*(dimy-1)*(dimz-1).

Look at existing ImageData producers to see how they do this e.g.
vtkRTAnalyticSource

HI Amit,

The MPI requirement means that you have to start and connect to the server. The binaries should be MPI endowed. But the SQ reader expects single precision so that's not going to work for you.

The raw reader should be able to read this, but I think your metadata not right. the dimensions listed, 392x893x23, don't match the file size 55,869,440 for any combination of single or double precision and cell or node centered data. Better get that right first.

Hi Burlen,

The data is fairly small at the moment. I tested your method on standalone binary Paraview on mac after loading the SciberQuest Toolkit, but it gives errors see below.
Few questions
1) How does paraview know which reader to use with bov format
2) Is double precision float support?
3) Are the distributed binary standalone versions of paraview built with MPI enabled as your reader has this requirement.

Hi Amit,

Great! If you're data is stored as binary single precision float with one array per scalar/component, I'd recommend the BOV reader in the SciberQuest ToolKit plugin. It provides both a parallel read and writer for PV and supports scalars, vectors, symetric tensors and tensors. The ascii headers are very easy to write.  http://www.hpcvis.com/vis/sq-bov-reader.html
btw Some time ago I shared a parallel FORTRAN writer for this format with Mahidhar. It was quite  while ago, but I may have a copy around if he doesn't.

If you have some other data organization then XDMF may work.

Burlen,

Yes the mesh is uniformly spaced.
Instead of going in round about way of using BOV format and bunch of other transforms in paraview.

What is the recommended way to doing things the paraview way for unigrid data
1) Is there a way to write a simple header like BOV for an existing dump of uniform 3d binary data?
2) Other format you recommend we can dump directly from the code, excluding ASCII VTK


Thanks

Hi Amit,

Is your mesh uniformly spaced?

If I'm not mistaken, PV does not currently support native volume rendering of stretched Cartesian meshes (ie vtkRectilinearGrid). However it does support volume rendering on uniform Carteisan meshes and other data types. There are quick and dirty ways to convert the stretched Cartesian meshes to a data type for which volume rendering is supported in the GUI. Obviously not ideal, but would let you render something quickly.

The default BOV reader in PV is the VisIt BOV reader which always generates a stretched Cartesian meshes even when the data is uniformly spaced. This is a VisIt issue. If you have uniform spacing then you should use a different reader. On the other hand if you really do have a stretched Cartesian grid then the quickest path to a volume rendering is to convert to an unstructured grid. You can do this in the GUI after you open the data apply a threshold filter (set the threshold so that all data is passed, the defaults should do it).

Hi Amit,

XDMF data format is a little better than BOV in ParaView for rectilinear
data. VisIt will also read XDMF.

An example code can be found here:
https://raw.github.com/openmichigan/PSNM/master/KleinGordon/Programs/KleinGordon3dMpiFFT/xdmfcreate.f90

The corresponding example program to create BOV header files is here:
https://raw.github.com/openmichigan/PSNM/master/KleinGordon/Programs/KleinGordon3dMpiFFT/bovcreate.f90

These programs take as input the number of grid points in each dimension

Hello,

I am loading a BOV file into Paraview, however I do not get an option for volume representation.
Do I need to add something else to the bov header file other than standard BOV specifications?

Alternatively is there a better way to load a rectilinear uniform grid data into paraview other than using BOV header files.

Help appreciated.

Cheers
--Amit

If you have uniform spacing then you should use a different reader.

You can do this in the GUI after you open the data apply a threshold filter (set the threshold so that all data is passed, the defaults should do it).

Can you try a clean build? It's unclear exactly why this this should
happen. We do build with Python 2.7* on WIndows.

Since some functionality from FindData could indeed be kept accessible even not built with Python, I've reported a bug (http://paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=14471). However, I'd strongly suggest enabling Python. Are you not building with Python due to build issues or site limitations?

Hey, Amit,

Thanks, I can now read your data using the "raw (binary)" reader and 
enable volume rendering. However, there seems to be an issue with the 
data itself, it looks like uninitialized values.

XDMF is probably a better way to go than the raw reader. Either way 
better figure out what's going on with your data.

If you have uniform spacing then you should use a different reader. On the other hand if you really do have a stretched Cartesian grid then the quickest path to a volume rendering is to convert to an unstructured grid. You can do this in the GUI after you open the data apply a threshold filter (set the threshold so that all data is passed, the defaults should do it).

Hi Burlen , thanks for taking a look at the data, the values are extremely tiny, 1e-6 to 1e-18 range that one reason I was looking for double precision.

Hey, Amit,

Thanks, I can now read your data using the "raw (binary)" reader and enable volume rendering. However, there seems to be an issue with the data itself, it looks like uninitialized values.

XDMF is probably a better way to go than the raw reader. Either way better figure out what's going on with your data.

HI Amit,

The MPI requirement means that you have to start and connect to the server. The binaries should be MPI endowed. But the SQ reader expects single precision so that's not going to work for you.

The raw reader should be able to read this, but I think your metadata not right. the dimensions listed, 392x893x23, don't match the file size 55,869,440 for any combination of single or double precision and cell or node centered data. Better get that right first.

Hi Burlen,

The data is fairly small at the moment. I tested your method on standalone binary Paraview on mac after loading the SciberQuest Toolkit, but it gives errors see below.
Few questions
1) How does paraview know which reader to use with bov format
2) Is double precision float support?
3) Are the distributed binary standalone versions of paraview built with MPI enabled as your reader has this requirement.

Hi Amit,

Great! If you're data is stored as binary single precision float with one array per scalar/component, I'd recommend the BOV reader in the SciberQuest ToolKit plugin. It provides both a parallel read and writer for PV and supports scalars, vectors, symetric tensors and tensors. The ascii headers are very easy to write.  http://www.hpcvis.com/vis/sq-bov-reader.html
btw Some time ago I shared a parallel FORTRAN writer for this format with Mahidhar. It was quite  while ago, but I may have a copy around if he doesn't.

If you have some other data organization then XDMF may work.

Burlen,

Yes the mesh is uniformly spaced.
Instead of going in round about way of using BOV format and bunch of other transforms in paraview.

What is the recommended way to doing things the paraview way for unigrid data
1) Is there a way to write a simple header like BOV for an existing dump of uniform 3d binary data?
2) Other format you recommend we can dump directly from the code, excluding ASCII VTK


Thanks

Hi Amit,

Is your mesh uniformly spaced?

If I'm not mistaken, PV does not currently support native volume rendering of stretched Cartesian meshes (ie vtkRectilinearGrid). However it does support volume rendering on uniform Carteisan meshes and other data types. There are quick and dirty ways to convert the stretched Cartesian meshes to a data type for which volume rendering is supported in the GUI. Obviously not ideal, but would let you render something quickly.

The default BOV reader in PV is the VisIt BOV reader which always generates a stretched Cartesian meshes even when the data is uniformly spaced. This is a VisIt issue. If you have uniform spacing then you should use a different reader. On the other hand if you really do have a stretched Cartesian grid then the quickest path to a volume rendering is to convert to an unstructured grid. You can do this in the GUI after you open the data apply a threshold filter (set the threshold so that all data is passed, the defaults should do it).

Hi Amit,

XDMF data format is a little better than BOV in ParaView for rectilinear
data. VisIt will also read XDMF.

An example code can be found here:
https://raw.github.com/openmichigan/PSNM/master/KleinGordon/Programs/KleinGordon3dMpiFFT/xdmfcreate.f90

The corresponding example program to create BOV header files is here:
https://raw.github.com/openmichigan/PSNM/master/KleinGordon/Programs/KleinGordon3dMpiFFT/bovcreate.f90

These programs take as input the number of grid points in each dimension

Hello,

I am loading a BOV file into Paraview, however I do not get an option for volume representation.
Do I need to add something else to the bov header file other than standard BOV specifications?

Alternatively is there a better way to load a rectilinear uniform grid data into paraview other than using BOV header files.

Help appreciated.

Cheers

Amit,

Do you have sample dataset to share? Feel free to share it of the list if
needed.

Hello,

I am loading a BOV file into Paraview, however I do not get an option for
volume representation.
Do I need to add something else to the bov header file other than standard
BOV specifications?

Alternatively is there a better way to load a rectilinear uniform grid
data into paraview other than using BOV header files.

Help appreciated.

Cheers
--Amit

Hi Amit,

I don't think that you can visualize data this small using double 
precision. You mention you have values as small as 1e-18, but hardware 
epsilon for double  precision is 1.1e-16. This means that rounding 
errors introduced in floating point operations are larger than your data!

Obviously not ideal, but would let you render something quickly.

If you have uniform spacing then you should use a different reader. On the other hand if you really do have a stretched Cartesian grid then the quickest path to a volume rendering is to convert to an unstructured grid. You can do this in the GUI after you open the data apply a threshold filter (set the threshold so that all data is passed, the defaults should do it).

Subject: [Paraview] PV 4.1 surface LIC plugin documentation
Message-ID: <52B0CA95.3080707@gmail.com>

Hi All,

I've added a page to the wiki documenting the new features developed for 
the surface LIC plugin in PV 4.1. It's linked to from the main Wiki page 
under the "other" category.
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Line_Integral_Convolution

in summary:

* added noise texture generator with 9 dof
* added an option to disable integrator normalization
* added a new pseudocolor shader
* added a fragment masking shader
* added image processing stages that help increase the visibility of the 
LIC and produce bright pseudocoloring
* parallelized the algorithm and added some caching to optimize 
interactive rendering
* added support for OSMesa and Apple OpenGL.
* bug fixes

I hope that the new features help produce better visualizations in a 
wider variety of situations than was previously possible. A myriad of 
parameters are exposed in the GUI to provide access to the new features, 
however I hope that the above documentation will help explain how these 
work and get folks up and running. The default values in 4.1 should 
match the old 4.0 defaults fairly closely, so there shouldn't be too 
much pain for those wishing to use the plugin as they always have.

Burlen

It outputs a correct string:

       E:/Develop/win32-msvc90-build/Paraview-4.1.0/ParaViewCore/ServerManager/SMApplication/vtkSMGeneratedModules.h

So the pythonfilter.xml is correctly in the list. It seems that the command is not reexecuted from cmake or the exe is not allowed to overwrite to old header. I executed the stuff manually over cmd and now It worked and compiled. Maybe someone can reproduce that strange behaviour....

Thanks for help, 
Gerald

Can you try a clean build? It's unclear exactly why this this should happen. We do build with Python 2.7* on WIndows.

Since some functionality from FindData could indeed be kept accessible even not built with Python, I've reported a bug (http://paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=14471). However, I'd strongly suggest enabling Python. Are you not building with Python due to build issues or site limitations?

Hi Utkarsh,

thanks a lot for your help!
I have followed your advice about ext and setting dim, extent, spacing
and point data and now it works perfectly fine.

Thank you

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview with python problem
Message-ID: <E70FE8EA6EBE9241BDB4CA6D8D12E1D801C286CF3C6E@RZJC1EX.jr1.local>

Hi

I successfully compiled paraview 4.1.0 with python 2.7.3 enabled in 32 bit. Paraview also starts but when I generate ANY data (over open file or over sources->Sphere or box or anything else etc.) it closes after pressing Apply. Does anyone has a clue what could cause that strange behaviour?

Thanks for advice.....

Best regards
Gerald Lodron

That's peculiar. Thanks for digging in. I'll take a look to see if I
can spot the issue. Seems like a broken dependency  or something.

Since some functionality from FindData could indeed be kept accessible even not built with Python, I've reported a bug (http://paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=14471). However, I'd strongly suggest enabling Python. Are you not building with Python due to build issues or site limitations?

Gerald,

Since you compiled from source, can you do debug build and then run
through a debugger to see why it's aborting? I don't think I've seen
this behaviour before. I wonder if its related to the dependency
issue. Was this a clean build or were you doing an incremental build?

Hi,

I am currently debugging, it closes (not crashing!) in

pqDataRepresentation* pqDisplayPolicy::newRepresentation(pqOutputPort* port,
  pqView* view) const
{
  return pqApplicationCore::instance()->getObjectBuilder()->
    createDataRepresentation(port, view);
}
Of pqDisplayPolicy.cxx

Here i cannot debug in for any reason (i come somewhere into assembler of qt and when I step out it closes). I will try debugging more ...
PS: I also checked the successful RequestData return of the sources so the source is correctly applied, it closes afterwards...

Gerald

Weird. Let's try this, but a break point in that method. It'll only be
called once after you hit "apply". Then step into the code, including
createDataRepresentation(..). If you cannot step, I think it's a
problem with mismatched/improperly built libraries or something. If
the call stack starts making no sense, it's definitely that, and I'd
recommend a clean build -- start with an empty binary directory.

It closes in 

pxm->RegisterProxy("representations", pcTest, reprProxy);

at pqObjectBuilder.cxx at line 527, and when I set a breakpoint into registerProxy of vtkSMProxyManager it gets never hit. It seems that the name.toAscii().data() is corrupted, but name is a vaild string "DataRepresentation1". When I write

const char* pcTest = name.toAscii().data();
  //pxm->RegisterProxy("representations", name.toAscii().data(), reprProxy);
  pxm->RegisterProxy("representations", pcTest, reprProxy);

and watch at pcTest it is " ?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????6

?~
h??Xl?" so it seems that:

Name.toAscii().data() is not allowed in that combination 
OR
The memory is completely corrupted from somewhere else......

Ok forgot my last mail, it is not the vtkSMProxyManager, it is the vtkSMSessionProxyManager where it jumps in and the name string of name.toAscii().data(); is correct

It closes in vtkSMSessionProxyManager:: RegisterProxy at proxy->CreateVTKObjects();, I will debug forward....

So, things seem to come to an end:

(I selected the Sphere source and pressd Apply)

vtkObjectBase *vtkCubeAxesRepresentationClientServerNewCommand()
{
  return vtkCubeAxesRepresentation::New();
}

Of vtkCubesAxesRepresentationClientServer @ 13

Where the New() seems to close my app. I then debugged to the constructor of vtkCubeAxesRepresentation  at

this->CubeAxesActor = vtkCubeAxesActor::New(); on line 50

and then I came to the constructor of
vtkCubeAxesActor.cxx on line 131:

    this->XAxes[i] = vtkAxisActor::New(); 


I must now go home and will restart the debugging tomorrow but any idea why the standard New function of vtk could fail?

Best regards,
Yours 
Gerald

Ok forgot my last mail, it is not the vtkSMProxyManager, it is the vtkSMSessionProxyManager where it jumps in and the name string of name.toAscii().data(); is correct

It closes in vtkSMSessionProxyManager:: RegisterProxy at proxy->CreateVTKObjects();, I will debug forward....

It closes in 

pxm->RegisterProxy("representations", pcTest, reprProxy);

at pqObjectBuilder.cxx at line 527, and when I set a breakpoint into registerProxy of vtkSMProxyManager it gets never hit. It seems that the name.toAscii().data() is corrupted, but name is a vaild string "DataRepresentation1". When I write

const char* pcTest = name.toAscii().data();
  //pxm->RegisterProxy("representations", name.toAscii().data(), reprProxy);
  pxm->RegisterProxy("representations", pcTest, reprProxy);

and watch at pcTest it is " ?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????6

?~
h??Xl?" so it seems that:

Name.toAscii().data() is not allowed in that combination OR The memory is completely corrupted from somewhere else......

Weird. Let's try this, but a break point in that method. It'll only be called once after you hit "apply". Then step into the code, including createDataRepresentation(..). If you cannot step, I think it's a problem with mismatched/improperly built libraries or something. If the call stack starts making no sense, it's definitely that, and I'd recommend a clean build -- start with an empty binary directory.

Did this happen during a clean build? That is, did you completely delete all of your binary files and then configure a new build from scratch? Often errors like this resolve themselves with a clean build.

Gerald,

The change you did, is invalid, since pcTest ends up being pointing to
a dangling pointer. It works in it's original form since the temporary
object returned by toAscii() is not deleted until the call returns.
More and more, I think it's definitely a build/dependency issue. I'd
suggest doing  a clean build, if you haven't already. Delete
everything in the build directory (or start with a new one) and start
afresh before debugging further.

Try a clean build :). I am sure that will resolve this issue (well,
90% sure). Nothing should close the application without exceptions or
errors, unless the libraries are mismatched -- which could happen in
case of a broken build. I'd strongly suggest doing a clean build.

If you cannot step, I think it's a problem with mismatched/improperly built libraries or something. If the call stack starts making no sense, it's definitely that, and I'd recommend a clean build -- start with an empty binary directory.

Subject: [Paraview] Where did advanced selection controls go in ParaView 4.x?
Message-ID: <CANcsQPfMULgR5Erz1krv_HOO9VCxumPFojJ_jWk4AoafC4EDWg@mail.gmail.com>

There has been a lot of discussion on the list about the Selection
Inspector being replaced with the Selection Display Inspector in ParaView
4.x.  The Selection Display Inspector has the controls related to how the
selection is displayed and labeled, but I can't find the other controls
that were in the old Selection Inspector that allowed the user to
manipulate the selection.  The ones I use most often are selecting by IDs
and the option to select cells that include the selected points.  I've
looked around, but haven't been able to find their equivalent in the new
version.  If someone could point out where those have moved, I'd appreciate
it.

Thanks,
Ben

Never mind, I just realized that this was answered.  It's in the Find Data
dialog.  I still don't see where the option to select cells that include
selected points is, though.

Also, is there any way to create a selection by specifying multiple IDs
like the old Selection Inspector let you do?  It looks like the Find Data
dialog box just lets you select one entity at a time.

OK, looks like I should have read the manual before firing off that
question.  Sorry about that.  It looks like the Query option lets you
select multiple elements by ID.  This seems to work fine for querying by id
when I enter in:

contains(id,[0,1])

for instance, but if I try to query by GlobalElementId (I've got an Exodus
file), this doesn't work:

contains(GlobalElementId,[1,2])

This gives a Python error:
...
    flag = np.concatenate(([True], aux[1:] != aux[:-1]))
ValueError: arrays must have same number of dimensions

The following works, but it's cumbersome if I have more than a couple IDs:
(GlobalElementId==1) | (GlobalElementId==2)

Any suggestions on the right syntax to use contains() to select multiple
elements by GlobalElementId?

Thanks,
Ben

No, i did not do a clean, with a clean build it worked....

Did this happen during a clean build? That is, did you completely delete all of your binary files and then configure a new build from scratch? Often errors like this resolve themselves with a clean build.

Since some functionality from FindData could indeed be kept accessible even not built with Python, I've reported a bug (http://paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=14471).

Hi again,

so now i made a completely new empty build directory and i compiled it in 32 and 64 bit in release and debug mode (whereby I only had release libs of python) and all 4 variants close like before after applying any source...... 
So I can really say that there is no dll/lib mismatch....

Which python lib are you exactly using, I use one of my colleges which works for them. May there is something wrong inside them....

Best regards,
Yours tired Gerald.....

Try a clean build :). I am sure that will resolve this issue (well, 90% sure). Nothing should close the application without exceptions or errors, unless the libraries are mismatched -- which could happen in case of a broken build. I'd strongly suggest doing a clean build.

If you cannot step, I think it's a problem with mismatched/improperly built libraries or something. If the call stack starts making no sense, it's definitely that, and I'd recommend a clean build -- start with an empty binary directory.

Uh, now i am close in debugging:

It closes in vtkPythonInterpreter::Initialize(); at vtkMatplotlibMathTextUtilities.cxx at 115

I FOUND SOMETHING WITH PYTHON; YEAH

Now I debugged further deeper:

Inside bool vtkPythonInterpreter::Initialize(int initsigs /*=0*/) of vtkPythonInterpreter.cxx the Py_InitializeEx(initsigs); call closes my app, so there is something wrong with my python... I do not have python in debug mode compiled so I am stopping debugging here, but now I know where to look....

I solved the issue:

I only copied the python libs, but python needs two environment variables. When I start paraview with following environment variables it works:
set PYTHONPATH=D:\Develop\Libraries90\DigPython\2.7.3.3\python-2.7.3\Lib
set PYTHONHOME=D:\Develop\Libraries90\DigPython\2.7.3.3\python-2.7.3

uff, thanks for help
best regards, happiest Gerald of the world....

Betreff: AW: [Paraview-developers] Paraview with python problem

Hi again,

so now i made a completely new empty build directory and i compiled it in 32 and 64 bit in release and debug mode (whereby I only had release libs of python) and all 4 variants close like before after applying any source...... 
So I can really say that there is no dll/lib mismatch....

Which python lib are you exactly using, I use one of my colleges which works for them. May there is something wrong inside them....

Best regards,
Yours tired Gerald.....

Try a clean build :). I am sure that will resolve this issue (well, 90% sure). Nothing should close the application without exceptions or errors, unless the libraries are mismatched -- which could happen in case of a broken build. I'd strongly suggest doing a clean build.

If you cannot step, I think it's a problem with mismatched/improperly built libraries or something. If the call stack starts making no sense, it's definitely that, and I'd recommend a clean build -- start with an empty binary directory.

Cool. Glad it's working. I am guessing the Windows build of Python
expects things to be under certain locations for it to work without
setting the variables explicitly.

Hi Cory,

Sorry for the delay,

Sometimes, I suppose that I would like to be able to just plot some
matplotlib graphics from the programmable filter, as if it were a standard
python script. No matter if the window is included or not within the
paraview interface. A simple matplotlib window -- like when we do show() in
a simple python script -- would then do the job.

Below is a script that illustrates what I have in mind, and that would be
inserted in a ProgrammableFilter

import postproc_module as pm      *# this is a module, with classes etc.,
> that do all the post-treatment that I want. I use it both inside and
> outside Paraview. (programmable filter / sources and simple python script)*

data = self.GetInput()
> *# Get the input of the programmable Filter, say a multiblock structured
> mesh *wall = pm.Extractor(input = data, "i=imax").get_output()
> *# Extract the wall -- behind the class is the vtkSubset function*pm.SomeMagicalClassThatPerformsSomeMagicalOperationAndOutputsGraphics(input
> = wall, array = "ps", save_result = "some_path/some_file")      *# that
> class could perform some advanced post-processing, using scipy, numpy, and
> finally display some result in a matplotlib window. *
> pm.SetOutput(self, data)      *# just put the input data as output data
> of the filter. *


Do not hesitate to ask if this is not clear.

Best regards,

Aur?lien

Hi,

I also have the issue of
"vtkPythonArgs.h" can not be found:
trying to compile Pat's demo plugin example for a filter with
python wrapper for ParaView-4.x at
https://github.com/patmarion/PythonWrappedPluginExample

I set ParaView_DIR to my upper level build dir, but the only copy
of vtkPythonArgs.h I see is in my source dir not my build dir.

I am using ParaView-v4.0.1 on Ubuntu 12.04.
Did anyone build PythonWrappedPluginExample on Ubuntu ?


thanks
Kate

Kate,

I am not sure what's the state of that repo. I'd suggest try using
code in ParaView source as a reference. Refer to
ParaView/Plugins/EyeDomeLighting. Any "module" added within a plugin
is automatically Python wrapped when ParaView was built with Python
support enabled.

I wonder if this might be accomplished using a ParaView "surface flow":

I have vector velocity data from a CFD simulation, and I would like to
visualize the flow like this:

Is there any way I can do this with paraview?

Subject: [Paraview] Loading two state files at once?
Message-ID: <056801cefda5$8e563a90$ab02afb0$@udel.edu>

Greetings all,

 

  Sorry if this seems complicated. I have two state files that have bits and
pieces I like from each and I am trying to combine them into one state file.
So I was of the approach that I would need to load one state file with a vtk
file and the other with the same vtk, but it always shows the second vtk
file's rendered image, and not the first one.

 

   Is there a way to load both state files with the same vtk file and create
a new state file with the properties and such in the pipeline browser?

 

   Thanks!

   Jesse

Message-ID: <89311B5E-D559-4D4E-8050-C72814E149C5@imperial.ac.uk>

Hi

I have been following the docs on ?"How to set up an Amazon EC2 AMI instance to run ParaViewWeb?. There seems to be a few details missing. What AWI instance is used for this example - am I right in thinking that these instructions only apply to the GPGPU instances cg1 and g2 on EC2? Also, I was also trying to get this working on a t1.micro instance for testing purpose so I can make some of my mistakes on the free tier. Has anyone got this working with a VirtualGL style solution?

Cheers
Gerard

Hi Gerard,

   I wrote that document, sorry for leaving out the instance type.  I just
had a look at the AWS console, and it appears the instance type I was
setting up was a "g2.2xlarge".  Your assumption that the document only
applies to gpu instances is correct, and although it is theoretically
possible to set up an instance to render with osmesa, I haven't done that
specifically on an EC2 instance.  I don't have any experience with the
t1.micro instance type, but I did author another paraview web document
regarding TurboVNC and VirtualGL, located
here<http://www.paraview.org/ParaView3/Doc/Nightly/www/js-doc/index.html#!/guide/virtualgl_turbovnc_howto>,
which you have maybe already seen.  Those instructions require that the
machine can run an X server, and I don't know if that's true for the
t1.micro instance type.

Cheers,
Scott

Message-ID: <C5DA96FD-B3F7-4050-9DA3-6838B2248DC9@astro.wisc.edu>

Hi folks ?

Newbie here. I?m wondering whether it?s possible to access the pixel buffer of a render window from within Python. I?m using Python to generate a set of plots which contain paraview-rendered images. Rather than writing the images to disk using WriteImage, and then reading them back in to create the plots using matplotlib, I?d like to access the render window pixel buffer directly. Is this possible?

Regards,

Rich

Subject: [Paraview] python: get names of data arrays
Message-ID: <52C28D3F.2000501@tu-braunschweig.de>

Hi,

I thought it should be quite simple, but I have not found it yet.
How can I get the names of the data arrays of an existing source in a 
python script? Or, alternatively, how can I check whether a data array 
with a certain name exists (this is what I actually want to do)?

The reason: I have different data sets, where the data arrays are named 
differently (two possibilities), but I want to do the same operation on 
both of them. Therefore, I would like to check, which of the names is 
present in the dataset I have loaded, and by that pick the correct names.

Kind regards
Ian
