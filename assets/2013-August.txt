Subject: [Paraview] New panel, widget update
Message-ID: <qbLSj60DVkPR@dVFMqtFk>

Also, had I said before, my reader y capable of generate data based in the value of the slider. This value is send using a keyinformation downstream in the pipeline.  Then I have an optimizer fiter capable of setting automatically this value(sending a request upstream). I whould like the properties panel to be updated with the final valiue.

Hi,

the short story:

In my custom reader select some values using some sliders. Then push  
the Apply, at that moment, I (I mean the reader) read the file make  
the calculations for the construction of a field and set the sliders  
to the real final values calculated by the reader (so the user is  
aware of with values are used).

the long story:

Ok, my solution can be written like this T(x,y,z,r,s,t) =  
f1(x,y,z)*f2(r,s,t)   (this is a separation of variables). where f1 is  
a nodalfield in a mesh on the x,y,z space, and f2 is a nodalfield in a  
different mesh in the (r,s,t) space.
So my file holds 2 (or more) meshes with associated fields.
My field T (that lives in a 6 dimension space) cant be visualized in  
ParaView (or any visualization tool). So my idea is to fix (r,s,t) so  
the field T  becomes T(x,y,z,r0,s0,t0) = T(x,y,z) (this is a 3D field  
and can be visualized in ParaView).

In my custom reader I use 3 slider to select the values of r,s,t, and  
then internally I search for the closest point in the mesh (to get the  
value of f2). And with the older panel I used to update the slider so  
the user can know the point that is used for the calculation.

In this video you can see the reader in action http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6Vzww_cmhA#at 
=26 (details in  http://rom.research-centrale-nantes.com/overview/)  
but in this case I use the interpolation in the r,s,t space  so no  
update is done.


It this clear enough?

Felipe

Hi Daniel,

I thought that VTK would contain the WebGL exporter which it doesn't (for
now). So you are stuck with pvpython for now.

Here is a pvpython script

>>> from paraview.simple import *

>>> from paraview.vtk import *

>>> from vtkPVClientServerCoreRenderingPython import *

>>> from vtkPVVTKExtensionsWebGLExporterPython import *


>>> Cone()
>>> Show()
>>> view = Render().GetClientSideObject()

>>> exporter = vtkPVWebGLExporter()

>>> exporter.SetFileName("/tmp/index.html")

>>> exporter.SetRenderWindow(view.GetRenderWindow())

>>> exporter.Update()

Subject: [Paraview] Issue with ParaView and python
Message-ID: <51FA9B8B.7000200@ornl.gov>

Hi,

     I'm trying to use the ParaView (latest git version) python API from 
within pure python and I'm running into an issue. The script I'm testing 
runs the sphere animation example from the PV wiki, and while the 
animation shows fine, the script crashes at completion on both Ubuntu 
12.04 and OSX 10.8.4, with slightly different error reporting. 
Everything works fine if I use pvpython (both with and without wrapper 
script), but I don't see why pure python should be a problem. I've 
attached the wrapper script I use to setup the environment (taken from 
suggestions on PV wiki) and the script I'm testing. Below, I've shown 
the errors seen. Has anyone seen this before? Is there some extra setup 
bit that pvpython is doing that isn't being taken care of by the wrapper 
script?

Thanks,
M

Are you sure you're using the same Python version as you used to build
the binaries? That could be one reason why. Another possibility is
with pure Python some libraries from other builds of ParaView maybe
getting loaded. On Ubuntu, you can use set the environment variable
LD_DEBUG=libs and LD_DEBUG_OUTPUT=/tmp/log.txt and then run the
program and look at log file to see if you see any such mismatch.

Message-ID: <CADHSJjD530oz=wsn=OaYOf4W6-QzruQmMN4MfkCC7td0SMSvPQ@mail.gmail.com>

The short answer is this is not possible. The properties panel is not
really meant to show results produced by the filter/reader. You could
add a "information panel" i.e. a new dock widget that shows all such
relevant information ad then you can use custom information properties
on the proxy for the reader to query the current value for f2, for
example.

We could extend the pqProxyWidget class to show widgets for
information-only properties, but that too won't solve your problem
since ParaView will not know when the information has changed.
Currently, it will do that when the property on that proxy was changed
and the user hit apply -- which is a good time to assume some of the
information-properties may have changed.

Sorry, I don't have a direct answer for you, but I hope that gives you
some ideas.

the debugging variables and after poring over the log file, I only see
libraries from the ParaView git version I built being requested. Anything
else I should look into?

Subject: [Paraview] Changing X3D Exporter to Export For All Timesteps
Message-ID: <CAHPk-d2U8mMEu4onVaGABkzscDMq2s7ZQXco4C12YPoqoNFLqQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I have been trying for a while to understand how the vtkIOExport classes
work to create an X3D file in ParaView. My goal is to ultimately come up
with a way to export an X3D file with actors that have interpolated
properties through all timesteps.

At this point ParaView's X3DExporter exports only the current timestep
scene. I wanted to be able to change this so that the exporter would also
go into the other timesteps and gather attributes for each actor (i.e.
position, rotation).

While I already have some ideas as to how to create the interpolation, I am
stuck at trying to find a way to get the scene data (the collection of
actors) for all timesteps instead of just one.

Any help would be appreciated.


Thank you,
Artur Aguiar

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview crashes on .vtu file load
Message-ID: <51FB5E4E.6060005@geophysik.uni-muenchen.de>

Dear Paraview-user and developers,

Paraview crashes immediately once I try to load ascii .vtu files I 
self-wrote with a small python wrapper.
No error messages are parsed and I am lost in finding the reason for the 
crash.

An example .vtu file causing the crash I uploaded here:
https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/12694118/sample_unstruct_tet.vtu

Thank you very much,
Alice Gabriel

Here the python wrapper:

[...]

fo.write('<VTKFile type=\'UnstructuredGrid\' version=\'0.1\' 
byte_order=\'BigEndian\'>\n')
fo.write('<UnstructuredGrid>\n')
fo.write('<Piece NumberOfPoints=\'' + str(npts) + '\' NumberOfCells=\'' 
+  str(nelem) + '\'>\n')
fo.write('<Points>\n')
fo.write('<DataArray type=\'Float64\' NumberOfComponents=\'3\' 
Format=\'ascii\'>\n')

for i in range(npts):
     fo.write('   ' + str('{: .16E}'.format(data[0,i])) + '   ' + 
str('{: .16E}'.format(data[1,i])) + '   ' + str('{:

fo.write('</DataArray>\n')
fo.write('</Points>\n')
fo.write('<Cells>\n')
fo.write('<DataArray type=\'Int32\' Name=\'connectivity\'

      fo.write(' ' + str('{:6d}'.format(elems[0,i])) + ' ' + 
str('{:6d}'.format(elems[1,i])) + ' ' + str('{:6d}'.format(elems[2,i]))

fo.write('</DataArray>\n')
fo.write('<DataArray type=\'Int32\' Name=\'offsets\' Format=\'ascii\'>\n')

fo.write('</DataArray>\n')
fo.write('</Cells>\n')

Alice,

Your sample file provides 1874 points and 8577 cells, but each cell data
set consists of merely 1874 values, not 8577 values. In your script change

  fo.write('<CellData Scalars=\'scalars\'>\n')
  ...
  fo.write('</CellData>\n')

to

  fo.write('<PointData Scalars=\'scalars\'>\n')
  ...
  fo.write('</PointData>\n')

regenerate your vtu file and ParaView won't segfault any more.

Hope that helps,
Karl

Subject: [Paraview] Linking against ffmpeg 2.0 fails
Message-ID: <20130802113122.GA7318@quark>

Hello,
My distribution just updated to ffmpeg 2.0 yesterday and this breaks
compiling with paraview 4.0.1.
I have pastebined a full output of the compiling process here
http://sprunge.us/SfCR
Nevertheless I was able to link paraview against a ffmpeg-compat
version, which is also in our repos and so paraview still works fine,
I just wanted to report this, that the devs know about the problem.
Greetings
Mathias

Hi again Sebastien,

Thanks for your answer. I attach the code I am going to use in case someone
finds it useful and I will also appreciate suggestions about how to improve
it:

from paraview.simple import *
from paraview.vtk import *
from vtkPVClientServerCoreRenderingPython import *
from vtkPVVTKExtensionsWebGLExporterPython import *

vtkreader = LegacyVTKReader()
vtkreader.FileNames = "model.vtk"

dp = Show(vtkreader)
dp.Representation = 'Points'

elev = Elevation(vtkreader)
pData = elev.PointData[2]
range = pData.GetRange()

dp.LookupTable = MakeBlueToRedLT(range[0],range[1])
dp.ColorArrayName = "Pressure"

renderView = GetRenderView()
# Gradient background
renderView.Background = [0.06274509803921569, 0.06666666666666667,
0.06274509803921569]
renderView.Background2 = [0.4745098039215686, 0.47058823529411764,
0.4745098039215686]
# Object axis invisible
renderView.CenterAxesVisibility = 0

# Export to HTML
view = Render().GetClientSideObject()
exporter = vtkPVWebGLExporter()
exporter.SetFileName("C:\\b.html")
exporter.SetRenderWindow(view.GetRenderWindow())
exporter.Update()

Thanks a lot for your help.

Daniel.

If you are looking for the most up-to-date ParaViewWeb release, you should
use our ParaView 4.x binaries that already contains the new version of
ParaViewWeb. With that version, you don't need any extra/external libraries.

Thank you for the fast responses!

The bugfix suggested by Karl worked fine for me, thanks for picking up 
on that!

Marco Nawjin pointed me towards using the Python VTK binding classes and 
then use the corresponding VTK XML writer to create the vtu file, which 
I will try for binary output.
Best regards,
Alice

Subject: [Paraview] Dimensions of a Hyperslab
Message-ID: <CAK3dKUnHtwoCVyGzwMGf7VNvGCK-f9Tp3uodw0+m0qGFx1Ew8Q@mail.gmail.com>

I am facing an odd situation concerning the creation of a Hyperslab.  To
get paraview to correctly read my data I must specify the dimensions of a
Hyperslab using values for the Dimensions attribute one less that I expect.

I have DataItem that has DImensions "7 193 32".  The slowest
varying dimensions (7) is the timestep.  So this data represents 7
timesteps of 2D data that is 193x32.  The data is centered on the nodes.
 If I create a Hyperslab with dimensions "1 193 32" or "0 193 32" in
paraview the resultant data array is of length 6368.  This is 192 more
points than expected.  The value of the first 6176 (193x32) points contains
the data from the referenced HDF5 file.  The extra 192 points contains
"random" data, I assume the contents of the uninitialized memory which was
allocated.

First is this the expected behaviour and if so can someone explain why as I
can not formulate a reasonable rational for what I see.

The XDMF follows.

Thanks,
Robert

Subject: [Paraview] Writing single data array to file
Message-ID: <CAP9rB8-7c+BjAu5BiXqh1VTXD6aJXW2Y8fPcPDJQ=pDhuAFAgg@mail.gmail.com>

I am writing a batch processing script to which writes the output of some
filters to a file. I am really only interested in one of the data arrays in
the result and it would be nice to pass that single data array to a writer,
e.g. CSVWriter. Is this possible? If so, how do I do it? An outline of my
script is below:

servermanager.LoadState(options.inputf)
GetSources()
dr = FindSource("dissipation_rate")

## I Want to get a single data array from object/source dr ###
dr_array = ???

writer = CreateWriter(options.outputf,dr_array)
writer.FieldAssociation = "Cells"
writer.UpdatePipeline()

Subject: [Paraview] Catalyst : crash using vtkSmartPointers
Message-ID: <E494AC40135C1449BFE401739AD4218913347E2F@E-EXDAGE-A0.extra.cea.fr>

Hello,

I try to understand if (and how) I can use Catalyst for my need (in-situ visualisation). I started with : http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Catalyst/Overview

To code the adaptor, you need to handle VTK objects. When using VTK, I generally prefer to use smart pointers (avoid looking for leaks).
Here is my code (this is the only call / use of VTK object in the all code)
paraviewAdaptor::paraviewAdaptor ()
{
  _spProcessor = vtkSmartPointer<vtkCPProcessor>::New ();
//  _spProcessor -> Initialize (); // Crash if uncommented ?!
}
Compilation is OK, but at run time I get a crash with this error message :
*** The MPI_Comm_free() function was called after MPI_FINALIZE was invoked.
*** This is disallowed by the MPI standard.

So I tried to use pointers instead of smartpointers :
paraviewAdaptor::paraviewAdaptor ()
{
  _pProcessor = vtkCPProcessor::New ();
  _pProcessor -> Initialize (); // Don't crash ?!
}
And I don't get any crash anymore ?!....

Why is that ? How can I use vtkSmartPointers ?

Note : I use ParaView-v4.0.1-source.tgz and I run on Ubuntu 12.04

Thanks,

FH

Hi Felipe, Utkarsh,

I'm interested in this too because the custom panel of my reader (the
SourceForge version of the OpenFOAM reader) does a similar thing. In
my scenario I wanted to add some text actors on the 3D views outside of
the pipeline. The world coordinates of the actors are calculated by
the reader during update and the panel pulls the results after the
update. Then the panel instructs back the server to generate text
actors outside of the pipeline and to superimpose them on the 3D
views.

I haven't tried the new panel architecture yet but in the old
architecture, I created a slot (named onDataUpdated()) in my custom
panel code and connected it to the dataUpdated() signal of the
corresponding pqPipelineSource of the reader proxy (not the
dataUpdated() of the pqProxyPanel). The methodology worked well for
the old architecture. I wonder if by any chance it also works for the
new one or not?

Hi,

I didn't have any problems using a vtkSmartPointer for vtkCPProcessor. I'd
have to see your full code to know for sure but my guess is that
_spProcessor is a pointer to a vtkCPProcessor and not a
vtkSmartPointer<vtkCPProcessor>. When I make that mistake I get a crash.

Regards,
Andy

It seems the crash occurs at Delete for both "regular" pointers and vtkSmartPointer ?!

Can someone reproduce the problem ? If yes, does somebody know what and where is the problem ?!

There are 4 situations :

1. pointer commented + smart pointer allocated but not used : no crash

To code the adaptor, you need to handle VTK objects. When using VTK, I generally prefer to use smart pointers (avoid looking for leaks).
Here is my code (this is the only call / use of VTK object in the all code)

  _spProcessor = vtkSmartPointer<vtkCPProcessor>::New ();
//  _spProcessor -> Initialize (); // Crash if uncommented ?!
}
Compilation is OK, but at run time I get a crash with this error message :
*** The MPI_Comm_free() function was called after MPI_FINALIZE was invoked.
*** This is disallowed by the MPI standard.

So I tried to use pointers instead of smartpointers :
paraviewAdaptor::paraviewAdaptor ()
{
  _pProcessor = vtkCPProcessor::New ();
  _pProcessor -> Initialize (); // Don't crash ?!
}
And I don't get any crash anymore ?!....

Why is that ? How can I use vtkSmartPointers ?

Note : I use ParaView-v4.0.1-source.tgz and I run on Ubuntu 12.04

Thanks,

FH

Hi again everyone,

I realized that I have an extra problem after importing paraview.simple.
Everytime I import it in python/pvpython, it hangs after the 'exit()'
command.

I also created a module that includes this funcionality. When a python file
uses my module, it hangs also at the end of the script.

Everything works perfectly, but It seemes that there is something wrong
with this module when finishing scripts. I have even tried with a one-line
script containing just: "from paraview.simple import *" and it hangs too.

Any idea about this? I am using Windows 7 and Paraview 4.0.1. I tried with
Paraview 3.9 and doesn't work either.

Thank you,

Daniel.

Subject: [Paraview] Which file formats support specified time in a time
	series?
Message-ID: <CANmPiKDX24cVV8HqrT93o0Q36wBDT3x9ra8g-tUkV0d8Q5JnRA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

What options exists in terms of file formats ParaView can read that
supports time-series data where you can specify the time for each
dataset in the series?

I know XDMF supports this and we have a solution for my particular
problem that uses XDMF and HDF5, but I'm wondering what other options
there might be as working with HDF5 can be... challenging.

Could I abuse XDMF to point to a collection of VTK multiblock XML
files, for instance?

Thanks!
Cory

Not sure to follow...

If you are running your script in pvpython why would you need an exit()
call ?

When I create the following file:

=== test.py ====

from paraview.simple import *
Cone()
Show()
Render()

and run $ pvpython test.py

The application run and exit just fine...

You could use pvd format to point to VTK multiblock timeseries xml
files. I started a Wiki page a little while ago collecting tribal
knowledge about readers:
http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/ParaView_Readers_and_Parallel_Data_Distribution

It still needs a lot of love, but I thought I'd raise that up here,
just to build awareness among users and developers alike :).

Hi,

I solved it. It had nothing to do about Paraview but about my little
experience on python scripting. I used argument parsing and called
'sys.exit()' when a wrong parameter was introduced, and that was my
problem. Now everything works fine.

Thank you again Sebastien,

Dani.

Hi,

I think the only problem was that you needed to delete adaptor before
finalizing MPI. I attached my changes which do that.

Andy

Subject: [Paraview] Build errors due to missing OSMesa include directory
Message-ID: <52011733.5050906@surfsara.nl>

Hi,

I get build errors with 3.98.1 and the following config command:

$HOME/software/cmake-2.8.11.2/bin/cmake \
     -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/opt/intel/impi/4.1.0.024/bin64/mpicc \
     -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/opt/intel/impi/4.1.0.024/bin64/mpicxx \
     -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/software/paraview-osmesa-3.98.1 \
     -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
     -DPARAVIEW_BUILD_QT_GUI=OFF \
     -DPARAVIEW_USE_MPI=ON \
     -DPARAVIEW_ENABLE_PYTHON=ON \
     -DPARAVIEW_INSTALL_DEVELOPMENT_FILES=ON \
     -DVTK_USE_MPI=ON \
     -DVTK_USE_X=OFF \
     -DVTK_USE_OFFSCREEN=ON \
     -DVTK_OPENGL_HAS_OSMESA=ON \
     -DVTK_MPIRUN_EXE:FILEPATH=/opt/intel/impi/4.1.0.024/bin64/mpirun \
     -DOSMESA_INCLUDE_DIR=$HOME/software/osmesa-7.9.2/include \
     -DOPENGL_INCLUDE_DIR=$HOME/software/osmesa-7.9.2/include \
     -DOPENGL_gl_LIBRARY="" \
     -DOPENGL_glu_LIBRARY=$HOME/software/osmesa-7.9.2/lib/libGLU.so \
     -DOSMESA_LIBRARY=$HOME/software/osmesa-7.9.2/lib/libOSMesa.so \
     ../ParaView-3.98.1-source

Seems to be due to OPENGL_INCLUDE_DIR not being used in all the right 
places. The correct include path is present in the cache:

[paulm at int2 t]$ grep osmesa-7.9.2 CMakeCache.txt

Any clues which CMake variables to check to get this compile working?

Hi Paul,

Could it be that you didn't set OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY library? At least 
that's one difference I see between your config and mine. See the 
following cmake config, which works for me with 3.98.1.

this maybe unrelated to your current problems, but there's no compelling 
reason to use the MPI compiler wrappers. It should work, but in practice 
sometimes it leads to odd issues. At least that's my experience. So I'd 
say that if you don't want to be debugging wierd issues use an actual 
cxx compiler. Intel's compilers work fine with PV.

For a while at least, ParaView assumed there was going to be some sort
of screen usage if OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY was set.

The instruction is still at the bottom of the wiki :

Hi Burlen,

I explicitly don't set the opengl_gl_library value as per these instructions (3rd option, pure offscreen rendering): http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Users_Guide/Parallel_Rendering

I'll see tomorrow if setting that value to the osmesa libs helps. I would like to ditch the  mpi compiler wrappers, will check that out too 

Paul

That's a good reason to do so, ;-) I think I've always (PV > 3.10) set 
opengl_gl_library pointing to os mesa library... Some of the info on 
those pages is out dated, my mesa configure lines look a bit different too.

Good luck, be sure to report back what finally works for you.

Setting opengl_gl_library didn't help, unfortunately, still the same 
compile error due to GL/gl.h not being found.

The strange thing is that I've been using the cmake config line I posted 
earlier on a different cluster and there it works fine.

I wonder if you could get by setting

CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=-I/home/paulm/software/osmesa-7.9.2/include

?

And as always just after you post something you come up with the next 
step to take, ah well, it's late :)

I just compared the working build against the build missing GL/gl.h and 
the difference is that with the working build what actually gets 
included is /usr/include/GL/gl.h, not the GL/gl.h header from the OSMesa 
installation (hooray for gcc -E). On the system where the build fails 
there is no system-wide <GL/gl.h>, as it has no GPUs, no X, etc... and 
the OSMesa include dir isn't doesn't get correctly added to the search path.

Workaround: add a -I <osmesa include directory> to CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS

(which is just what you suggested while I was writing this and waiting 
(even at make -j64) for my build to finish :))

Blegh, that took better part of a day,
Paul

Subject: [Paraview] Script to save avg value in an array
Message-ID: <CAM3A=6j8ceMWLcucLeeYWuraGRzc8yT5P5J9h=jFsgMZTa+TwQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I need a small favor in writing a small python script. I calculate average
stress in the domain based on the strain values using an analytical
expression. The avg. stress value is calculated at one time instant.

I need to save the average stress at every time instant  in an array ,
which will later be plotted to obtain the avg. stress value with time.

I am not conversant with the Paraview scripting. Please let me know how to
write a script to acheive above task.

The results are plotted in paraview in the ensight case format.

Warm regards,
Rakesh

Subject: [Paraview] Visualize 3Gb CFX-data on singel PC with ParaView
Message-ID: <CANaEcozWtK66Ky_EjFN99R8Za21G79zmN=7++SXcN3sZOG=f8A@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I trying to understand is it reasonable to use ParaView in desktop mode
(without distributed server) to visualize CFX-data (converted to EnSight
format) with size ~3Gb?

How to solve such task if I need to visualize such large data array? Should
I point CFD-people to simplify their model for visualization purpose or
should I use distributed server ParaView mode? Or might be it is not a
problem to visualize such large data array with ParaView on single PC (8
cores, 30Gb RAM).

Thank you in advance,
Alexander Petrov

Do you have  sample dataset that you can share and the expression you
want to use? That'll make it easier.

Likely possible on a good desktop.

The number of cores is pretty much immaterial. Most of VTK and ParaView
only use 1.
The RAM is very important. Make sure that you have a 64bit build of
ParaView of course or you won't be able to access all of the RAM.
You didn't specify it, so the graphics card is the potential bottleneck,
make sure you have something recent or rendering may bog down.

Also, be wary of doing things with ParaView that multiply the effective
size of the data. The ParaView book and tutorial cover these best practices
pretty well. http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/UsersGuide/Recommendations

Yes you generally still need MPI installed. You may also need to build
paraview yourself.

At Kitware we inconsistently include MPI in our binaries due to technical
difficulties regarding the range of OS's and versions we build for. Also,
the MPI we distribute is likely not compatible and almost certainly not
optimal on your hardware. Depending on your OS and distribution, there may
be paraview-MPI package you can simply pull.

And you are correct. Once you get paraview with mpi installed, run mpiexec
-n N pvbatch to run it in parallel.

See also: http://paraview.org/paraview/resources/webinars.html "Big Data
Analysis" and
http://extremecomputingtraining.anl.gov/files/2013/07/DOEPV.pdf for more
background knowledge.

Is there an argument to specify to use multi core on shared memory
clusters? Otherwise I assume that a MPI version is required and I'd run it
using "mpiexec -n Nprocs pvbatch python.py"

Subject: [Paraview] VRPlugin crashes when loading VR states with interactor
	styles
Message-ID: <201308071657.37219.johannes.zarl@jku.at>

Hi,

When loading a VR state in the VRPlugin, paraview often crashes if there is a 
VRInteractorStyle defined. The reason for this is that if the proxy/proxyName 
doesn't match anything in the current state, the style cannot be configured. If 
the style is then added to the VRQueueHandler, ParaView crashes.

The attached patch fixes the crash.

Cheers,
  Johannes

Takuya,

You can still continue to do what you're doing. You can add a custom
widget for some property that still listens to the dataUpdated() event
from the pqPipelineSource corresponding to the reader's proxy.  But I
don't think logic, as this this for adding text to views should be in
the panel. It should be a separate component, e.g. the behaviors
(http://www.paraview.org/ParaView3/Doc/Nightly/www/cxx-doc/group__Behaviors.html).
That makes it possible to handle the cases where multiple views are
created/added more gracefully than one could with the panel.

If you can point me to the code, I wouldn't mind taking a look. Also,
should we be moving this reader/panel code into ParaView itself?

There is always the option of using the python programmable filter.
The content of the script should be something to the effect of.
odata = self.GetOutput()
idata = self.GetInput()
odata.GetPointData().AddArray(idata.GetPointData().GetArray("foo)")

Hi there,

I am trying to use the following command to print an image of a sliceFilter I create:
/home/bcurtis/Downloads/Paraview/bin/pvbatch --use-offscreen-rendering /home/bcurtis/Desktop/newscreenshots.py
(eventually i'll use mpirun for all my other legacy VTK files)

I run the following code which crashes at view.StillRender(). I have also pasted the code and crash below.

CODE: http://paste.ubuntu.com/5959376/
CRASH: http://paste.ubuntu.com/5959378/

I have read a lot of online resources and I just can not pinpoint what the issue is. I hope you can help me out!

Hi,

I think this happens because VTK failed to create a valid rendering 
context. There could be some issue with Open GL on your system, or some 
interaction with PV and your Open GL install.

Have you built PV from sources here or is this a binary download?

I saw in your CMake config that both libGL and libOSMesa are used. 
Because you are not using X11 you really only need OS Mesa. I'm 
wondering if the mixing of libGL and libOSMesa is the source of the 
issue here?

would you mind re-building but change your cmake config using the 
following as a guide? When you run I think you can safely omit the 
--use-offscreen-rendering flag.

#!/bin/bash
MESA=/work/apps/mesa-dev/
cmake \
...
   -DPARAVIEW_BUILD_QT_GUI=OFF \
   -DVTK_USE_X=OFF \
   -DVTK_OPENGL_HAS_OSMESA=ON \
   -DOPENGL_INCLUDE_DIR=$MESA/include \
   -DOPENGL_gl_LIBRARY=$MESA/lib/libOSMesa32.so \

I'm using the Superbuild to build ParaView 4.0.1 .... and I'm enabling CGNS but the reader doesn't seem to be there.   I can see that it downloaded at cgnslib tarball and it seems to have been built.    I poked around on the Wiki and there's also a mention of using the VisIt bridge.     Is the VisIt bridge (which I'm not using) the only way to read a CGNS file?

Rick,

Correct, VisItBridge is required for CGNS support. You can turn on
VisItBridge by using the ENABLE_visitbridge cmake option.

I was afraid you say that!   8-)

So, are there any additional parameters that need to be set, such as where the VisIt libraries are installed, etc?   In the Superbuild, I've looked in the CMakeCache.txt file, and I don't see any additional parameters for the bridge or for cgns.

Is this page still current and correct?   http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/VisIt_Database_Bridge#CGNS_Support

Rick,

Correct, VisItBridge is required for CGNS support. You can turn on
VisItBridge by using the ENABLE_visitbridge cmake option.

I think the only extra flag will be make sure boost is one of the projects
superbuild makes. When superbuild makes paraview it will see this and then
turn visitbridge on and link it in when it configures paraview.

Robert probably knows best the state of this particular file format.

OK great, that seems to have fixed that crash. Now onto another crash

I saw in your CMake config that both libGL and libOSMesa are used.
Because you are not using X11 you really only need OS Mesa. I'm
wondering if the mixing of libGL and libOSMesa is the source of the
issue here?

would you mind re-building but change your cmake config using the
following as a guide? When you run I think you can safely omit the
--use-offscreen-rendering flag.

#!/bin/bash
MESA=/work/apps/mesa-dev/
cmake \
...
   -DPARAVIEW_BUILD_QT_GUI=OFF \
   -DVTK_USE_X=OFF \
   -DVTK_OPENGL_HAS_OSMESA=ON \

Hmm, haven't seen that one, but since it's a failed assertion, it may be 
that you're attempting something that's not legit.

Are you running this using pvbatch? I don't think you need to call 
Connect/Disconnect with pvbatch. Does removing those calls help?

You might also simplify and bulletproof your code by using the functions 
in "simple.py" (see source tree). I'm not familiar enough with pv python 
to say whether or not your doing something illegal in your code by 
accessing servermanager directly.

I went ahead and removed the servermanager.Connect() and that had no change.

What seems to be causing the issue is the view.StillRender() (and/or) view.WriteImage(...) and using mpirun with pvbatch.
(Code works fine when not using mpirun)

I hope someone more familiar with this can help.

Thanks,
~Brian

The code is available from (it's still an SVN project):
svn checkout svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/of-interfaces/code/trunk/vtkPOFFReader

I would be _very happy_ if you (or someone) integrate the code into
ParaView itself.

Subject: [Paraview] Help with unstructured grid
Message-ID: <CAOOtQ91RMO4eCwQMHta+vPzibfzP-C9OtYdxfPUn5joShz9CYg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I have a fortran code that I'm trying to get streamlines from. The code
generates a spherical grid of points and a velocity on each of those
points.

I have been using a structured grid but paraview doesn't seem to read the
vectors, instead it thinks they are more grid points and plots them as
such. From what I've read it looks like I need to use an unstructured grid
but I don't know how to set up the cell commands for that.

Here are the lines of my code that write the .vts files:


        write(113,*) '# vtk DataFile Version 3.0'
        write(113,*) 'This is the cartesian velocity field'
        write(113,*) 'ASCII'
        write(113,*) 'DATASET STRUCTURED_GRID'
        write(113,*) 'DIMENSIONS',nx,ny,nz

        do k = 1, nphi + 1
        do j = 1, nth  + 2
        do i = 1, nr
        write(113,*) xc(i,j,k), yc(i,j,k), zc(i,j,k)
        enddo
        enddo
        enddo

write(113,*) 'POINT_DATA',nx
write(113,*) 'VECTORS velocityfield float'
write(113,*) 'LOOKUP_TABLE default'

        do k = 1, nphi + 1
        do j = 1, nth  + 2
        do i = 1, nr
        write(113,*) ux(i,j,k), uy(i,j,k), uz(i,j,k)
        enddo
        enddo
        enddo

Could anyone let me know how I should modify this for an unstructured grid?

Thanks
George

Hi,

I am not really familiar with vtk DataFiles but from a first look, I 
would say you are missing a "write(113,*) 'POINTS' nx*ny*nz float" line 
after the Dimensions.

On page 3 of:
http://www.vtk.org/VTK/img/file-formats.pdf

it says:
DATASET STRUCTURED_GRID
DIMENSIONS nx ny nz
POINTS n dataType
p0x p0y p0z
p1x p1y p1z
...
p(n-1)x p(n-1)y p(n-1)z

And I think the number of Point_Data-sets should be nx*ny*nz instead of 
nx, although you did not tell us too much about your problem. If this 
does not work you should post the output file, of lets say a 4 point 
grid from your code, instead of the source.

Good luck!

Message-ID: <CANaEcoxP7EYdaOQpgVUSxAQK5UZ7REpJu0P8fpyz1knQ9jgJ5A@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I have a model with stream lines, and I want to animate it for
presentations purpose. In fact I need to animate small spheres and get them
flying upon stream lines' trajectories. I hope it will look like a dynamic
stream :)

I couldn't find a standart way to do that. Should I use python for that?

Thank you,
Alexander Petrov

Alexander,

I guess you are looking for a solution similar to what Jean posted on this list
a few years back: see http://markmail.org/message/ms57z7jjubh2pzjg

OK - maybe I'm taking this too literally.  Does the VisIt_Bridge actually link against the VisIt libraries?    I built and compiled with the ENABLE_visitbridge turned on and I somehow ended up with a working CGNS reader.    But at no point did I specify any paths to my VisIt installation .....   8-)

I think the only extra flag will be make sure boost is one of the projects superbuild makes. When superbuild makes paraview it will see this and then turn visitbridge on and link it in when it configures paraview.

Robert probably knows best the state of this particular file format.

So, are there any additional parameters that need to be set, such as where the VisIt libraries are installed, etc?   In the Superbuild, I've looked in the CMakeCache.txt file, and I don't see any additional parameters for the bridge or for cgns.

Is this page still current and correct?   http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/VisIt_Database_Bridge#CGNS_Support

Rick,

Correct, VisItBridge is required for CGNS support. You can turn on
VisItBridge by using the ENABLE_visitbridge cmake option.

The VisIt Bridge comes with a subset of VisIt that it compiles and uses to
make VisIt Readers work instead of ParaView. The Bridge replicates how
VisIt loads files and maps that to the VTK pipeline stages.

Rick,

Yea, you don't need any separate build of VisIt, by turning on
ENABLE_visitbridge, ParaViewSuperbuild builds all the components
needed (including parts of VisIt). BTW, you don't neeed to ensure
ENABLE_boost is ON either (contrary to what Dave suggested). If
ENABLE_visitbridge is ON, ParaViewSuperbuid will automatically turn on
ENABLE_boost during its dependency determination pass.

I was thinking cross compilation. Where you need boost headers in the
compilation tools build and don't want to waste time building anything not
strictly necessary.

But otherwise yeah just turn on VisitBridge and that will in turn turn on
boost.

Sorry for the misinformation.

So, is there any value in this flag:

-DENABLE_cgns=ON 

if we're using the ENABLE_visitbridge flag?

Rick,

Yea, you don't need any separate build of VisIt, by turning on
ENABLE_visitbridge, ParaViewSuperbuild builds all the components
needed (including parts of VisIt). BTW, you don't neeed to ensure
ENABLE_boost is ON either (contrary to what Dave suggested). If
ENABLE_visitbridge is ON, ParaViewSuperbuid will automatically turn on
ENABLE_boost during its dependency determination pass.

If you enable visitbridge without enabling cgns we won't build the visit
cgns reader. This was done to allow people to selectively choose what
readers that require extra external libraries they wish to build.

If you enable visitbridge without enabling cgns we won't build the visit cgns reader. This was done to allow people to selectively choose what readers that require extra external libraries they wish to build.

Rick,

Yea, you don't need any separate build of VisIt, by turning on
ENABLE_visitbridge, ParaViewSuperbuild builds all the components
needed (including parts of VisIt). BTW, you don't neeed to ensure
ENABLE_boost is ON either (contrary to what Dave suggested). If
ENABLE_visitbridge is ON, ParaViewSuperbuid will automatically turn on
ENABLE_boost during its dependency determination pass.

So - if someone chooses to set the ENABLE_cgns flag (as I was doing) should the cmake rules automatically set the ENABLE_visitbridge flag?     I was setting the CGNS and assuming (without actually testing) that I was getting the cgns reader.

Is there a generally available reader for NASA's OVERFLOW CFD code?
A plugin perhaps?

I agree that CMake should do something when you turn on ENABLE_cgns.  I would advocate rather than blindly turning on ENABLE_visitbridge (which could have other consequences) that it instead outputs a warning explaining that ENABLE_cgns has no effect if ENABLE_visitbridge is off.

So - if someone chooses to set the ENABLE_cgns flag (as I was doing) should the cmake rules automatically set the ENABLE_visitbridge flag?     I was setting the CGNS and assuming (without actually testing) that I was getting the cgns reader.

If you enable visitbridge without enabling cgns we won't build the visit cgns reader. This was done to allow people to selectively choose what readers that require extra external libraries they wish to build.

Rick,

Yea, you don't need any separate build of VisIt, by turning on
ENABLE_visitbridge, ParaViewSuperbuild builds all the components
needed (including parts of VisIt). BTW, you don't neeed to ensure
ENABLE_boost is ON either (contrary to what Dave suggested). If
ENABLE_visitbridge is ON, ParaViewSuperbuid will automatically turn on
ENABLE_boost during its dependency determination pass.

Still no luck with this new issue, would it be easiest to make a new thread for this (the pastebin's are below) or keep it in here?

The issue is still a crash with my view.StillRender() but now it happens only when using mpirun and pvbatch. If i just use pvbatch without mpirun, the crash does not occur.

I went ahead and removed the servermanager.Connect() and that had no change.

What seems to be causing the issue is the view.StillRender() (and/or) view.WriteImage(...) and using mpirun with pvbatch.
(Code works fine when not using mpirun)

I hope someone more familiar with this can help.

Thanks,
~Brian

Hmm, haven't seen that one, but since it's a failed assertion, it may be
that you're attempting something that's not legit.

Are you running this using pvbatch? I don't think you need to call
Connect/Disconnect with pvbatch. Does removing those calls help?

You might also simplify and bulletproof your code by using the functions
in "simple.py" (see source tree). I'm not familiar enough with pv python
to say whether or not your doing something illegal in your code by
accessing servermanager directly.

Hi,

I don't know any ParaView reader that is specific to OVERFLOW but I know in
the past we've processed OVERFLOW results in ParaView. What are the output
formats for OVERFLOW? I'm guessing it probably outputs in one of the
Tecplot or Ensight formats which ParaView should be able to handle. A
non-comprehensive list of file formats that ParaView supports is available
at http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Users_Guide/List_of_readers.

If you send a small sample output file from OVERFLOW I can test opening it
up in ParaView.

Regards,
Andy

Subject: [Paraview] Contour over Mask Points
Message-ID: <CA+ze5C5gaN2+Y0iqJ8q_aVnfJwZJ193xKGnneFFrP1WHzKcn9Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am trying to create a contour over maskPoints filter.

So I have the following order.

1.Dataset
2. CellDatatoPointsData
3.MaskPoints
4.Contour

While Contour  works directly over cellDatatoPointsData, it doesn?t show
anything when i apply it over MaskPoints.

I wanted to apply Conour over maskPoints as my DataSet is so big and it
would crash when I wanted to make an animation of it.

any ideas how to fix this?

Thanks

Message-ID: <5204B754.3070505@surfsara.nl>

Hi folks,

Is it possible to write data to a parallel XML format (say, pvti) from 
pvbatch or pvpython? I can't seem to find the relevant classes 
vtkXMLP... under the paraview module. I found some older references to a 
module named paraview.vtk.io containing those classes, but that seems to 
be missing, at least in 3.98.1 and 4.0.1

Thanks,
Paul

Yup, that's doable, the following example works for me. if you haven't 
done so yet you might want to browse through the "simple.py" script. 
There are numerous helper functions defined and it also gives some idea 
about python capabilities and the underlying infrastructure.

from paraview.simple import *
ws=Wavelet()
Show(ws)
Render()
w=XMLPImageDataWriter()
w.FileName = 'test.pvti'
w.UpdatePipeline()

You could also use the CreateWriter(...) API to create the appropriate
writer: http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Python_Scripting#Writing_Data_Files_.28ParaView_3.9_or_later.29

As Burlen suggested, you can look at simple.py or refer to the
autogenerated Python documentation :

Here are the steps:

+ Open Data file, hit apply
+ Create calculator with the reader selected. set the StressXX expression,
hit apply
+ Create another calculator with the first calculator selected (this is
different from your state file). Set the StrainXX expression; hit apply
+ Create "Integrate Variables" filter with the second calculator selected.
Hit Apply. A spreadsheet view will be created with 1 row.
+ Select that 1 row my clicking on it. Now create "Plot Selection Over
Time" filter. Hit apply. That will show the plot over time. You can change
the variables plotted by using the Properties panel.

The attached video demonstrates the same.

Can you try using a simpler script as follows instead. Does that still
crash?

from paraview.simple import *
Sphere()
Show()
Render()

Hi Utkarsh,

The simple code you provided still crashes: http://paste.ubuntu.com/5967196/

Can you try using a simpler script as follows instead. Does that still crash?

from paraview.simple import *
Sphere()
Show()
Render()

I am not sure what could be going wrong. Try changing
the vtkPVClientServerSynchronizedRenderers::MasterEndRender() and
vtkPVClientServerSynchronizedRenderers::SlaveEndRender()  function calls to
print the following before the assert(). Let's figure out what class type
is it using.

cout << __LINE__ << ": ParallelController: " << (this->ParallelController?
this->ParallelController->GetClassName() : "none") << endl;

The file is
<ParaViewSource>/ParaViewCore/ClientServerCore/Rendering/vtkPVClientServerSynchronizedRenderers.cxx

Looks like you've turned off PARAVIEW_USE_ICE_T cmake flag. Any reason why?
That needs to be ON. Parallel rendering isn't supported without IceT.
That's what's causing the problems.

Hi Utkarsh,

That seems to be the fix. I had probably turned the flag off for some previous error that i've fixed since and never turned back on. I really appreciate your time.

Thanks,

Is it possible to load a file using pvpython, render the result, make a

Hi Utkarsh,

Thank you very much for the video and detailed instructions. It works fine
:)

One quick question: I found that the ensight case format does not support
the volume rendering.
Is there any filter or trick to plot the volume data ?

Warm regards,
Rakesh

Subject: [Paraview] Contour over large Dataset crashes
Message-ID: <CA+ze5C7fSDR0y-OgmGAd39saMdZ-npisPkHHQwVZfgB8cCDPiw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am trying to apply a contour filter over my dataset. So What I normally
do is to first apply a CellDataToPointData and then apply Contour over it.

As the Contour filter brings back many cells, ParaView crashes.

Is there any way to mask the whole DataSet and then apply Contour over it?

is there anyway to stop Contour or Isovolume to stop crashing ParaView when
I apply them over my DataSet?

Thanks

Subject: [Paraview] opening legacy vtk files
Message-ID: <CAOKat72vwGpy2ArY3KUb50z9YH7RyqSJEVnij4gkwjGHfpjrww@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I'm trying to open a series of .vtk files in Paraview such that
I can view an electromagnetic simulation in time.

When I try and open the .vtk files, I am confronted with a list of
possible file type readers to choose from, none of which is a
legacy vtk file reader!

Is it possible to open vtk files in Paraview?

I've tried using all versions from 3.10.1 to 4.01 and I have the same
issue with all of them! The operating system I am running Paraview
in is Linux, Ubuntu 13.04

Many Thanks for your help
Hayan

Hi,

ParaView is built on top of VTK so it can open legacy VTK files. I suspect
that the legacy VTK files got corrupted somehow. How were the files
created? Can you share one of the files so someone else can test it?

Regards,
Andy

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView Memory Usage
Message-ID: <CA+ze5C5zeswALYnB_tgADkSv4tnMOX0nDA_tSpZZu8VvPuji0g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have a question regarding memory efficiency in ParaView.

Consider that I have a h5 file that contain cellArrays that have
information about pH and lots of other materials over all cells in the
DataSet .

There are two ways I can use my h5 file in ParaView to visualize Data.
1.If I  open this file using ParaView and then under the properties section
just click to show pH.

2. If I split the h5 file and create a new Dataset just containing  pH and
NOT any other material and then open this file in ParaView.

It looks like in the first scenario ParaView is using way more memory than
when I split the file and open it in ParaView as a smaller Dataset.
Isn?t ParaView supposed to take care of memory better ? I mean shouldn?t
ParaView work the same way if I open my huge DataSet and try to show just
pH as when I extract pH from my DataSet and open it as a smaller h5 file in
ParaView?

I would be grateful if somebody could please give some advice.

Thanks in Advance

What file format was this? Xdmf? You're correct, typically, if a user
chooses to load only a certain array from the reader's properties panel,
that should be same/simlar to opening a file that does not have any of the
other arrays. There may a bug or things specific to the reader that may
preclude that.

Hi Utkarsh,

I am opening h5 files using PFlotran HDF5 reader to open my files which are
result of PFlotran simulation.

ParaView uses more memory when I load a big file with lots of arrays and
just select one array in reader?s properties panel than when I have
manually splitted my big file using python and then opening it in the same
reader and selecting the same array.

Is there anyway to fix this bug? This could make everything much faster.

Thanks in Advance

Subject: [Paraview] Unable to display points and lines
Message-ID: <20130812161013.256df551@ailurus>

Hi,

I'm having some trouble displaying the contents of the attached .vtu file (5 kB). In Spreadsheet View mode I can confirm that the file contains 32 lines and 64 points, however, nothing is displayed regardless of the Representation I pick. Adding filters such as a Glyph or 3D Delaunay does result in some visualization, but it should be possible to display just these line pieces, right?

By the way, I am using ParaView 4.0.1 64-bit on Linux.

Best,
Pieter

Subject: [Paraview] vtkStringArray and CopyStructure
Message-ID: <5208F323.80503@obs.ujf-grenoble.fr>

Hi,

I'm trying to pass string arrays stored in vtkPolyData sets through the 
pipeline, using Python programmable filters.
Below is a sample code :

In a ProgrammableSource1 :

    /output=self.GetOutput()/

    /
    /

    /points=vtk.vtkPoints()/

    /points.SetNumberOfPoints(1)/

    /points.SetPoint(0,0,0,0)/

    /
    /

    /stra=vtk.vtkStringArray()/

    /stra.SetName("hop")/

    /stra.Allocate(1)/

    /stra.InsertNextValue("hop")/

    /
    /

    /output.SetPoints(points)/

    /output.GetPointData().AddArray(stra)/

In a directly connected ProgrammableFilter1 :

/
//        input=self.GetInput()/

//

/output=self.GetOutput()/

//

/
/

//

/output.SetPoints(input.GetPoints())/

//

/output.GetPointData().CopyStructure(input.GetPointData())/

//

/
/

//

/print input.GetPointData().GetArray("hop")/


The result of the 'print' call at the end is "None", but should not be 
in my understanding. If we do the exact same thing with a 
vtkDoubleArray, it works.

Any idea on this issue ?

Thanks,

Yves

So that's where that class is :) I tried searching for the 
vtkXMLPImageDataWriter but didn't really find something useful. Great, 
got it working now! About the CreateWriter API, I did test it but was 
put on the wrong foot about a matching writer not being found, due to 
trying to write imagedata to .pvtp (silly mistake)

Thanks for the reply,
I have attached one of the files representing a frame from the
simulation.
The files would have been written by software designed in house at
my university.

If anyone could spot anything wrong with the file that would be greatly
appreciated.  It seems to conform with the legacy standard.

Many Thanks
Hayan

vtkStringArray derives directly from vtkAbstractArray and not vtkDataArray
so you need to use:
 *print input.GetPointData().GetAbstractArray("hop")*

Hi,

Attached is what I changed in order to get ParaView to load the file. Note
that VTK uses C indexing style (i.e. starting at 0). The CELL_TYPES array
shouldn't be removed. There were other changes as well so you should
probably do a diff on the two versions to figure out the difference.

Subject: [Paraview] NRRD space dimensions probem with Paraview
Message-ID: <91fc9dc7c2024556ae0fcac087df2762@BLUPR02MB178.namprd02.prod.outlook.com>

Dear Paraview community,

I am trying to use Paraview to render a volume composed of several slices acquired with a microscope.  Due to our method of data acquisition, the slices do not line up exactly.  They are skewed at a certain angle.  So the image stack is shaped like a parallelepiped rather than the conventional cuboid shape.  The nrrd file format seems like a good candidate to allow us to render these skewed volumes since nrrd allows one to relate data space with physical/global space by setting the "space directions" property in the nrrd header file (see below).

I have written the nrrd header file as below, but I cannot get Paraview to render the stack correctly.  It just renders the stacks in a cuboid shape as if I never even set the "space directions" property.  Have I written the header file incorrectly, or am I forgetting something?  Or maybe paraview cannot make use of this metadata?  I have double checked my geometry, and I believe that the space directions vectors are correct.

NRRD0005
type: uint16
data file: stack_2560_2160_200_uint16.raw
dimension: 3
sizes: 2560 2160 200
spacings:  .325 .325 5
space directions: (.325,0,0) (0,.2815,.1625) (0,-4.3301,2.5)
thicknesses: nan nan 5

Thanks for your help,

Subject: [Paraview] Oggtheora message while configuring ParaView
Message-ID: <52096530.7010906@indiana.edu>

Hello,

I'm working to configure (and then compile) ParaView on a new Cray HPC
system running a Cray version of Suse Enterprise Linux 11.

I am currently stuck with a series of errors that seem to be related
to "vtkoggtheora".  I'm happy to include that feature in ParaView if
I can get it to compile, but I'm just as happy to exclude it if that's
all that's getting in my way to getting ParaView compiled.

So two issues:

1) how to get rid of the errors?

2) how to disable inclusion of vtkoggtheora if I can't get rid of the
errors (I don't see a flag in the advanced list that obviously does this).


Here are the errors that I'm getting from the ccmake "configure" step:

---------

The Plot3D reader in 4.0 can read 32 bit and 64 bit Overflow files. Here
are the messages I sent to the Overflow mailing list a while ago:

Hi folks,

I am happy to report that there is now a robust Plot3D / Overflow reader in
ParaView that does automatic format detection for binary files. I am sorry
that it took this long. It was not the easiest reader to write. It works
with:

- Overflow files (any number of Q variables)
- Single and double precision real values
- C and Fortran output
- Big and little endian files
- ASCII and binary files
- Q file series for unsteady flows

I also developed a simple meta file format that supports xyz file series as
well as actual time values for each Q file (which is currently not
supported without the meta file - this is needed for accurate particle
advection). I am going to provide some documentation about this in the
ParaView Wiki soon.

You can test this out by downloading the development binaries:

Mac:
http://open.cdash.org/viewFiles.php?buildid=2873933
Linux:
http://open.cdash.org/viewFiles.php?buildid=2873792
Windows:
http://open.cdash.org/viewFiles.php?buildid=2873742

Please give it a try and let me know if you run into issues. If you would
like to wait for a stable release, ParaView 4.0 is scheduled to be released
early in May.

---------------------------------

I am happy to announce that ParaView now supports function files. There is
now support for pretty much the entire original Plot3D spec as well as
Overflow. Some of the new features are:

- Overflow files (any number of Q variables)
- Function files (any number of functions)
- Single and double precision real values
- C and Fortran output
- Big and little endian files
- ASCII and binary files
- XYZ and/or Q file series for unsteady flows and changing geometry
- More robust iblank support

XYZ file series require the use of a meta-file (p3d extension) as described
here:

http://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkPlot3DMetaReader.html#details



Best,
-berk

Subject: [Paraview] Visualisation of wind speed with isocurves
Message-ID: <CAJGHi7F_aZ25hDnj5XKjrkXvu_uJ_4Wsq9QaijaCPNQ0-KK8cA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi. I'm Architect who is learning about wind phenomena around buildings.
I've already run a wind simulation with OpenFoam using ODS-Studio and
I had some beautiful visualization with Paraview
My question is about how to visualise isocurves of shelter parameter
around the model like the picture (Fig.2) in this paper:
http://i.imgur.com/OmUXWWj.png

The paper is by Wisse, J. A. A Philosophy for Teaching Wind in the
Built Environment Energy and Buildings, 1988, 11, 157-161
http://www.sciencedirect.com/science...78778888900321

I would like to visualise similar isocurves representing the ratio of
wind speed around the model to the input wind speed. I don't have
clear idea how Paraview shows isocurves or isosurfaces in my
simulation. Apparently, it shows pressure, but I like areas showing a
ratio of speed.
Is it possible to set up Paraview for this kind of visualisation? I
don't know if my question makes sense (my English is second language).

Regards

Do you have a small foam file that you can share?

The trick will be to get both the initial wind vector and the converged
wind vector together in the same data set (ie from time = initial and time
= last). Once you do that you can use a calculator expression (or python
calculator expression) to get the magnitude of each and divide to get a
scalar field, which you can then contour.

Hello Alan,

I know it is been a while but I ran into this issue again today and I 
had a look into the problem again. It seems to be related to the time 
steps. I use the ensight gold transient single-file format. When I 
remove all time stepping information (i.e. BEGIN TIME STEP and END TIME 
STEP and everything related to it in the case file) and only visualize 
one single time step everything works fine. I simply cannot figure out 
what is going wrong. I appreciate any help in solving this issue.

Georg

Subject: [Paraview] How to find out what tick-boxes change in the execution
 of underlying vtk-filters?
Message-ID: <520A1B12.3000409@mh-hannover.de>

Dear mailing list members,


Using paraview's contour filter and switching off "Generate Triangles" creates a 
slightly different surface mesh that does not contain non-manifold edges. 
However vtkMarchingCubes does not seem to have any option concerning 
triangulation. How can I find out what the switch "Generate Triangles" in the 
GUI changes, i.e. how underlying vtk-filters are called differently?
When I searched through the paraview sources for the string "Generate Triangles" 
I didn't get any fitting hits.

Any help or hints are very much appreciated
Roman

Subject: [Paraview] How to efficiently "clip" a voxel dataset for volume
	rendering
Message-ID: <520A197C.40506@mh-hannover.de>

Dear mailing list members,


Is there a better way (taking less render time) to clip a voxel dataset along an 
arbitrarily oriented plane in paraview than using the clip-filter? It works find 
as long as no volume rendering is chosen as the displaying method but when I 
change to volume rendering it takes more than a day what before took only a minute.
My guess is, that the change of the type of the dataset caused by the 
clip-filter (output is unstructured grid) is not as efficiently rendered as 
vtkImage. For my purpose it would be sufficient to not clip intersected voxel 
themselves, just not to render those on one side of the clipping plane.
Is there any way to achieve that with existing paraview or vtk-filters?
If not should I use vtkImplicitFunctionToImageStencil in a plugin to create a 
mask image from an interactive plane-widget and then render e.g. black transparent?

Any help or hints are very much appreciated
Roman

Message-ID: <CA+TOSGctxs3RkQF8_aCvyW=g6Ee5PG0Ns8p0neYsjjvmvTETwg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

i have been using a python script to read and export multiple csv files.
The first world problem here is that I would like those files to have no
headers, I would normally use a bash script to remove the headers for me
but I really wanted to know if it was possible to get rid of the middle man
and simply do away with the headers without the bash script.

Thanks in advance.


Best regards,

Is this due to the difference between points and vertices? I found a page (http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/User_Created_Plugins) which mentions the conversion of points to vertices, but I'm having some problems with compiling this plugin. Are there any other methods resulting in ParaView visualizing the points and lines from my .vtu file (attached to the previous mail)?

Points are the locations in space, cells are regions of space defined by
some number of points. VTK draws cells (ex. tetrahedra, quads, triangles,
and vertices), not points. A vertex is a cell defined by exactly one
point. To make vertex cells from any data set, apply the glyph filter with
glyph type 2D Glypt, Vertex.

Your data set has line type cells, but the points that define the lines are
coincident. Use the spreadsheet view to confirm.
Ex cell 0 consists of points 0 and 1, but if you look at the point data you
will see that points 0 and 1 are both:
0.3753 -1.15505 0.222222
0.3753 -1.15505 0.222222

Hi,

Ah, you're right! Seems to be another bug in the code which outputs this .vtu file... Thanks, I'll try to fix it.

Yes it is.

In the GUI, use Tools->Trace to have the GUI create the script for you. Or
read http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Python_Scripting to learn the syntax
yourself if you prefer.

In either case a minimal script comes down to:

from paraview.simple import *
OpenDataFile(?can.ex2?)
Show()
Render()
WriteImage("can.png")

Berk:

I really appreciate your response, but it is still not working for us.
We produce 64-bit OVERFLOW grid and q files and are trying to visualize
them using ParaView 4.0.1.  The grid files are read without any problem.
However any attempt to read the q files produces errors.

On Windows 32-bit:

ERROR: In C:\DBD\pvs-x32\paraview\src\paraview\VTK\Common\ExecutionModel\vtkExecutive.cxx, line 754

This error occurs immediately after selecting the q file.

If we then persist and hit the "Apply" button, the following error
message pops up:

We get the same type results on Linux 64-bit systems.

Any recommendations would be appreciated!  Thanks!!

Subject: Re: [Paraview] NASA OVERFLOW reader

The Plot3D reader in 4.0 can read 32 bit and 64 bit Overflow files. Here are the messages I sent to the Overflow mailing list a while ago:

Hi folks,

I am happy to report that there is now a robust Plot3D / Overflow reader in ParaView that does automatic format detection for binary files. I am sorry that it took this long. It was not the easiest reader to write. It works with:

- Overflow files (any number of Q variables)
- Single and double precision real values
- C and Fortran output
- Big and little endian files
- ASCII and binary files
- Q file series for unsteady flows

I also developed a simple meta file format that supports xyz file series as well as actual time values for each Q file (which is currently not supported without the meta file - this is needed for accurate particle advection). I am going to provide some documentation about this in the ParaView Wiki soon.

You can test this out by downloading the development binaries:

Mac:
http://open.cdash.org/viewFiles.php?buildid=2873933
Linux:
http://open.cdash.org/viewFiles.php?buildid=2873792
Windows:
http://open.cdash.org/viewFiles.php?buildid=2873742

Please give it a try and let me know if you run into issues. If you would like to wait for a stable release, ParaView 4.0 is scheduled to be released early in May.

---------------------------------

I am happy to announce that ParaView now supports function files. There is now support for pretty much the entire original Plot3D spec as well as Overflow. Some of the new features are:

- Overflow files (any number of Q variables)
- Function files (any number of functions)
- Single and double precision real values
- C and Fortran output
- Big and little endian files
- ASCII and binary files
- XYZ and/or Q file series for unsteady flows and changing geometry
- More robust iblank support

XYZ file series require the use of a meta-file (p3d extension) as described here:

Best,

In-Reply-To: <91fc9dc7c2024556ae0fcac087df2762@BLUPR02MB178.namprd02.prod.outlook.com>
Message-ID: <CE2FBAA1.F2D3%kmorel@sandia.gov>

Cody,

Unfortunately, ParaView's NRRD reader does not support the space directions parameter in the way you want to use it. The data type the NRRD reader produces (a vtkImageData) only supports axis-aligned points, so only the magnitudes of the space directions are used. For the NRRD reader to produce another data type that supports more arbitrary point positions would break other code that relies on the NRRD reader.

Here is a workaround that, although tiresome, should work for your problem.

1. Remove both the "spacings" and the "space directions" field. Load that into ParaView. (The data will be scaled by 1 on each axis).
2. Apply the "Image Data to Point Set" filter on the NRRD data.
3. Add the "Calculator" filter to the Image Data to Point Set filter. Turn on the "Coordinate Results" option (it is an advanced option), and set the equation to the following string: "coordsX*(.325*iHat) + coordsY*(.2815*jHat+.1625*kHat) + coordsZ*(-4.3301*jHat + 2.5*kHat)".

Once you apply the Calculator filter, the data should be scaled and skewed how you want it.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [Paraview] NRRD space dimensions probem with Paraview

Dear Paraview community,

I am trying to use Paraview to render a volume composed of several slices acquired with a microscope.  Due to our method of data acquisition, the slices do not line up exactly.  They are skewed at a certain angle.  So the image stack is shaped like a parallelepiped rather than the conventional cuboid shape.  The nrrd file format seems like a good candidate to allow us to render these skewed volumes since nrrd allows one to relate data space with physical/global space by setting the "space directions" property in the nrrd header file (see below).

I have written the nrrd header file as below, but I cannot get Paraview to render the stack correctly.  It just renders the stacks in a cuboid shape as if I never even set the "space directions" property.  Have I written the header file incorrectly, or am I forgetting something?  Or maybe paraview cannot make use of this metadata?  I have double checked my geometry, and I believe that the space directions vectors are correct.

NRRD0005
type: uint16
data file: stack_2560_2160_200_uint16.raw
dimension: 3
sizes: 2560 2160 200
spacings:  .325 .325 5
space directions: (.325,0,0) (0,.2815,.1625) (0,-4.3301,2.5)
thicknesses: nan nan 5
encoding: raw
endian: little

Thanks for your help,

Hello Alan,

I know it is been a while but I ran into this issue again today and I had a look into the problem again. It seems to be related to the time steps. I use the ensight gold transient single-file format. When I remove all time stepping information (i.e. BEGIN TIME STEP and END TIME STEP and everything related to it in the case file) and only visualize one single time step everything works fine. I simply cannot figure out what is going wrong. I appreciate any help in solving this issue.

Georg

Looks like CHECK_TYPE_SIZE(..) calls made by cmake to discover various
type sizes just fails (not just for OggTheora but also for HDF5 and
IceT).  To confirm that, try running cmake on the attached
CMakeLists.txt as

> cd <TMP_BUILD_DIR>
> ccmake  ..../<DIR containing the attached CMakeLists.txt>

What does it print out (ensure correct compiler is being used)? For me
it prints the following message:

HAVE_VTKOGGTHEORA_INT16_T=TRUE
     VTKOGGTHEORA_INT16_T=2

HAVE_VTKOGGTHEORA_INT=TRUE

Hi Ken,

Thanks very much for your prompt reply!  I implemented your workaround and it seems to be working well.  I just have one further question:  Does this technique involve any resampling of the pixel values?  We want to avoid resampling in order to keep the best image quality possible.  The filter combination that you suggest seems to avoid resampling, but do you know whether the final rendering stage resorts to resampling?  In other words, does the renderer use interpolation to force points to be aligned across slices?

Thanks,
Cody

Subject: Re: [Paraview] NRRD space dimensions probem with Paraview

Cody,

Unfortunately, ParaView's NRRD reader does not support the space directions parameter in the way you want to use it. The data type the NRRD reader produces (a vtkImageData) only supports axis-aligned points, so only the magnitudes of the space directions are used. For the NRRD reader to produce another data type that supports more arbitrary point positions would break other code that relies on the NRRD reader.

Here is a workaround that, although tiresome, should work for your problem.

1. Remove both the "spacings" and the "space directions" field. Load that into ParaView. (The data will be scaled by 1 on each axis).
2. Apply the "Image Data to Point Set" filter on the NRRD data.
3. Add the "Calculator" filter to the Image Data to Point Set filter. Turn on the "Coordinate Results" option (it is an advanced option), and set the equation to the following string: "coordsX*(.325*iHat) + coordsY*(.2815*jHat+.1625*kHat) + coordsZ*(-4.3301*jHat + 2.5*kHat)".

Once you apply the Calculator filter, the data should be scaled and skewed how you want it.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [Paraview] NRRD space dimensions probem with Paraview

Dear Paraview community,

I am trying to use Paraview to render a volume composed of several slices acquired with a microscope.  Due to our method of data acquisition, the slices do not line up exactly.  They are skewed at a certain angle.  So the image stack is shaped like a parallelepiped rather than the conventional cuboid shape.  The nrrd file format seems like a good candidate to allow us to render these skewed volumes since nrrd allows one to relate data space with physical/global space by setting the "space directions" property in the nrrd header file (see below).

I have written the nrrd header file as below, but I cannot get Paraview to render the stack correctly.  It just renders the stacks in a cuboid shape as if I never even set the "space directions" property.  Have I written the header file incorrectly, or am I forgetting something?  Or maybe paraview cannot make use of this metadata?  I have double checked my geometry, and I believe that the space directions vectors are correct.

NRRD0005
type: uint16
data file: stack_2560_2160_200_uint16.raw
dimension: 3
sizes: 2560 2160 200
spacings:  .325 .325 5
space directions: (.325,0,0) (0,.2815,.1625) (0,-4.3301,2.5)
thicknesses: nan nan 5
encoding: raw
endian: little

Thanks for your help,

No, the data is not resampled. The correct scalar values are placed on the transformed points and then the scalars are interpolated between the points for locations inside the cells.

The filter combination that you suggest seems to avoid resampling, but do you know whether the final rendering stage resorts to resampling?  In other words, does the renderer use interpolation to force points to be aligned across slices?

Thanks,

Subject: Re: [Paraview] NRRD space dimensions probem with Paraview

Cody,

Unfortunately, ParaView's NRRD reader does not support the space directions parameter in the way you want to use it. The data type the NRRD reader produces (a vtkImageData) only supports axis-aligned points, so only the magnitudes of the space directions are used. For the NRRD reader to produce another data type that supports more arbitrary point positions would break other code that relies on the NRRD reader.

Here is a workaround that, although tiresome, should work for your problem.

1. Remove both the "spacings" and the "space directions" field. Load that into ParaView. (The data will be scaled by 1 on each axis).
2. Apply the "Image Data to Point Set" filter on the NRRD data.
3. Add the "Calculator" filter to the Image Data to Point Set filter. Turn on the "Coordinate Results" option (it is an advanced option), and set the equation to the following string: "coordsX*(.325*iHat) + coordsY*(.2815*jHat+.1625*kHat) + coordsZ*(-4.3301*jHat + 2.5*kHat)".

Once you apply the Calculator filter, the data should be scaled and skewed how you want it.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [Paraview] NRRD space dimensions probem with Paraview

Dear Paraview community,

I am trying to use Paraview to render a volume composed of several slices acquired with a microscope.  Due to our method of data acquisition, the slices do not line up exactly.  They are skewed at a certain angle.  So the image stack is shaped like a parallelepiped rather than the conventional cuboid shape.  The nrrd file format seems like a good candidate to allow us to render these skewed volumes since nrrd allows one to relate data space with physical/global space by setting the "space directions" property in the nrrd header file (see below).

I have written the nrrd header file as below, but I cannot get Paraview to render the stack correctly.  It just renders the stacks in a cuboid shape as if I never even set the "space directions" property.  Have I written the header file incorrectly, or am I forgetting something?  Or maybe paraview cannot make use of this metadata?  I have double checked my geometry, and I believe that the space directions vectors are correct.

This should work nicely then.  Thank you very much, Ken!

No, the data is not resampled. The correct scalar values are placed on the transformed points and then the scalars are interpolated between the points for locations inside the cells.

I use the ensight gold transient single-file format. When I remove all time stepping information (i.e. BEGIN TIME STEP and END TIME STEP and everything related to it in the case file) and only visualize one single time step everything works fine. I simply cannot figure out what is going wrong. I appreciate any help in solving this issue.

Subject: [Paraview] Resample data to uniform grid
Message-ID: <8DE8241760B04B289EF98CE11994E3DC@BlackMonster>

Hi,

I have several VTK files with 2D, time dependent data (each file is a time-step).
When I open these files with ParaView, it tells me that the data is in an unstructured grid.

Now I want to convert my data into a uniform grid, preferably in a way that instead of having 
a single file for each time-step, they are ordered along the z-axis. (i.e. a volume where the 
z-axis encodes time)

What is the best/easiest way to get this done?


Best,
Gebhard

Dear mailing list members,


I managed to write c++ vtk-program that uses vtkImplicitFunctionToImageStencil 
to "clip" image data. However one needs to copy past the origin and normal 
coordinates of e.g. a clipping plane in paraview to the cli command. Therefore 
I'd like to integrate this as a plugin into paraview using the 
vtkImplicitPlaneWidget as a direct interaction method.
Now, I wonder if there is a way to write an XML-only paraview plug-in that uses 
e.g. a vtkImplicitPlaneWidget as input to a chain of vtk-filters? I.e. would it 
be possible to write an XML-plug-in that would give the same functionality as 
the paraview clip-filter or would it have to be a c++ based plugin?
It seems there is no plug-in in the paraview XML-plugin list that uses a 
vtkImplicitPlaneWidget nor could I find any instruction on that in the plugin howto.

Any help or hints are very much appreciated
Roman

Message-ID: <520B95FD.5080305@mh-hannover.de>

Dear mailing list members,


Is it somehow possible to export selection labels (created with the Selection 
Inspector) to an SVG as editable/movable text-objects? When I use Export Scene 
from the File-menu the labels are not exported. When I save a screenshot, they 
are exported but of course cannot be edited/repositioned.
Or is there any other way to display labels to polydata points (from point data) 
such that overlapping labels can be avoided or manually repositioned? I found 
many vtk*label* or vtk*text* filter but none seems to do this from what the 
description says.

Any help or hints are very much appreciated
Roman

Can you post the current XML for the filter? I think I can update that
to add logic for the widget.

Okay, done.

I should probably mention (if I haven't already) that this is being done
under the Cray version of SUSE enterprise Linux for a Cray XE/XK7 system
(along the lines of Blue Waters and Titan).

And I tested it twice, once with the Cray compiler, and then again with
the GNU compiler.  Both times I got the exact same result as you report
here:

Are you aware of anyone at NCSA or Oak Ridge that have had success
on their Cray systems?

What should I try next?

	Thanks,

Do you have a sample dataset you could share (feel free to email me
privately). I at the very least track down what the reader is doing.

Hey Bill,

I've built ParaView on Crays (including Titan).

The approach I recommend is cross compilation. See the Mastering CMake book
chapter 8 for the details. The approach works for Crays and BlueGenes at
least as far back as XT3 and BG/L.

It boils down to building twice, once on and for the login nodes, and then
again on the login nodes but for the compute nodes.
The first pass just builds the tools that make uses when you compile
Paraview (like the protoc compiler). The second pass uses those tools and a
file with the necessary TryRunResults containing answers to the things that
the front end build can not determine
(like HDF5_PRINTF_LL_TEST_RUN__TRYRUN_OUTPUT) to build a ParaView that will
run on the compute nodes.

Yes it can be just as much fun as that sounds!

Lucky for you we've packaged up the whole thing in ParaViewSuperbuild
(git://paraview.org/ParaViewSuperbuild.git). Superbuild does all of the
above and builds ParaView's dependencies at the same time (osmesa, python).

To use it on Titan for instance, first source something like this in a
"tools" directory to setup the tools build pass

titan/v4.0.1> cat configtools.sh
#use my own cmake, system one is too old
setenv PATH
/autofs/na4_proj/csc035/demarle/pvdev/titan/cmake-build/bin:${PATH}
#switch compiler to compile code for front end
module unload PrgEnv-pgi
module load gcc
#configure settings for to build compile tools only
cmake \
  -DCROSS_BUILD_STAGE:STRING=TOOLS -Dcross_target:STRING=xk7_gnu \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Release \
  -DBUILD_TESTING:BOOL=FALSE \
  -DParaView_FROM_GIT:BOOL=OFF \
  -DENABLE_paraview:BOOL=TRUE \
  -DENABLE_boost:BOOL=TRUE \
  -DENABLE_python:BOOL=TRUE \
  -DENABLE_portfwd:BOOL=FALSE \
  ../../ParaviewSuperbuild

than type make.

Next source something like this to setup the cross build pass in a "cross"
directory.

titan/v4.0.1> cat configcross.sh
#use my own cmake, system one is too old
setenv PATH
/autofs/na4_proj/csc035/demarle/pvdev/titan/cmake-build/bin:${PATH}
#switch compiler to compile code for back end
module unload PrgEnv-pgi
module unload gcc
module load PrgEnv-gnu
#not sure why module load wasn't sufficient, but ended up needing to force
#cmake to choose the right compiler
setenv CC /opt/cray/xt-asyncpe/5.17/bin/cc
setenv CXX /opt/cray/xt-asyncpe/5.17/bin/CC
#configure settings to cross compile python, (mesa - implied), and paraview
cmake \
  -DCROSS_BUILD_STAGE:STRING=CROSS -Dcross_target:STRING=xk7_gnu \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Release \
  -DBUILD_TESTING:BOOL=TRUE \
  -DParaView_FROM_GIT:BOOL=OFF \
  -DENABLE_paraview:BOOL=TRUE \
  -DENABLE_python:BOOL=TRUE \
  ../../ParaviewSuperbuild

than type make.

The cross built binary will end up in paraview/src/paraview-bld. You will
need to put the binaries and the python libs and paraview python modules
somewhere on the parallel file system in order to run it. I recommend
against building directly on the parallel file system as that slows down
the build immensely.

CMake Error at VTK/CMake/vtkModuleTop.cmake:29 (message):
   No such module "vtkChartsCore" needed by "vtkPVServerManagerApplication"
   Call Stack (most recent call first):
   VTK/CMake/vtkModuleTop.cmake:45 (vtk_module_check)
   VTK/CMake/vtkModuleTop.cmake:52 (vtk_module_check)
   VTK/CMakeLists.txt:348 (include)

Is all of the necessary VTK with the Catalyst tarball, or do I need to have a separate VTK build?

Thanks,
Mark

Mark,

No, you wouldn't need to use any external VTK. I've posted an updated
tarball. Feel free to give that a try. Also, how are you starting the
build? Using cmake.sh script included in the package?

Utkarsh,
I was just running ccmake, I read the wiki as cmake.sh was for building Catalyst from the ParaView source tree. I'll try the cmake.sh with the new tarball and report back.

Subject: [Paraview] exporting selection labels to an SVG as
 editable/movable text-objects

Hi Dr. Grothausmann,

This is currently not possible. Some portions of VTK/ParaView still
use methods of drawing text that are not fully compatible with the
GL2PS export mechanism, and unfortunately the selection label renderer
is one of them.

I'll take a look at this case and fix it for the next release. I've
opened a bug report for the issue:

http://paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=14231

In the meantime, the best solution I can come up with is to manually
add a text source with appropriate text for the labels you care about.
This will be tedious for a large number of labels, but will allow
finer control over label positioning.

Thanks for the report,
Dave

Cool. Most of them just ended up being fixed, so I didn't have to do
anything extra :). Thanks for your inputs on the design. I think it's
definitely cleaner than before.

Are there any filter or trick to plot the volume results?

You mean how to volume render?  On the properties tab, there is a tab that says "Solid Color".  Change that to one of your variables.  Next, where it says Representation - and after that Solid or Outline, change that to volume.

Okay, I was able to compile and run a Fortran code using the FortranAdaptorAPI and I'm getting some errors. (I had this code working with coprocessing and ParaView 3.14.1, so in theory it should still work).

Error: Could not import vtkCommonComputationalGeometryPython
Error: Could not import vtkCommonMiscPython
Error: Could not import vtkCommonSystemPython
Error: Could not import vtkRenderingCorePython
Error: Could not import vtkFiltersCore
Error: Cannot import vtkPVServerManagerDefaultPython
Error: Cannot import vtkPVServerManagerRenderingPython
Error: Cannot import vtkPVServerManagerApplicationPython
Error: Could not create TimeKeeper
Error: Could not create AnimationScene

How do I get Catalyst to import these? Is it just a matter of setting $PYTHONPATH?

Hi Mark

The environment should be set up automatically for you such that it can
find these modules. Can you share your adaptor code and Python code? You
could try the Fortran90 example at
https://github.com/acbauer/CatalystExampleCode to see how that behaves.

Regards,
Andy

These are more of warning than errors. Catalyst can be thought of as a
stripped down ParaView. Several modules/components are removed to keep
the package small. There will be several "editions" of catalyst based
on which components they contain. The idea is one decides which
filters/components they are interested in using in-situ. Then we can
create a custom edition containing only those filters and the
components needed to get those filters working. This is to keep the
library size small for production runs. For testing, ParaView itself
includes the library against which the simulation adaptors can link.
Thus one can create/test adaptors using a regular ParaView itself.
That will have all the modules ParaView includes and hence one can
experiment with the which filters to use and pick to come up with the
short list of filters that can then be used to create a custom
edition. Within the next week or so, we are will have a couple more
editions available that will include some of the commonly used
filters.

Hope that clarifies things  a bit. FYI, there's a user's guide
available too that may help clarify this:

Utkarsh,

Is it worth the trouble to get rid of these error messages in Catalyst?

Also, the most up-to-date version of the user's guide is at
http://paraview.org/Wiki/images/4/48/CatalystUsersGuide.pdf.

Dear Dave,


Many thanks for Your reply and for opening a bug report. I wonder if it would be 
possible to extend the glyph filter to allow rendering text labels as "glyphs" 
because the Selection Inspector labelling cannot be save in a state file. If I 
do so and want to reload it I get the message:

ERROR: In 
/home/utkarsh/Dashboards/MyTests/NightlyMaster/ParaViewSuperbuild-Release/paraview/src/paraview/VTK/IO/XMLParser/vtkXMLParser.cxx, 
line 483
vtkPVXMLParser (0x40172f0): Error parsing XML in stream at line 4409, column 38, 
byte index 217112: not well-formed (invalid token)

Root does not exist. Either state file could not be opened or it does not 
contain valid xml
Case not handled.


I guess though that the problem with the export to vector-graphics would remain 
the same.

Many thanks for Your help
Roman

Thank You for Your reply. Well, I already got stuck trying to translate my C++ 
programme into XML. Below is The C++ code but I could not find an example how to 
connect a series of VTK-filters in XML-syntax. Is that possible at all or should 
I translate the C-code to python? The idea is to create a plug-in that does not 
need compiling paraview from source.

Many thanks for Your help

Hi Andy and Utkarsh,
I'm not sure I can share the original code, so I tried the GitHub example Andy linked. I configured it to use the Catalyst build directory for ParaView_DIR. I still get the import errors, which I see I can ignore, but then also

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 2, in <module>
  File "coproc.py", line 74, in DoCoProcessing
    coprocessor.UpdateProducers(datadescription)
  File "/home/mvanmoer/builds/Catalyst/1.0.alpha-build/lib/site-packages/paraview/coprocessing.py", line 102, in UpdateProducers
    self.CreatePipeline(datadescription)
  File "coproc.py", line 30, in CreatePipeline
    self.Pipeline = _CreatePipeline(self, datadescription)
  File "coproc.py", line 16, in _CreatePipeline
    class Pipeline:
  File "coproc.py", line 19, in Pipeline
    Slice1 = Slice( guiName="Slice1", Crinkleslice=0, SliceOffsetValues=[0.0], Triangulatetheslice=1, SliceType="Plane" )
NameError: name 'Slice' is not defined

Okay, is this because of what you're talking about below, Utkarsh?  That the Catalyst build won't necessarily have any particular filter in it, I'd have to specify what I need in the cmake.sh ahead of time?

Utkarsh,

Is it worth the trouble to get rid of these error messages in Catalyst?
Also, the most up-to-date version of the user's guide is at http://paraview.org/Wiki/images/4/48/CatalystUsersGuide.pdf.

These are more of warning than errors. Catalyst can be thought of as a
stripped down ParaView. Several modules/components are removed to keep
the package small. There will be several "editions" of catalyst based
on which components they contain. The idea is one decides which
filters/components they are interested in using in-situ. Then we can
create a custom edition containing only those filters and the
components needed to get those filters working. This is to keep the
library size small for production runs. For testing, ParaView itself
includes the library against which the simulation adaptors can link.
Thus one can create/test adaptors using a regular ParaView itself.
That will have all the modules ParaView includes and hence one can
experiment with the which filters to use and pick to come up with the
short list of filters that can then be used to create a custom
edition. Within the next week or so, we are will have a couple more
editions available that will include some of the commonly used
filters.

Hope that clarifies things  a bit. FYI, there's a user's guide
available too that may help clarify this:

Mark,

That is correct. The edition you're trying (which is a very
basic/minimal edition) doesn't have Slice filter in it and hence it
fails. Another editions is currently under works (called the Catalyst
Essenstials) which will include the Slice filter.

Ben, do you have an ETA when that'll be merged into ParaView git?

Mark, the creation of editions is not by editing the cmake.sh file,
but you running Python script in ParaView source. Creating new
editions is a little tedious and I am not sure we want to suggest that
to users. The idea is that there will a collection of editions that
should suffice typical use-cases and for anything more custom, the
ParaView team could help with the creation on new editions. In your
case, I think  the Essenstials edition currently under development may
work.

Hi Mark,

In the base edition of my version the only filter that I see that works is
the Contour filter. If you use the coproc.py script for co-processing
script and replace FECxxAdaptor.cxx you should be able to get it to run
properly. The results will be garbage but it will produce a pvtp file.

As for how to enable other filters in your build of Catalyst, that should
be in section 4 of the user's guide or in
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Generating_Catalyst_Source_Tree. The cmake.sh
file is just a simplified build script and doesn't do anything as far as
enabling extra filters by itself.

Andy

Hi,

I have just started with ParaView 4.0.1 and keep getting weird behaviour
from the display where by it keeps going yellow. The behaviour is similar
to that mentioned in this email to the list.

http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2013-July/028717.html

Was there any follow up to this?

It's not clear what could be causing the problem, esp since we haven't
been able to reproduce it here. If you don;t mind building ParaView
from source and use git-bisect to track down the commit that could
have cause this issue, I can provide you details on how to do it.

Georg,
I am pretty sure this is a ParaView bug.  It works local server, but doesn't work remote server.  It also works with EnSight.

Although I will poke at it for a while longer, mind if I write up a bug with Kitware, using your files?  They show the bug well.

Alan

I use the ensight gold transient single-file format. When I remove all time stepping information (i.e. BEGIN TIME STEP and END TIME STEP and everything related to it in the case file) and only visualize one single time step everything works fine. I simply cannot figure out what is going wrong. I appreciate any help in solving this issue.

Please send it directly to me. Are these from stock OVERFLOW?

Hello Alan,

sure, please feel free to use my files for writing a bug report.

And thanks again for having a look at the problem.

I use the ensight gold transient single-file format. When I remove all time stepping information (i.e. BEGIN TIME STEP and END TIME STEP and everything related to it in the case file) and only visualize one single time step everything works fine. I simply cannot figure out what is going wrong. I appreciate any help in solving this issue.

Subject: [Paraview] make install breaks pvpython on MacOSX
Message-ID: <DA0F3834-EF7A-4E1F-AD6A-6576BDE9C1D3@kit.edu>

Hi everyone,

I built ParaView locally from the current source tree (4.0.1) with PARAVIEW_ENABLE_PYTHON set to ON in CMake. When calling pvpython in the build directory, importing paraview.simple works fine. However, this is not the case after running make install and calling pvpython from the paraview.app/Contents/bin directory.

>>> from paraview import simple
Traceback (most recent call last):
 File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ImportError: No module named paraview

I can fix this by manually setting the environment variable PYTHONPATH to include paraview.app/Contents/Python and paraview.app/Contents/Libraries
However, http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Python_Scripting#Getting_Started states that setting PYTHONPATH manually should not be required when using pvpython which is indeed the case for the prebuilt binary package.

Did I miss to set a CMake flag appropriately? Everything a search related to this issue brought up was setting PYTHONPATH manually which I feel can't be the only solution.

The output of sys.path from pvpython in the build directory and in the .app package produced by make install is as follows:

ParaView-bin2/bin/pvpython:
['', '/Volumes/pommard/Benutzer/al128/usr/build/ParaView-bin2/lib/site-packages', '/Volumes/pommard/Benutzer/al128/usr/build/ParaView-bin2/lib', '/opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python27.zip', '/opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7', '/opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/plat-darwin', '/opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/plat-mac', '/opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/plat-mac/lib-scriptpackages', '/opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/lib-tk', '/opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/lib-old', '/opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/lib-dynload', '/Volumes/pommard/Benutzer/al128/Library/Python/2.7/lib/python/site-packages', '/opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/site-packages', '/opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/site-packages/PyObjC', '/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages']

To me it looks like pvpython in the .app package does not append paraview.app/Contents/Python and paraview.app/Contents/Libraries to the path while pvpython in the build directory appends to corresponding folders
ParaView-bin2/lib/site-packages and ParaView-bin2/lib for some reason.

Any help regarding a solution without setting PYTHONPATH manually is greatly appreciated!

Best,

Subject: [Paraview] Removing support for legacy properties/display panels
	from ParaView
Message-ID: <CADHSJjAoPRjjpbmtzo-S2xaEZgJRjc+97VyKh5wSrd73euHwwQ@mail.gmail.com>

I recently posted to this email to paraview-developers list, only to
realize that there may be plugin developers who are not subscribed to
that list, hence I am reposting it here.

The original email was as under. One can follow the original thread
here: http://public.kitware.com/pipermail/paraview-developers/2013-August/002421.html

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Folks,

I wanted to get a feel for what people think about removing the
support for old style panels from the next release of ParaView. The
new panels have been around for 3 releases now (since Dec 2012). We
are working on several cleanups to domains and other server manager
level components to better integrate with Python and it would be nice
to get rid of some of these obsolete components (which are quite a few
classes that are now primarily unused).

The next release is being targeted for Oct/Nov time frame.

Hi Andy and Utkarsh,

Okay, so for the time being I decided to work with a fully blown Catalyst out of the ParaView src until I get my head around making editions. This allowed me to get the GitHub F90 example. However, with the original simulation, I have a different issue, which I'll start in a new thread.

Thanks,
Mark

Hi Mark,

In the base edition of my version the only filter that I see that works is the Contour filter. If you use the coproc.py script for co-processing script and replace FECxxAdaptor.cxx you should be able to get it to run properly. The results will be garbage but it will produce a pvtp file.

As for how to enable other filters in your build of Catalyst, that should be in section 4 of the user's guide or in http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Generating_Catalyst_Source_Tree. The cmake.sh file is just a simplified build script and doesn't do anything as far as enabling extra filters by itself.

Hi Andy and Utkarsh,
I'm not sure I can share the original code, so I tried the GitHub example Andy linked. I configured it to use the Catalyst build directory for ParaView_DIR. I still get the import errors, which I see I can ignore, but then also

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 2, in <module>

NameError: name 'Slice' is not defined

Okay, is this because of what you're talking about below, Utkarsh?  That the Catalyst build won't necessarily have any particular filter in it, I'd have to specify what I need in the cmake.sh ahead of time?

Utkarsh,

Is it worth the trouble to get rid of these error messages in Catalyst?
Also, the most up-to-date version of the user's guide is at http://paraview.org/Wiki/images/4/48/CatalystUsersGuide.pdf.

create a custom edition containing only those filters and the

library size small for production runs. For testing, ParaView itself
includes the library against which the simulation adaptors can link.
Thus one can create/test adaptors using a regular ParaView itself.
That will have all the modules ParaView includes and hence one can
experiment with the which filters to use and pick to come up with the
short list of filters that can then be used to create a custom
edition. Within the next week or so, we are will have a couple more
editions available that will include some of the commonly used
filters.

Hope that clarifies things  a bit. FYI, there's a user's guide
available too that may help clarify this:

Sounds good. Yea, using full ParaView to get off the ground may indeed
be the best approach. Once you start doing production runs, the
Editions would come in handy.

Subject: [Paraview] can vtkImplicitPlaneWidget be used in an XML-only

Roman,

As I was working on the XML, it occurred to me that unfortunately this
cannot work in ParaView currently. The reason being that the VTK
module that contains the Image stencil classes is not enabled in the
default ParaView build. Also, there seem to be other issues with using
Image Stencils due to the general lack of support for the same in
ParaView. It will need some work to clean that up. I'm reporting a
bug: http://paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=14236

Subject: [Paraview] catalyst/copro ignoring camera position in exported
	python pipeline?
Message-ID: <7F781841FF1E044388AFA42B70703A7A766A3C27@CHIMBX6.ad.uillinois.edu>

Hello, is there a way to set up a coprocessing adaptor to work with RAW binary files? What I've done in the past is to first load a RAW binary in the GUI and export a coprocessing script to save a vti, run the simulation a single timestep writing the vti, then load that and save another script to create images from the full simulation.

I tried skipping the write to vti step and instead have the render-to-image script based on the RAW binary source. Attached is what I get, the image_216.png, where it appears to have moved the camera position quite a bit. I looked at the Python, and it appears to have the correct camera positions, etc.

In the C++ adaptor, I have the  data set as a vtkImageData and I figure this is where the problem is, since the adaptor is expecting that and not RAW binary. Would I have to load the data into some intermediary vtkDoubleArrays, say, and then supply those to the vtkImageData? Or is there more to it than that?

This is more out of curiosity since the other approach works fine.

Mark

Hi Mark,

The adaptor is meant to convert a simulation code's data structures into
something that derives from vtkDataObject. So the adaptor could have a RAW
binary file passed in and produce a vtkImageData for your case. As far as
the Catalyst Python script is concerned, all it is expecting at for the
source is a vtkImageData in your example. It may be that the bounding box
of the data coming in from the RAW file is different than the vtkImageData
you load in the second time. I'd suggest checking that.

Something else you could try is the "fit to screen" option when outputting
screenshots from Catalyst. That should behave similarly to the fit to
screen option in the GUI.

Let me know if this isn't clear since I'm not sure I answered your question.

Andy

Subject: [Paraview] Change to ParaView plugins
Message-ID: <CAMaOp+EwmW0eu3x8oRcVVF-qU_8qGBcEFb5qGLZ2+BRaB6M-jg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

With today's gatekeeper review, the way reader and writer plugins are
handled in ParaView has changed. Now, they only need to be specified on the
server through the server manager XML. The Hints section of the XML
specifies what extensions to associate with the reader or the writer. The
advantage to this is that the client doesn't need to have it's own
definition of the reader or writer in order to associate an extension with
a reader or writer. This means that any client can connect to a server (of
the same ParaView version) and have all of the readers and writers that are
available on the server shown in the GUI. As an added bonus, it takes 2
less clicks to load a reader or writer plugin properly when connected to a
remote server!

I've updated the wiki documentation at
http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Plugin_HowTo#Adding_a_Reader.

Subject: [Paraview] minimum ffmpeg version
Message-ID: <CANjZAi-ng_FLRbYJBaAF3jXzXHsDbfE86Wm0orCHgjUrLumH4A@mail.gmail.com>

We would like to bump VTK's minimum ffmpeg version from 0.6.5 to something
more recent. This will simplify the vtkFFMPEGWriter class and related cmake
script that we used to support ancient and modern versions of FFMPEG.

Are there any objections? Any suggestions for what minimum version to
choose?

Message-ID: <CANaEcoyO945iYKbR-X6p8KtztLBuDyU-=rsOSX5rJ05BVu4v7g@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

please, advise me - what filter I should use to achieve such results in
ParaView:

images from Ansys CFX-post:
http://files.rsdn.ru/39468/1.png
http://files.rsdn.ru/39468/2.png

In CFX I do so: slice the 3D model by plane and then place a contour of
pressure on that slice.

When I do so in ParaView I get only contour line on slice not a map.
I try to find filter, that somehow project all contours of 3D model on
plane, but don't find anything useful

Thank you,
Alexander Petrov

I am now trying to migrate my custom reader panel to the new
architecture.  In the old panel, my custom panel code rearranged the
auto-generated layout of properties as attached screenshot to keep the
height of the panel short. Note lined-up controls at the top,
two-column layout of array selections at the middle, and checkboxes on
a collapsible panel at the bottom. This rearrangement was easy because
the custom code was a subclass of a panel (a
pqAutoGeneratedObjectPanel). I believe this type of saving screen
space is more important for the new properties panel which combines
proxy and display properties in a single panel.

In the new panel, if I am not wrong a customization has to be done per
widget basis. I thought I'd create a propertyWidget and let its
constructor
MyPropertyWidget::MyPropertyWidget(vtkSMProxy *smproxy, vtkSMProperty *smproperty, QWidget *parentObject=0)
do the rearrangement, i.e. I hoped I could obtain the parent panel
object by parentObject of the above signature. However, I always
get a null pointer.

Perhaps this is because in pqProxyWidget::createWidgetForProperty() in
pqPropertyWidget.cxx, the createdWidgetForProperty() call to
pqPropertyWidgetInterface is not given parentObj unlinke other
property widgets (pqDoubleVectorPropertyWidget etc). Why? - Or is
there an alternative?

Takuya,

I'm not sure if you've seen this wiki page:
http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Properties_Panel

A few things to note:

+ You can control the order in which the property widgets show up by
simply changing the order in which the properties are listed in  the
XML.

+ There is a mechanism for adding a single "widget" for a collection
of properties. This is called "Property Group".  You can put multiple
properties in a group and then specify a custom widget to create for
the entire group, using the panel_widget attribute. The widget can
decide how to create the internal widgets for each of the properties
in the group and how to lay them out. Thus you can create a property
group for the "Interval" row and put widgets horizontally. Some
examples to look at:

http://www.paraview.org/ParaView/Doc/Nightly/www/cxx-doc/classpqColorOpacityEditorWidget.html
http://www.paraview.org/ParaView/Doc/Nightly/www/cxx-doc/classpqFontPropertyWidget.html

+ Stay away from the temptation to put a property group for the entry
proxy, however. The "search" feature cannot work for widgets in a
property group (except for the property groups that are don't have any
custom widget, but are simply used for grouping i.e. those that don't
specify the panel_widget attribute).

+ For the checkboxes in the collapsible group, I'd suggest making them
as "advanced" and putting them in a property group without any
"panel_widget".

To answer your question specifically, it's just incidental that the
pqPropertyWidget is instantiated without a parent set, it gets set
afterwords. But it's dangerous for any pqPropertyWidget to try to muck
with the layout of others, since the panel's layout is dynamic. It
changes based on the search text the user put or the state of the
advanced button. The logic for the layouting is within the
pqProxyWidget, in case you're interested.

Subject: [Paraview] How to place a contour of variable on slice

To color the slice, highlight that in the pipeline browser and select the pressure variable from the middle toolbar (near the top left of the GUI). To get a contour-like effect with the colors, click the edit colors button (next to that chooser box you just used) turn on advanced options, and lower the resolution parameter.

If you want to see black lines on your colored slice, use the contour filter on the slice as you described, then change the lines' color to black. (Set variable to solid color, click on edit colors and pick black.) Then turn the visibility of the slice back on (eyeball button in the pipeline browser).

Hello,

please, advise me - what filter I should use to achieve such results in ParaView:

images from Ansys CFX-post:
http://files.rsdn.ru/39468/1.png
http://files.rsdn.ru/39468/2.png

In CFX I do so: slice the 3D model by plane and then place a contour of pressure on that slice.

When I do so in ParaView I get only contour line on slice not a map.
I try to find filter, that somehow project all contours of 3D model on plane, but don't find anything useful

Thank you,
Alexander Petrov

Subject: [Paraview] Unable to load Tecplot binary files
Message-ID: <FBCC95A16DC63C46948946CD51FA9AE19A399A@52ZHTX-D07-05E.area52.afnoapps.usaf.mil>

I am having trouble reading Tecplot binary data into ParaView 4.01.  My data is unstructured three-dimensional hexahedral data.  The data are split into a grid file (node centered xyz data and domain connectivity) and a solution file (cell centered) that contains all of the variables of interest.  The data is written using the Tecio library and the grid file is marked as a grid only file while the solution file is marked as a solution only file.
I am able to load the grid file alone into ParaView without issue.  If I attempt to load both the grid and the data file in ParaView crashes when I try to display one of the variables contained in the solution file.  Similarly, if I load the grid file, then load the solution file it will crash when I try to display one of the parameters.  I have observed this behavior in both the x64 Windows version and x64 Linux version.
I am including two files which are representative of the problem, grid.plt and solution.plt.  The domain is a simple box with 4^3 cells.  The solution file has 3 variables, Pressure, Temperature, and Velocity Magnitude.  Pressure is a uniform 101.325, Temperature ranges from 1 to 64, and Velocity Magnitude ranges from 1 to 64^2.

Thanks,
Matt

Thanks for the file Sam, but having  looked into it some more I think that
I need to be using a polydata format rather than unstructured grid, as the
data I have is a point mesh.

Could anyone let me know how the legacy files need to be set up for
polydata using vertices?

My code outputs a grid of points with an x,y,z coordinate, and on each
point a value of a 3D velocity field (vx, vy, vz) is defined.

I want to use the stream tracer on this data, but don't know what the ASCII
files need to look like in order to be read correctly by Paraview.

Thanks
George

I am not sure that the Tecplot reader can handle separate grid and 
solution files. I encountered the same problem with the CGNS reader. As 
you have only three variables, why don't you gather your grid and your 
solution in a single Tecplot file ?

Dear Utkarsh,


Many thanks for Your reply, Your effort to create an XML-plugin and the bug 
report. Would it help to compile paraview from source with 
Module_vtkImagingStencil set to ON on our own platform for testing or is there 
some code adjustment of paraview necessary to allow that? I guess it would not 
help to specify the location of a separately compiled vtk-5.10?
I had a look at the attached xml-file, however am left with two questions:

Do I understand correctly that with using port_index= You specify which output 
should go to which input?
What is calling e.g. the vtkImplicitPlaneWidget to get the interaction widget 
for specifying the implicit function parameters?

Many thanks again for Your help
Roman

Subject: [Paraview] Compositing times in timer log
Message-ID: <5212209C.2010204@surfsara.nl>

Hi,

We're doing some scaling tests with different numbers of nodes with a 
parallel PV server. We have some idea of the bandwidth the compositing 
steps take, by looking at network interface statistics and such. But I 
seem to remember seeing compositing timings in the timer log output a 
long time ago, but fail to see any in our tests now. Is that part of the 
remote render process still timed?

Regards,

Hello Utkarsh, 

I finally used your approach ("? You can add a custom widget for some property that still listens to the dataUpdated() event from the pqPipelineSource corresponding to the reader's proxy ?"), here are 2 videos of the result.

Sorry that mouse was not captured by vlc (my screen capture soft on linux).

In this video I move the sliders, and upon apply(), the reader update the final correct values to the widget.
http://youtu.be/GFz--7kJt3Q

In this video I use a downstream filter (the optimization1) to search for the best value of the second slider (the minimum of the val field) for a fixed position of the first slider.
The slider is updated using the value asked by the optimizer. 
http://youtu.be/s4NNMCkDGH0


Maybe this is not the best approach, but the result looks good.

Enjoy the videos,

Felipe

Georg,
This is a paraview bug.  I have found it, and have a fix.  I am just waiting for my cluster to come back online, so I can test.  I will post a bug, and get Kitware to install the fix.

I use the ensight gold transient single-file format. When I remove all time stepping information (i.e. BEGIN TIME STEP and END TIME STEP and everything related to it in the case file) and only visualize one single time step everything works fine. I simply cannot figure out what is going wrong. I appreciate any help in solving this issue.

Subject: [Paraview] Fastest way of getting Max/Min from multiple files.
Message-ID: <52126F71.8060108@masonlive.gmu.edu>

I have code that reads in multiple .vtk (legacy VTK) binary files. 
Currently I am looping through viewtimes and grabbing the range and 
saving the value if it's higher than the previous value (and lower..). 
I've looked quite a bit through tutorials and other threads and haven't 
found anything to this sort, but In order to save processing time, is 
there a simple way to grab a range for all time steps and not each file 
one by one?

Thanks,
~Brian

The temporal statistics filter has an option for computing min and max on a
point by point and cell by cell basis. You can look at the range of that
result to find the global min and max over space and time.

You mentioned saving processing time. if you're doing this more than 
once on a given timeseries you could use a custom field data array to 
store the min and max for each array that you care about. If these field 
data arrays aren't present, then you'd compute them and rewrite the 
first datafile in the series adding the new 2 value arrays. If the 
arrays are present then use the pre-computed values. Assuming that you 
don't have another reason for always reading/processing the entire time 
series this could save you quite a bit of I/O overhead.

Hello

I am trying to visualize a gaussian cube file using paraview. I can see the
isosurfaces but the atoms and bonds do not appear.

I tried atom_type in GeometryRepresentation but nothing happened

Could you help me?

Best regard

I can read it into Paraview but when I try to plot vectors using the Glyph

Subject: [Paraview] Segmentation fault from ProgrammableFilter/Source
Message-ID: <5213823A.2060401@ufz.de>

Hi,

I'm trying to do some batched postprocessing on a unix cluster using 
pvbatch/pvpython from Paraview3.14 with OSMesa. Unfortunately, I end up 
with an error (see bottom of mail). I could narrow it down to this 
minimal example:

from paraview.simple import *
programmableSource1 = ProgrammableSource()
programmableSource1.Script = 'print "foo"'
UpdatePipeline()

This works on the same machine with the ParaView-4.0.1-Linux-64bit 
superbuild but not with the mentioned PV3.14 that was build on our 
server. Unfortunately, I need this ParaView version for 
off-screen-Rendering.

Any Ideas, why the programmable source and filter are not working while 
other filters do?

Thanks,

Gerrit

Hi Matt,

The Tecplot binary files are loaded into ParaView through the VisIt bridge.
I'm checking on the VisIt list to see if they can do that and if they can,
then we can incorporate that properly into ParaView. I'll keep you posted
on any progress.

Thanks for the info.
Andy

I have used the "elements.case" file from "paraview data" for testing.

I have compiled in my ubuntu Paraview 3.14, 3.98 and 4.0.1 from source.
Also, I have downloaded the Paraview binaries for 3.14, 3.98 and 4.0.1

With the paraview binaries the "elements.case" is viewed correctly.

With my paraview builds the "elements.case"  is not viewed correctly, all
the geometry appears overlaid. I attached an screenshot.

Why is this happening?

Thanks in advance

Paraview reads it wrong, the values of the velocity in the information
window range from -1e+299 to 1e299. Where is the mistake that causes
Paraview to read the wrong values?

Thank you,

Hi Andy, yes that was clear. I'd been conveniently ignoring the bounding dimensions.

Hi Mark,
The adaptor is meant to convert a simulation code's data structures into something that derives from vtkDataObject. So the adaptor could have a RAW binary file passed in and produce a vtkImageData for your case. As far as the Catalyst Python script is concerned, all it is expecting at for the source is a vtkImageData in your example. It may be that the bounding box of the data coming in from the RAW file is different than the vtkImageData you load in the second time. I'd suggest checking that.
Something else you could try is the "fit to screen" option when outputting screenshots from Catalyst. That should behave similarly to the fit to screen option in the GUI.
Let me know if this isn't clear since I'm not sure I answered your question.

Andy

Hello, is there a way to set up a coprocessing adaptor to work with RAW binary files? What I've done in the past is to first load a RAW binary in the GUI and export a coprocessing script to save a vti, run the simulation a single timestep writing the vti, then load that and save another script to create images from the full simulation.

I tried skipping the write to vti step and instead have the render-to-image script based on the RAW binary source. Attached is what I get, the image_216.png, where it appears to have moved the camera position quite a bit. I looked at the Python, and it appears to have the correct camera positions, etc.

In the C++ adaptor, I have the  data set as a vtkImageData and I figure this is where the problem is, since the adaptor is expecting that and not RAW binary. Would I have to load the data into some intermediary vtkDoubleArrays, say, and then supply those to the vtkImageData? Or is there more to it than that?

This is more out of curiosity since the other approach works fine.

Mark

Message-ID: <7F781841FF1E044388AFA42B70703A7A766A8088@CHIMBX6.ad.uillinois.edu>

Hello, for a CUDA application with coprocessing, is it correct that between a simulation step and coprocessing that the data will make a roundtrip from the device to the host and back to the device, since parts of the vis pipeline run on the CPU?

Can Piston work with coprocessing, would that avoid this round-trip?

How about for Xeon Phis?

Thanks,
Mark

Georg,
This is a paraview bug.  I have found it, and have a fix.  I am just waiting for my cluster to come back online, so I can test.  I will post a bug, and get Kitware to install the fix.

I use the ensight gold transient single-file format. When I remove all time stepping information (i.e. BEGIN TIME STEP and END TIME STEP and everything related to it in the case file) and only visualize one single time step everything works fine. I simply cannot figure out what is going wrong. I appreciate any help in solving this issue.

I am not sure if anyone has tried putting Piston and Coprocessing together
yet. If so I would like to hear about it. If not and someone is trying, I
wouldn't mind getting involved in that effort.

But yes Mark you are right. As it stands there will be a round trip in
between the simulation and vis stages. We will have to extend Catalyst with
the ability to create a vtkPistonDataObject that refers to the data already
on the GPU in order to avoid it.

Hi Mark,

There are other people interested in this as well since as you point out it
can be a bit of a waste to move data from the GPU to the CPU and then back
to the GPU. I don't know anyone that is working on this problem yet either
but it will be a necessary improvement that eventually should be done.
Hopefully it's just an SBIR or STTR away :)

Andy

Since piston is a very thin wrapper around a dataobject and is easy to customize for your own specific requirements, passing a device ptr handle from your simulation code into a piston data object to be further processed on the GPU will be trivial. Where you may have trouble is doing the render on the GPU in the absence of a Xserver (if you're using cray XE/XK nodes for example).

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [Paraview] Help with reading vectors from XDMF

I want to read a XDMF file with an orthogonal structured grid and a vector attribute. I have the following example file:

<?xml version="1.0" ?>

       </DataItem>
      </Attribute>
   </Grid>
  </Domain>
</Xdmf>

However Paraview reads it wrong, the values of the velocity in the information window range from -1e+299 to 1e299. Where is the mistake that causes Paraview to read the wrong values?

Thank you,

Nikos

Message-ID: <CA+ze5C7NpmCGho0egqumudBwR6abg_MRWFScx7iN0pGG_sUnDw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I need to apply  Contour or IsoVolume or Threshold on my DataSet to get a
plume and then see the evolution of this plume by time but because my
DataSet is huge (100M cells)  after a few time steps as my plume gets
vaster, ParaView crashes.

Is there any way to apply one of these filters on a
geometrically-proportional sample of my DataSet so that ParaView doesn?t
crash?

Thanks

Hi,

Sorry for late reply to this. Unfortunately the smallest DataSet I have is
300M and I can?t email it. but this is what is happening and I would
appreciate any help regarding this memory usage.

I am opening h5 files using PFlotran HDF5 reader in ParaView to open my
files which are result of PFlotran simulation.

I?d appreciate any help.

Thanks

Subject: [Paraview] Writing Images at certian time Steps using pvpython
Message-ID: <CA+ze5C5GB6-HQn45YPLiqUGZR3fEZixETVvAMUCrZimVK4MFJQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

My Data is of type h5 that I open using PFlotran HDF5 reader in ParaView
which are result of PFlotran simulation.

What I am trying to do is to write an image at a certain time step and then
finally write a batch job that writes an image for each time step of the
simulation result.

If I try to interactively go to a certain time step and then save an image,
everything works fine.

The problem is I have 40 time steps and I want to do the same procedure
often. So I saved my state file as a python script and then set these few
lines at the end of script just before Render().

RenderView1.ViewTime = 0.0
RenderView1.CacheKey = 0.0
RenderView1.UseCache = 0
AnimationScene1 = GetAnimationScene()
AnimationScene1.AnimationTime = 0.0
WriteImage('myImage.jpg')

Render()


My timeSeries start at 0 and the python script works just fine for 0.

If I change the following lines to 10000 (my final time step) or any other
time step, then pvpython crashes, that is the following change to the
script makes the pvpython crash:

RenderView1.ViewTime = 10000.0
RenderView1.CacheKey = 10000.0
RenderView1.UseCache = 0
AnimationScene1 = GetAnimationScene()
AnimationScene1.AnimationTime = 10000.0
WriteImage('myImage.jpg')

Render()

I used the trace to see what values I need to change to save an screen shot
for any time step and I ended up with ViewTime and AnimationTime.

I have attached my script with this email. I would be grateful if you could
please tell me if I need to change more in my script or add any additional
lines to be able to get an screenshot of any timestep rather than 0.

Thanks in Advance.

Hedieh,

My first suggestion is to use the Contour filter rather than either IsoVolume or Threshold. The result should take much less memory.

You did not mention what kind of data you have, and that makes a difference if you want to subsample your data. If you have a regular data set (image/uniform grid, rectilinear, or structured/curvilinear), then you can you use the Extract Subset filter to subsample the data. Turn on the advanced options and change the Sample Rate I,J,K to set the subsampling. If you have something like an unstructured grid, you can use the Resample With Dataset filter.

Hello,

I need to apply  Contour or IsoVolume or Threshold on my DataSet to get a plume and then see the evolution of this plume by time but because my DataSet is huge (100M cells)  after a few time steps as my plume gets vaster, ParaView crashes.

Is there any way to apply one of these filters on a geometrically-proportional sample of my DataSet so that ParaView doesn?t crash?

time is not always the same as time-step. Here's an example of how you 
could query the reader for time values and then use them

... nSteps = 0
steps = reader.TimestepValues
try:
nSteps = len(steps)
except:
nSteps = 1
steps = [steps] ...

anim = GetAnimationScene()
anim.PlayMode = 'Snap To TimeSteps'
anim.AnimationTime = steps[step]
view = GetRenderView()
view.ViewTime = steps[step] ... Render()

Hi Kit,

There is currently no example demonstrating the uncertainty surface
plugin (although there is a test case that just uses made up data on a
wavelet).

The general gist of it is to load your data set, enable the
uncertainty surface representation, and then select your scalar
uncertainty array in the display section of the properties panel.

If you have specific problems/issues I could help with those. Let me know.

Thanks,
Kyle

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview Benchmark and IceT timings
Message-ID: <5215CE8F.6080307@surfsara.nl>

Hey all,

I am trying to do a benchmark, in order to be able to compare our GPU cluster and our Supercomputer. The GPU cluster has one Nvidia GTX680 per node 
and 10G ethernet, while the supercomputer has no GPU's and Infiniband

In short, i open a file with 31 million triangles, run D3() to divide it over the processes, and render it to a 1600x1200 renderview, using a python 
script (attached) and pvpython (paraview 3.98.1).

However, i am running into some unexpected deviations in my frame render times on the GPU-cluster, when using multiple (8+) nodes. Most frames render 
in a constant time, but every so many frames i get one 2 to 3 times as slow.  The output of the benchmark module doesnt shine much light on the 
subject: All processes report the same, much higher frame time for these frames, so it is not clear if one process is slowing the whole down.

Our initial hunch was that it might have to do with the compositing step: Since the infiniband is much faster in terms of latency and throughput, this 
step might be more efficient on the Supercomputer.

My question is, is there a way to separate the benchmark times of the rendering and the compositing part of each frame?
Or is there any other advice on pinpointing the performance culprit?

regards,
Tijs de Kler

Hi Burlen,

Thanks for your reply. Actually when I mentioned final time step at  10000
to get the image; by 10000 I actually was referring to the the time. ( The
time step related to this time (10000) is time step 40)

I see what time is relating to what time step by using the
"AnnotateTimeFilter" and seeing the times interactively.

Considering that I know the correct time, still pvpython crashes when I try
to get the image at a different time by changing the following to
time=10000 or any other time that exist in my simulation result.

RenderView1.ViewTime = 10000.0
RenderView1.CacheKey = 10000.0
RenderView1.UseCache = 0
AnimationScene1 = GetAnimationScene()
AnimationScene1.AnimationTime = 10000.0
WriteImage('myImage.jpg')

Render()

Any ideas on what I could be doing wrong and how to get the image at a
different time using pvpython ?

I?d appreciate any help
Thanks

Thanks Kyle,

I guess what I was wondering is what sort of inputs it is designed for and
meant to visualise. For example

Is it something like:

Data_field_1 = My values
Data_field_2 = My uncertainties

where

MyResultsWithErrors = Data field 1 +/- Data field 2

In which case can it handle a case where the errors are asymetric?

Or is is more

Data_field_2 = 1 - the chance of Data_field_1 happening

Also can it handle point sets or just connected surface data?

Kit

Also, the technique used is described in the paper entitled
"Visualization of uncertain scalar data fields using color scales and
perceptually adapted noise" by Coninx et. al.

The values (e.g. "Data_field_1") should be set as the regular "Color
by" array. The uncertainties (e.g. "Data_field_2") should be set as
the uncertainty array for the representation. The uncertainties are
expected to be positive and on the same scale as the input data. The
higher the uncertainty value, the more "noisy" the surface will be
rendered.

For now, the representation only works with surface rendering.

Hope this helps,

Hi Fernando,

What version of ParaView are you using? With the current version and
the following steps I was able to visualize the atoms and isosurface
(screenshot attached).

1. Open cube file (in my case benzene-homo.cube)
2. Click "Apply"
3. Click on "Output" in the Pipeline Browser
4. Apply "Glyph" filter with "Glyph Type" = Sphere
5. Click on "Gridded Data" in the Pipeline Browser
6. Apply "Contour" filter
7. Change color mode to "Solid Color", select red color, set "Opacity" to "0.4"

Let me know if you run into any issues.

Thanks,
Kyle

Message-ID: <CAM3A=6jNQbFA6iWtWFLNAee_fKKz7zhUhhCOWKPxutDS-1-nLw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Utkarsh,

Please find the sample results file in the zip folder for the first 3 time
steps. You can load the state to find the expression for stressxx
 (calculator1) and strainxx (calculator2).

I would like to integrate the stress and strain separately over the whole
domain at each time step and save it in an arrays to plot the average
stress and avg. strain over time.
Later I would like to plot the stress-strain relationship.

Please let me know how  to do it in Paraview.

HI Alan,

On following the procedure mentioned in your mail, the paraview gives error
message that
Cannot volume render since no point (or cell) data available.

Please find attached zip file with the sample data at the first timestep.
The pvsm state file renders the clip/section view and provides the
information inside the domain in the surface rendering. How to volume
render the data ?

Warm regards,
Rakesh

if you haven't yet it worth while to print the time values reported by 
the reader. make sure it's not changing them on you. after that try to 
get a stack trace showing where the crash occurs.

There are some internal measurements taken, but I'm not sure there is any
way to get to them without hacking on some code.


You might be able to get a rough estimate of where the time is taken by
playing with the input a bit. If you put a small number of large polygons
on each process and force compositing on, that can give you an idea of the
time to do (mostly) just compositing. Conversely you could load in a
smaller number of polygons and turn compositing off.

Not sure if that helps...

Message-ID: <CA+ze5C7C5e4dBJwJ8DwD17aFdgdfB2PJQM-97704K1375G99LQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,


Is there anyway to have a background for your legend. I usually have a
zoomIn of the screen and usually the legend mixes with the image (which is
what I want) and the numbers don?t distinguish very clearly. I know I can
change the color of the numbers in legend or just save legend separately
and put it on top of the screenshot I get from ParaView in another editor ,
but I was wondering if there is an easy way to save time and have a
background for your legend in ParaView, so that it wouldn?t mix with the
with the background even though you put it on top of a background with the
same color.

Is there anyway to do that?

Thanks in Advance

Rakesh,

I;ve reported a bug (http://paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=14242). The
issue is that currently, volume rendering for unstructured grids is
only supported using single-component arrays. You can apply the
calculator to extract a a component or compute the magnitude as a work
around.

Subject: [Paraview] Stream Tracer in eigenvector field
Message-ID: <072E56E27FBC094398260E491A664E8F53FF3692@DM2PRD0112MB671.prod.exchangelabs.com>

The term "eigenvector", used to describe the principal directions of a tensor, is a bit of a misnomer since it's not a "vector" as interpreted by the Stream Tracer filter - it's more accurately bi-directional like tension/compression and could be termed "eigenaxis/eigenaxes". When interpreted as a vector, there is an inherent sign ambiguity in each eigenvector - the sign is indeterminate and one is free to choose + or -, and that is exactly what Mathematica does ( likely true for other routines also ).

I've been using Mathematica to prototype computations for the investigation of tensor topology which I then visualize in ParaView. Eigen-decomposition of a tensor field at each grid point returns an orthonormal set of eigenvectors, uncorrelated with any neighbors. Taken separately, each eigenvector field exhibits large regions of smoothly varying orientation, but there are systematic and random reversals of orientation that confound the Stream Tracer filter, sending streamlines wandering around the field. What is needed is a true tangent curve ( tensor line ) integrator that would avoid "doubling back" as the "streamline" propagates, similar to the scheme of Weinstein, et. al., ( IEEE VIS'99 ) which computes the dot product of the incoming propagation vector with the eigenvector; and if near -1, negate the outgoing propagation vector. This can also be fancied-up to accommodate noisy initial tensor data as in Weinstein.

I think I would be taking on too much at this point in learning to write my own filter so have been exploring ways to pre-process the eigenvector fields before visualizing in Paraview, but I ask:
1. Have I missed something in existing filters that would handle this?
2. Can the existing Stream Tracer be modified?
3. Does the eigenvector routine in ParaView yield the same sign ambiguity among uncorrelated computations?

Thanks,

Hi Paul,

Apologies as my math is a bit rusty but isn't the sign of the eigenvector
related to the sign of its corresponding eigenvalue? In that case if you
make sure that all of the eigenvalues are positive then all of their
corresponding eigenvectors should be aligned properly. If that's the case
and you have access to the eigenvalues of the eigenvectors you could use
the calculator or python calculator to properly orient the eigenvectors.

In any case, if you can come up with an algorithm that properly orients the
eigenvectors you should be able to do that in the python calculator or
calculator filters. If not, then things could get a bit hairy as far as
computationally figuring out which is the "proper" direction your
eigenvalues should have.

Regards,
Andy

Eigenvectors are unique up to a constantso if you took any eigenvector 
and multiplied it by -1 it's still an eigenvector. You could see it in 
the definition,

M x=\lambda x

eigenvector x appears in both sides of the eqn.

I had a similar problem with tensor glyphs in ParaView. In that case I 
was able to solve by looking at the sign of the determinant of the 
transformation matrix (see bug report, patch and mail list posts below). 
I wonder if you could adapt/build on this solution there to solve your 
issue here?

Burlen, you had me hoping, but alas ... there is no direct correlation between the determinant ( a.k.a. the 3rd tensor invariant ) and the orientation of the computed eigenvectors. You did get me thinking there may be other possibilities. I'm sure I can use the dot product in a marching cube scheme to enforce a consistent orientation progression and generate a "vector" field ParaView will handle well. It'll just have to be robust enough to handle a true change near some sharp topological feature.

Thanks,
Paul

in the case of the glyphing algorithm it's the surface normals of the 
transformed glyph that have the relation to the sign determinant of the 
transform matrix. this transformation matrix is constructed from the 
eigenvectors directly. at any rate, good luck.

Paul,

Sorry to have given such an off target answer! Your idea about checking 
the dot product as you progress makes sense. That's how VTK's a hyper 
stream tracer handles the issue. I wonder if you can make use of it? 
Bringing VTK classes into PV isn't too hard but parallelizing them can 
be challenging.

No, it won't help. I did exactly that an ran into issues with
vtkImageStencil and ParaView. Evidently, we hadn't tried to use that
data-object in ParaView before.

You are correct, it will not help. We need to track the issue down on
the ParaView side first.

That is correct. If not specified, 0 is assumed.

In this case, it's the "ProxyListDomain" associated with the
"ImplicitFunction" property. The domain refers to proxies viz.
("implicit_functions", "Plane"), etc. If you look at the xml
definitions for the same in ParaView
(ParaViewCore/ServerManager/SMApplication/Resources/utilities.xml),
you'll see that it provides a "<Hints>" section that suggests a
"PropertyGroup" of type "Plane". That's what's causing the GUI to show
the vtkImplicitPlaneWidget to control the Origin and Normal
properties.

Hope that clarifies things a bit.

Based on the feedback (on the users and developers mailing lists), I
am going to put removal of the support for legacy panels in the queue
for the next release (or two). Thanks to those who responded. Also, if
anyone has questions about how to convert their old panels to the new
style, please feel free to use the mailing list.

Subject: [Paraview] Tube Filter for ExodusII-BEAM
Message-ID: <alpine.DEB.2.02.1308261644001.15206@thnkpd>

Hi,

I am using exodusii and Paraview.

In my exo-file, I store blocks of type BEAM. Each BEAM-block has its own 
"attributes" - such as area, orientation etc. .

In Paraview: I see those beams as "lines". But I would like to see them in 3D, 
i.e. as tubes or so.

How can I use the "attributes" of the beams to generate 3D tubes or so in 
Paraview?

What options do I have?

Cheers,
Sven

There is a filter called "Tube" that you can use to turn lines into tubes.
The tube filter also has the ability to vary the radius of the tubes based
on a scalar. The Tube filter expects poly data not unstructured data, so
you will have to pass your data through the Extract Surface filter first.

Hmm, I'm not sure you have access to the element attribute or block
properties within ParaView. ParaView is really optimized for reading
results data.

Dave, do you know if there is a way to get at this information from an
Exodus file?

Caveats: NONE

I'm having an issue with the extract CTH parts filter in ParaView 4.0.1.
The dataset consists of 1024 spcth files, regular structured mesh, 14
blocks.  The issue seems to be that once I exceed X number of server
processes (it seems to be about 80 servers), I start seeing holes in the
resulting geometry.  The more I exceed the magic number of servers, the more
holes I see in the resulting part.    If I create a clip using the
volume_fraction scalar variable(s),  the geometry of the clip is correct -
that is, the underlying data seems to be there.   So, I'm thinking that the
data is being properly distributed and all of the data is accounted for, but
that there's an issue with the "extract CTH parts" filter?    Doesn't seem
likely, but stranger things have happened.

Any ideas?

Bad node?

Try running the problem on a few nodes.  Next, try running the "big node" problem.  As you shift the nodes you are using, does the issue follow the underlying iron, or the same bad blocks in the dataset?

Dataset opens correctly with smaller number of nodes?

Want me to try it here?  80 does seem really, really small/easy/trivial for big data...

Alan - yeah, the dataset opens correctly with < 80 servers.   It doesn't
matter how I distribute those 80 servers - I can do 16 processes on 5 nodes,

Bad node?

Try running the problem on a few nodes.  Next, try running the "big node"
problem.  As you shift the nodes you are using, does the issue follow the
underlying iron, or the same bad blocks in the dataset?

Dataset opens correctly with smaller number of nodes?

Want me to try it here?  80 does seem really, really small/easy/trivial for
big data...

I'm having an issue with the extract CTH parts filter in ParaView 4.0.1.
The dataset consists of 1024 spcth files, regular structured mesh, 14
blocks.  The issue seems to be that once I exceed X number of server
processes (it seems to be about 80 servers), I start seeing holes in the
resulting geometry.  The more I exceed the magic number of servers, the more
holes I see in the resulting part.    If I create a clip using the
volume_fraction scalar variable(s),  the geometry of the clip is correct -
that is, the underlying data seems to be there.   So, I'm thinking that the
data is being properly distributed and all of the data is accounted for, but
that there's an issue with the "extract CTH parts" filter?    Doesn't seem
likely, but stranger things have happened.

Any ideas?

Here is a small patch that will get the VTK reader loading data. A vtkpython script is also attached that demonstrates it on the exEdgeFaceElem.exii test file in vtkData.

However, I leave it as an exercise to the reader to expose things in ParaView... it was hard coming up with all the little icons for different types of data arrays and now you need 3 more (edge, face, and element block attributes)! Plus you may need to add some convenience methods to the vtkExodusIIReader class to expose the different types of attributes in a way that lets ParaView map them to properties.

Hello,

I have a cube of size grid with N^3 grid points. I want to colour some
glyphs as a function of their coordinate.. i.e. if they are on the left of
a plane (plane normal and origin provided), they should be coloured red,
otherwise blue. Any tips how can I do this?

Burlen,

Not really off target - it needed to be checked. And thanks for the heads-up on the hyperstreamline plugin - the FixVector routine is exactly it: they interpolate the field tensor, compute it's eigenvectors, and "fix" the stream propagation if the eigenvector's orientation is flipped.

I've played with applying a tube filter to a streamline in a vector field - color from one eigenvalue and cross-section from the other two - to get a hyperstreamline, but a combination of the StreamTracer and HyperStreamline filters would be ideal: direct application to tensor fields and orientation correction as in HyperStreamline with seeding and streamlines from StreamTracer.

With regard to your glyph orientation issue: Forgive me if you already know this, but if you look at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant you will see that, geometrically, the determinant of a 2x2 matrix is just an oriented parallelogram. The determinant of a 3x3 matrix is equal to the volume of a parallelepiped. They don't say, but I believe the faces are the geometric equivalent of the minors of the 3x3, to which the interpretation of the 2x2 determinant applies. Again they don't mention, but volumes have orientations determined by the orientation of their faces ... so your negative determinants give an orientation reflected by the inward-pointing normals ... apparently reflected in the glyph construction ... eh?

Paul,

Sorry to have given such an off target answer! Your idea about checking the dot product as you progress makes sense. That's how VTK's a hyper stream tracer handles the issue. I wonder if you can make use of it? Bringing VTK classes into PV isn't too hard but parallelizing them can be challenging.

Burlen, you had me hoping, but alas ... there is no direct correlation between the determinant ( a.k.a. the 3rd tensor invariant ) and the orientation of the computed eigenvectors. You did get me thinking there may be other possibilities. I'm sure I can use the dot product in a marching cube scheme to enforce a consistent orientation progression and generate a "vector" field ParaView will handle well. It'll just have to be robust enough to handle a true change near some sharp topological feature.

Thanks,

Eigenvectors are unique up to a constant so if you took any eigenvector and multiplied it by -1 it's still an eigenvector. You could see it in the definition,

M x=\lambda x

eigenvector x appears in both sides of the eqn.

I had a similar problem with tensor glyphs in ParaView. In that case I was able to solve by looking at the sign of the determinant of the transformation matrix (see bug report, patch and mail list posts below). I wonder if you could adapt/build on this solution there to solve your issue here?

Hi Paul,

Apologies as my math is a bit rusty but isn't the sign of the eigenvector related to the sign of its corresponding eigenvalue? In that case if you make sure that all of the eigenvalues are positive then all of their corresponding eigenvectors should be aligned properly. If that's the case and you have access to the eigenvalues of the eigenvectors you could use the calculator or python calculator to properly orient the eigenvectors.

In any case, if you can come up with an algorithm that properly orients the eigenvectors you should be able to do that in the python calculator or calculator filters. If not, then things could get a bit hairy as far as computationally figuring out which is the "proper" direction your eigenvalues should have.

The term "eigenvector", used to describe the principal directions of a tensor, is a bit of a misnomer since it's not a "vector" as interpreted by the Stream Tracer filter - it's more accurately bi-directional like tension/compression and could be termed "eigenaxis/eigenaxes". When interpreted as a vector, there is an inherent sign ambiguity in each eigenvector - the sign is indeterminate and one is free to choose + or -, and that is exactly what Mathematica does ( likely true for other routines also ).

I've been using Mathematica to prototype computations for the investigation of tensor topology which I then visualize in ParaView. Eigen-decomposition of a tensor field at each grid point returns an orthonormal set of eigenvectors, uncorrelated with any neighbors. Taken separately, each eigenvector field exhibits large regions of smoothly varying orientation, but there are systematic and random reversals of orientation that confound the Stream Tracer filter, sending streamlines wandering around the field. What is needed is a true tangent curve ( tensor line ) integrator that would avoid "doubling back" as the "streamline" propagates, similar to the scheme of Weinstein, et. al., ( IEEE VIS'99 ) which computes the dot product of the incoming propagation vector with the eigenvector; and if near -1, negate the outgoing propagation vector. This can also be fancied-up to accommodate noisy initial tensor data as in Weinstein.

I think I would be taking on too much at this point in learning to write my own filter so have been exploring ways to pre-process the eigenvector fields before visualizing in Paraview, but I ask:
1. Have I missed something in existing filters that would handle this?
2. Can the existing Stream Tracer be modified?
3. Does the eigenvector routine in ParaView yield the same sign ambiguity among uncorrelated computations?

Thanks,
Paul W

No, I'm not able to share either ... I'm going to try to find a similarly
sized dataset that might be more readily available.   Although, there's not
really an easy way to share a dataset with 1024 spcth files .....

We are having an additional issue with this same dataset .... loading the
dataset using less than 80 servers (so there are no holes in the geometry)
we are creating a simple animation.   There are several hundred timesteps of
data and we are able to interactively march through time and see the
animation.  However, when trying to save out a movie,   the frames suddenly
go blank.  We tried saving out as PNG files, and the first 22 timesteps
dumped fine, and then we started saving out solid black images.   We
restarted ParaView and started dumping out JPEG frames, and we got out to
timestep 100 and it again started dumping black frames.     Interactively
viewing the data, all of the timesteps are valid -  is there a memory leak
or something similar that's causing the renderer to hose up?

I'll try to do some profiling to see if I can reproduce this. In the
mean time, can you try turning off display lists, i.e. turn on "Use
Immediate Mode Rendering" from the Settings Dialog's "Render View"
page? If that doesn't help, also try turning off "Use Offscreen
Rendering for Screenshots" from the same dialog.

Coincidentally, I am looking at the CTH parts class of filters right now. Can you share the data or the images with the holes?

Bad node?

Try running the problem on a few nodes.  Next, try running the "big node"
problem.  As you shift the nodes you are using, does the issue follow the
underlying iron, or the same bad blocks in the dataset?

Dataset opens correctly with smaller number of nodes?

Want me to try it here?  80 does seem really, really small/easy/trivial for
big data...

I'm having an issue with the extract CTH parts filter in ParaView 4.0.1.
The dataset consists of 1024 spcth files, regular structured mesh, 14
blocks.  The issue seems to be that once I exceed X number of server
processes (it seems to be about 80 servers), I start seeing holes in the
resulting geometry.  The more I exceed the magic number of servers, the more
holes I see in the resulting part.    If I create a clip using the
volume_fraction scalar variable(s),  the geometry of the clip is correct -
that is, the underlying data seems to be there.   So, I'm thinking that the
data is being properly distributed and all of the data is accounted for, but
that there's an issue with the "extract CTH parts" filter?    Doesn't seem
likely, but stranger things have happened.

Any ideas?

I'll try to do some profiling to see if I can reproduce this. In the mean time, can you try turning off display lists, i.e. turn on "Use Immediate Mode Rendering" from the Settings Dialog's "Render View"
page? If that doesn't help, also try turning off "Use Offscreen Rendering for Screenshots" from the same dialog.

I don't see a BUILD_SHARED that I can toggle. All of the CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS* vars are empty, if those are related.

Any suggestions?

Thanks,
Mark

Subject: [Paraview] cannot find -lvtkPVPythonCatalyst error when doing
	coprocessing
Message-ID: <65F8B323A072504ABFC5D3D8751910514FEB1119@MAIL-MBX2.ad.renci.org>

When building our simulation code linked to ParaView 3.98 (built with coprocessing enabled) with CMake, I got the error "cannot find -lvtkPVPythonCatalyst" in the final linking stage. I followed Catalyst User Guide to add the following into CMakeLists.txt to handle coprocessing:

------------------------------------------
...
find_package(ParaView 3.98 REQUIRED COMPONENTS vtkPVPythonCatalyst PhastaAdaptor)
include("${PARAVIEW_USE_FILE}")
add_definitions("-DUSE_CATALYST")
...
target_link_libraries(phastaIC.exe vtkPVPythonCatalyst PhastaAdaptor)
...
------------------------------------------

I verified there is no vtkPVPythonCatalyst lib in the ParaView build, although there are a few coprocessing-related libs there in the ParaView build. Should I change vtkPVPythonCatalyst to some coprocessing-related component? If so, which component name should I use? I need to use python for pipeline handling and link catalyst to fortran code.

Thanks for any tips you can provide!

Hi Hong,

The Catalyst User's Guide corresponds to ParaView 4.0 and later. You're
correct that for 3.98 you'll need to link to one of the CoProcessing
libraries. If I recall correctly, you should use:

TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES(phastaIC.exe vtkCoProcessorImplementation)

 If that doesn't work, can you email me the list of CoProcessing libraries
in your build tree?
Regards,
Andy

Hi Andy,

That seems to work well, but just to double make sure, let me copy the list of relevant coprocessing libs for 3.98 for your perusal:
----------------
libvtkCoProcessorCS-pv3.98.a
libvtkCoProcessorPython27D-pv3.98.a
libvtkCoProcessorImplementation-pv3.98.a
libvtkCoProcessorPython-pv3.98.a
libvtkCoProcessor-pv3.98.a
----------------

On a related question, now I am getting error "cannot find -lPhastaAdaptor" although I have libPhastaAdaptor.a in the lib directory. It looks like it tries to link to shared library rather than the static library. I am using "find_package(ParaView 3.98 REQUIRED COMPONENTS vtkCoProcessorImplementation PhastaAdaptor)" followed by "target_link_libraries(phastaIC.exe vtkCoProcessorImplementation PhastaAdaptor)" in CMakeLists.txt file. What else should I do or correct to make the linker to link to libPhastaAdaptor.a (as it did for other coprocessing-related static libs) rather than link to shared lib via -lPhastaAdaptor?

Thanks and best regards,
Hong

Mark can you send me your CMakeCache from the tools directory?

The tools build should be an entirely shared build and the cross build
should be an entirely static build. I am unsure why it might be mixing
static and shared in this case and the CMakeCache may tell me.

Rick/Alan,

Can you guys try the attached patch to see if the holes issue is
fixed? I am going to further cleanup the filter, but I want to make
sure the holes were indeed caused by this particular bug before I
change more code.

Thanks
Utkarsh

David, here it is. Is superbuild the recommended method for cross compiling? I also looked at ParaViewAutoBuild.
Thanks,

make[2]: *** [paraview/src/paraview-stamp/paraview-build] Error 1

I don't see a BUILD_SHARED that I can toggle. All of the CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS* vars are empty, if those are related.

Any suggestions?

Thanks,

Yes superbuild is the recommended way.

Superbuild is the cmakification of the earlier Autobuild shell scripts.

It does pretty much exactly the same things autobuild did, but it is a bit
easier for us to maintain.
The last time Autobuild was updated for example was back in about the 3.14
and jaguar days.

Yes, you can apply it to 4.0.1. Do the following:

> cd ParaViewSource/VTK
> git apply [path to path file]

If you're building using source tar balls and not git, you can do the following:

> cd ParaViewSource/VTK
> patch -p1 < [path to patch file]

Subject: [Paraview] Plugin developers: update to target_link_libraries calls
	in CMake code
Message-ID: <CAMkPkZWyPai3g86xk4vTDm5pEu2344CaOUCoh8ZtsakLrijJxw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

We recently merged in some changes to VTK and ParaView that make use
of the new target_link_libraries command signature, these offer much
better control over what is a public interface library and what is a
private link. This is largely dictated by whether the thing being
linked to is exposed in the public headers/API or just used in the
implementation files.

One issue is that target_link_libraries with no arguments defaults to
making all links public, but if it is called on a target with the new
signature then that default changes to private for all previous and
subsequent calls. This is far from ideal, but it is the way it has
been added to CMake and so we must work with it. CMake 2.8.12 will
issue warnings when any target has calls with both signatures.

As a plugin developer you may need to add links to things that were
once public and are now private, such as vtksys, MPI (using
include(vtkMPI) and vtk_mpi_link(target_name)). If you want to retain
the previous behavior for your linking simply changing the call to
include LINK_PUBLIC will work,

target_link_libraries(my_plugin LINK_PUBLIC my_interface_libs
LINK_PRIVATE vtksys)

would add my_interface_libs to the public links for the target, and
vtksys to the private links. In VTK/ParaView this allows us to reduce
the length of link lines, and to reduce the number of include
directories in the search paths (can be removed for any non-public
dependencies of the module's dependencies).

We will be working to remove more libraries from the public interface
libraries going forward, and so further adjustments may be necessary.
Please ask if anything wasn't clear, inserting LINK_PUBLIC into your
calls to link libraries is all that is necessary to maintain the
previous behavior. It may be necessary to add some dependencies
explicitly that were once implicitly brought in.

Thanks,

Marcus

Hi Andy,

Just let you know that I am able to work around the error by adding an option in CMake to allow users to specify the static PhastaAdaptor lib to link to and I am able to build our simulation code linked to ParaView coprocessing successfully. Let me know if you know a better way to do it.

Thanks,
Hong

Subject: Re: [Paraview] cannot find -lvtkPVPythonCatalyst error when doing coprocessing

Hi Andy,

That seems to work well, but just to double make sure, let me copy the list of relevant coprocessing libs for 3.98 for your perusal:
----------------
libvtkCoProcessorCS-pv3.98.a
libvtkCoProcessorPython27D-pv3.98.a
libvtkCoProcessorImplementation-pv3.98.a
libvtkCoProcessorPython-pv3.98.a
libvtkCoProcessor-pv3.98.a
----------------

On a related question, now I am getting error "cannot find -lPhastaAdaptor" although I have libPhastaAdaptor.a in the lib directory. It looks like it tries to link to shared library rather than the static library. I am using "find_package(ParaView 3.98 REQUIRED COMPONENTS vtkCoProcessorImplementation PhastaAdaptor)" followed by "target_link_libraries(phastaIC.exe vtkCoProcessorImplementation PhastaAdaptor)" in CMakeLists.txt file. What else should I do or correct to make the linker to link to libPhastaAdaptor.a (as it did for other coprocessing-related static libs) rather than link to shared lib via -lPhastaAdaptor?

Thanks and best regards,
Hong

Hi Hong,

The Catalyst User's Guide corresponds to ParaView 4.0 and later. You're correct that for 3.98 you'll need to link to one of the CoProcessing libraries. If I recall correctly, you should use:

TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES(phastaIC.exe vtkCoProcessorImplementation)

If that doesn't work, can you email me the list of CoProcessing libraries in your build tree?

Regards,
Andy

When building our simulation code linked to ParaView 3.98 (built with coprocessing enabled) with CMake, I got the error "cannot find -lvtkPVPythonCatalyst" in the final linking stage. I followed Catalyst User Guide to add the following into CMakeLists.txt to handle coprocessing:

------------------------------------------
...
find_package(ParaView 3.98 REQUIRED COMPONENTS vtkPVPythonCatalyst PhastaAdaptor)
include("${PARAVIEW_USE_FILE}")
add_definitions("-DUSE_CATALYST")
...
target_link_libraries(phastaIC.exe vtkPVPythonCatalyst PhastaAdaptor)
...
------------------------------------------

I verified there is no vtkPVPythonCatalyst lib in the ParaView build, although there are a few coprocessing-related libs there in the ParaView build. Should I change vtkPVPythonCatalyst to some coprocessing-related component? If so, which component name should I use? I need to use python for pipeline handling and link catalyst to fortran code.

Thanks for any tips you can provide!

Hong

Dear ParaView users,
I have succesfully written a ParaView writer to output an unstructured grid
data set. I am using Fortran 95.
I am trying now to do exactly the same thing but writing Float64 binary

In attachment tow example of output vtu file. The frist one is ascii and I
can read it with paraview. The second one is binary and I have error when I
read it.

Any idea what's the problem?

Thank you.

Subject: [Paraview]  Performance of the CGNS Reader
Message-ID: <521F5CD6.7080308@onera.fr>

Hello.

I am testing the CGNS reader of Paraview 4.0.1 64 bits running on a 
Linux Workstation having 4 CPUs and 5.8 Gbytes of memory. Paraview was 
installed from the binaries available on the download page.

I am trying to load a 1.36 Gbytes CGNS file that is available through 
the network.

While loading this file, the Paraview Windows is frozen and cannot be 
refreshed, and I must check with the "ps" command on a terminal window 
or with a system monitor if PV  is still running or if it is really 
frozen. A progress bar for all readers would be welcome in a next release.

Finally, the file can be loaded, but it always takes about 15 mn (+ or - 
1 mn depending of the load of the network), while Tecplot always loads 
the same file within less that 1 mn !

How do you explain this poor performance of the CGNS reader ? Can it be 
improved, or am I missing something ? Is there some Paraview option that 
could reduce loading time of large files ?

Best regards

As a followup to this that may be related - does the CGNS reader through the VisItBridge work in parallel?    I've loaded up a couple of different CGNS datasets and then applied the ProcessIDScalars filter and it doesn't appear to be distributing the data - even multi-block CGNS files.

It looks like you're running afoul of VTK specific terminology. the 
designers of the VTK XML file formats have done something confusing. 
They called the format that uses base64 encoding( 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) "binary". There's an alternate 
format that can use raw binary encoding called "appended" where data 
arrays are stored at the end of the file. the "appended" format supports 
either base64 or raw binary encoding, while the "binary" format only 
supports base64.

This is documented in the file formats guide ( 
http://www.vtk.org/VTK/img/file-formats.pdf).

With your ascii formatted file you can use ParaView to generate examples 
of the other formats. Load your ascii formatted file and then use 
File->Save Data to save it as vtu in the desired format. I've done this 
to help refresh my memory about this, see the attached.

Utkarsh - I've not yet had a chance to test the patch.  A number of
misfortunes have my compile machine temporarily down and for some reason I'm
unable to get a clean build on a similar machine.   I'm working towards
being able to test your patch - but just not there yet.   I don't want you
to think that I'm ignoring your effort!

Yes, you can apply it to 4.0.1. Do the following:

> cd ParaViewSource/VTK
> git apply [path to path file]

If you're building using source tar balls and not git, you can do the
following:

> cd ParaViewSource/VTK
> patch -p1 < [path to patch file]

Your tools build is pointing to the compiler wrapper that you normally
would use to make code for the back end.
The tools build should just use plain old local gcc since we only build
things at that point that run on the login node.

Try these setup scripts:
I source configtools.sh to set up my environment before I build the compile
tools, and configcross.sh before before I cross compile ParaView.

configtools.sh
#use my own cmake, system one is too old
setenv PATH
/autofs/na4_proj/csc035/demarle/pvdev/titan/cmake-build/bin:${PATH}
#switch compiler to compile code for front end
module unload PrgEnv-pgi
module load gcc
#configure settings for to build compile tools only
cmake \
  -DCROSS_BUILD_STAGE:STRING=TOOLS -Dcross_target:STRING=xk7_gnu \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Release \
  -DBUILD_TESTING:BOOL=FALSE \
  -DParaView_FROM_GIT:BOOL=OFF \
  -DENABLE_paraview:BOOL=TRUE \
  -DENABLE_boost:BOOL=TRUE \
  -DENABLE_python:BOOL=TRUE \
  -DENABLE_portfwd:BOOL=FALSE \
  ../../ParaViewSuperbuild


then make

configcross.sh
#use my own cmake, system one is too old
setenv PATH
/autofs/na4_proj/csc035/demarle/pvdev/titan/cmake-build/bin:${PATH}
#switch compiler to compile code for back end
module unload PrgEnv-pgi
module unload gcc
module load PrgEnv-gnu
#not sure why module load wasn't sufficient, but ended up needing to force
#cmake to choose the right compiler
setenv CC /opt/cray/xt-asyncpe/5.17/bin/cc
setenv CXX /opt/cray/xt-asyncpe/5.17/bin/CC
#configure settings to cross compile python, (mesa - implied), and paraview
cmake \
  -DCROSS_BUILD_STAGE:STRING=CROSS -Dcross_target:STRING=xk7_gnu \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Release \
  -DBUILD_TESTING:BOOL=TRUE \
  -DParaView_FROM_GIT:BOOL=OFF \
  -DENABLE_paraview:BOOL=TRUE \
  -DENABLE_python:BOOL=TRUE \
  ../../ParaViewSuperbuild

then make again

Yes GNU is the preferred environment.

We don't have pgi, cray, or intel compilers submitting to the VTK and
ParaView dashboards, so the GNU toolchain is your best bet (we have an AIX
build, so xlc on bluegene's is usually pretty easy). ParaView _can_ be
compiled with the other compilers, and between Pat Marion and I'm sure
we've done them all at some point, but it is usually more of a headache and
takes longer to get a working ParaView build up because compilation
problems creep in and go undetected for long periods of time.

Note, it doesn't matter what compiler you use to build CMake. If the system
CMake is too old, I just compile it myself using gcc on the login node and
put that in my path before the system one. Note also that you can force
CMake to choose a particular compiler by setting your CC and CXX
environment variables before your first configure. From that time on, that
particular build will always use the same one.

Thanks for the update. No worries. I am making cleanups to the filter
in the mean time. So I may just send you updated versions when you're
ready to try it out again.

Hi David,

I just started to try superbuild on Titan also. I don't see you set ENABLE_MPI to be true in your configure script. Could you confirm whether ENABLE_MPI needs to be set to TRUE in order for ParaView to run on Titan in parallel? Since my purpose is to link our simulation code (already built statically with CMake on Titan) to ParaView CoProcessing libraries (I am using version 3.98.1) for in-situ visualization on Titan, so in this case, do I have to set ENABLE_paraview to true and do I need to enable OSMesa for ParaView to resort to off-screen rendering for in-situ visualization?

Although I can build ParaView from source on Titan login nodes, I am not able to run it on compute nodes, so I am starting to try superbuild hoping to be able to cross build ParaView libraries to run in-situ visualization on Titan.

Thanks,
Hong

Your tools build is pointing to the compiler wrapper that you normally would use to make code for the back end.
The tools build should just use plain old local gcc since we only build things at that point that run on the login node.

Try these setup scripts:
I source configtools.sh to set up my environment before I build the compile tools, and configcross.sh before before I cross compile ParaView.

configtools.sh
#use my own cmake, system one is too old
setenv PATH /autofs/na4_proj/csc035/demarle/pvdev/titan/cmake-build/bin:${PATH}
#switch compiler to compile code for front end
module unload PrgEnv-pgi
module load gcc
#configure settings for to build compile tools only
cmake \
  -DCROSS_BUILD_STAGE:STRING=TOOLS -Dcross_target:STRING=xk7_gnu \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Release \
  -DBUILD_TESTING:BOOL=FALSE \
  -DParaView_FROM_GIT:BOOL=OFF \
  -DENABLE_paraview:BOOL=TRUE \
  -DENABLE_boost:BOOL=TRUE \
  -DENABLE_python:BOOL=TRUE \
  -DENABLE_portfwd:BOOL=FALSE \
  ../../ParaViewSuperbuild


then make

configcross.sh
#use my own cmake, system one is too old
setenv PATH /autofs/na4_proj/csc035/demarle/pvdev/titan/cmake-build/bin:${PATH}
#switch compiler to compile code for back end
module unload PrgEnv-pgi
module unload gcc
module load PrgEnv-gnu
#not sure why module load wasn't sufficient, but ended up needing to force
#cmake to choose the right compiler
setenv CC /opt/cray/xt-asyncpe/5.17/bin/cc
setenv CXX /opt/cray/xt-asyncpe/5.17/bin/CC
#configure settings to cross compile python, (mesa - implied), and paraview
cmake \
  -DCROSS_BUILD_STAGE:STRING=CROSS -Dcross_target:STRING=xk7_gnu \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Release \
  -DBUILD_TESTING:BOOL=TRUE \
  -DParaView_FROM_GIT:BOOL=OFF \
  -DENABLE_paraview:BOOL=TRUE \
  -DENABLE_python:BOOL=TRUE \
  ../../ParaViewSuperbuild

then make again

Hi, I'm trying to follow the advice on building ParaView on Titan using the ParaViewSuperbuild method from an earlier discussion in June.

When I run make in the "TOOLS" directory I get the following error:

I don't see a BUILD_SHARED that I can toggle. All of the CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS* vars are empty, if those are related.

Any suggestions?

Thanks,

The ENABLE_MPI flag at the Superbuild level is unrelated. It has a purpose
only when CROSS_BUILD_STAGE=HOST, that is when making ParaView binary
installers for desktops from Superbuild.

You shouldn't turn it on in the TOOLS or CROSS stages. Instead let the
CROSS stage use the system installed MPI. It does that by turning
PARAVIEW_USE_MPI=ON when it configures the ParaView sub-build. See
CMake/crosscompile/xk7_gnu to see where it does that, and to see the other
flags it uses.

The CROSS stage turns on Python, Mesa and ParaView. Titan's accelerators
don't really run X11, so Mesa is the only option for rendering there.

I've cross compiled Catalyst itself before on a bluegene. I did it manually
before SuperBuild existed. I will see if I can dig up my config scripts.
Cross compiling Catalyst should be more or less that same thing as cross
compiling ParaView, but a bit faster and easier because their is less code
involved.

Hello,

First, the CGNS reader coming through the VisItBridge is not working in 
parallel, it's a plain serial reader.
Second, there are limitations to the current cgns reader way of doing 
thing, since :
   - At the beginning, it parses the whole file (this takes a lot of 
time) to get variable names, blocks and so on, before actually reading 
the data.  [ I think that tecplot is cleaner because it seems to read 
the whole CGNS file in one pass ]
  - meshes are read in a temporary array and converted to a VTK vector 
of coordinates (thus memory manipulation)
  - for unstructured meshes, convertion from 'integer' to 'long' of 
cells connectivity eats memory.
The CGNS reader can improve but at the cost of redesining some parts to 
fit better in paraview and go for parallel.

So coprocessing will not be built using the below instructions? I would have mentioned that, but coprocessing appears to still be part of a regular, non-cross-compile build, so I figured it was part of ENABLE_paraview

Also, for the below configcross.sh, do we need to pass in a CMake variable telling it where the tools build dir is located?
Thanks,
Mark

Your tools build is pointing to the compiler wrapper that you normally would use to make code for the back end.
The tools build should just use plain old local gcc since we only build things at that point that run on the login node.

Try these setup scripts:
I source configtools.sh to set up my environment before I build the compile tools, and configcross.sh before before I cross compile ParaView.

configtools.sh
#use my own cmake, system one is too old
setenv PATH /autofs/na4_proj/csc035/demarle/pvdev/titan/cmake-build/bin:${PATH}
#switch compiler to compile code for front end
module unload PrgEnv-pgi
module load gcc
#configure settings for to build compile tools only

  -DENABLE_paraview:BOOL=TRUE \

then make

The coprocessing plugin, which adds things to the GUI to make it easy to
record coprocessing pipeline setups doesn't need to be turned on since that
lives in the client only. (It is like python trace or state recording, but
tailored to recording in-situ setups).

Catalyst (the stripped down version of ParaView server that a simulation
code can link to and use to run those recorded pipelines quickly) is not
yet an option in ParaViewSuperbuild. To cross compile Catalyst a bit more
work will be required. It will follow the same plan as how the ParaView
server is compiled, but I just haven't tried it. When I did cross compile
Catalyst last year at this time I did the same steps that
ParaViewSuperbuild's TOOLS and CROSS build passes did, just by hand.

That should be an option that you can easily set, but it isn't sorry.

 CMake/CrossCompilationMacros.cmake assumes it can find it one directory up
and over like so:
macro(find_hosttools)
  set(PARAVIEW_HOSTTOOLS_DIR
${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/../tools/paraview/src/paraview-build/ CACHE PATH
    "Location of host built paraview compile tools directory")
  set(PYTHON_HOST_EXE ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/../tools/install/bin/python CACHE
PATH
    "Location of host built python executable")
  set(PYTHON_HOST_LIBDIR ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/../tools/install/lib CACHE PATH
    "Location of host built python libraries")
  set(BOOST_HOST_INCLUDEDIR ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/../tools/install/include
CACHE PATH
    "Location of host built boost headers")
endmacro()

You could predefine all four of those if you like.

Thank you for this answer, Mickael.

My 1.36 Gb CGNS dataset is built from structured meshes and Paraview 
should not 'eat' too much memory. I have checked that enabling 
multi-core in Paraview does not change anything: PV always needs about 
15 mn to load my dataset, same loading time as without multi-core.

I think that the loading time ratio 15 mn / 1 mn for PV against Tecplot 
remains too high, even if PV parses the file two times. If Tecplot takes 
advantage from multi-core (I don't know), the loading time ratio between 
PV and Tecplot should not excess 8 when using 4 CPUs. A ratio of 15 
leading to 15 mn of loading time or more for larger datasets is 
unacceptable for interactivity. So PV is unusable for large CGNS 
datasets, unless using batch mode. I think that an effort in redesigning 
the CGNS reader would be welcome.

Best regards.

Richard

Subject: [Paraview] pvserver with POE
Message-ID: <201308301027.18668.rugeri@idris.fr>

Hi,

I have some  difficulties  to use pvserver running under IBM's native
Parallel Operating Environment (POE).
It looks like pvserver is failing to opening up a server-socket  
to which the paraview clients are expected.

$ poe pvserver -procs 2

produce the following error message:
Waiting for client...
Connection URL: cs://ada258:11111
Waiting for client...
Connection URL: cs://ada258:11111

Exiting...

It's work fine with mpirun  (Intel MPI Library) 
 
$ mpirun -np 2 pvserver

Any ideas ?

Hi,

Can you let me know whether it is BG P or BG Q on which catalyst was built.

Thanks,

That was a P.

When Mira at ANL ( a Q ) came out a few months ago, I briefly attempted to
port the xlc_bgp config into an xlc_bgq config, but got bogged down in
miscellaneous compilation issues and put it on hold.

It won't be that hard to do, it just takes a more time and patience than I
had at the time.

Message-ID: <de072b9796d647319644c76cda14f998@BLUPR02MB178.namprd02.prod.outlook.com>

Dear Paraview Community,

I am volume rendering a 2560 x 2160 x 200 image stack that totals 2 GB in size.  The stack loads fine, Paraview consistently crashes when I try to render the whole volume.  The data is represented as a uniform grid.  I don't think this is a memory issue.  I have monitored memory usage during crashes and the system always has at least 29 GB of free memory when it crashes.  The behavior is the same regardless of which rendering algorithm I choose (smart, ray cast, texture mapping, GPU).  I have tried loading the data in both RAW format and NRRD format with no luck.  I am using the Linux 64 bit binary installation from the Paraview website.  My desktop is running CentOS.

I'd appreciate any advice you might have for me.

Thanks,
Cody

Hi Cody,

I've had a similar experience and it was because I had a limited stack size in the shell I was launching paraview from. Try checking ulimit -a

Hope that helps,

I tried to follow the instructions and the configuration scripts to build ParaView for compute nodes on Titan. It built successfully without issues for the TOOLS stage, but when doing final linking for paraview in the CROSS stage, I got numerous similar linking error from different lines such as the following:

----------------
/....../ParaView/ParaViewSuperbuild/cross/paraview/src/paraview/Utilities/mpi4py/src/mpi4py.MPI.c: In function '__pyx_pf_6mpi4py_3MPI_4File_54Sync':
/....../ParaView/ParaViewSuperbuild/cross/paraview/src/paraview/Utilities/mpi4py/src/mpi4py.MPI.c:89682:7: error: '_save' undeclared (first use in this function)
----------------

The same error message were raised from the same file mpi4py.MPI.c from different lines.

I am using CMake version 2.8.10.2 which is provided by Titan, and using the ParaView source tree version 3.98 with one additional filter I have developed.

Any idea on what could cause the linking error?

Thanks,
Hong

To cross compile Catalyst a bit more work will be required. It will follow the same plan as how the ParaView server is compiled, but I just haven't tried it. When I did cross compile Catalyst last year at this time I did the same steps that ParaViewSuperbuild's TOOLS and CROSS build passes did, just by hand.

Also, for the below configcross.sh, do we need to pass in a CMake variable telling it where the tools build dir is located?

That should be an option that you can easily set, but it isn't sorry.

 CMake/CrossCompilationMacros.cmake assumes it can find it one directory up and over like so:
macro(find_hosttools)
  set(PARAVIEW_HOSTTOOLS_DIR ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/../tools/paraview/src/paraview-build/ CACHE PATH
    "Location of host built paraview compile tools directory")
  set(PYTHON_HOST_EXE ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/../tools/install/bin/python CACHE PATH
    "Location of host built python executable")
  set(PYTHON_HOST_LIBDIR ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/../tools/install/lib CACHE PATH
    "Location of host built python libraries")
  set(BOOST_HOST_INCLUDEDIR ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/../tools/install/include CACHE PATH
    "Location of host built boost headers")
endmacro()

You could predefine all four of those if you like.

You shouldn't turn it on in the TOOLS or CROSS stages. Instead let the CROSS stage use the system installed MPI. It does that by turning PARAVIEW_USE_MPI=ON when it configures the ParaView sub-build. See CMake/crosscompile/xk7_gnu to see where it does that, and to see the other flags it uses.

I've cross compiled Catalyst itself before on a bluegene. I did it manually before SuperBuild existed. I will see if I can dig up my config scripts. Cross compiling Catalyst should be more or less that same thing as cross compiling ParaView, but a bit faster and easier because their is less code involved.



Thanks,
Hong

Your tools build is pointing to the compiler wrapper that you normally would use to make code for the back end.

The tools build should just use plain old local gcc since we only build things at that point that run on the login node.



Try these setup scripts:

I source configtools.sh to set up my environment before I build the compile tools, and configcross.sh before before I cross compile ParaView.



configtools.sh

#use my own cmake, system one is too old

setenv PATH /autofs/na4_proj/csc035/demarle/pvdev/titan/cmake-build/bin:${PATH}

#switch compiler to compile code for front end

module unload PrgEnv-pgi

module load gcc

#configure settings for to build compile tools only

cmake \

  -DCROSS_BUILD_STAGE:STRING=TOOLS -Dcross_target:STRING=xk7_gnu \

  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Release \

  -DBUILD_TESTING:BOOL=FALSE \

  -DParaView_FROM_GIT:BOOL=OFF \

  -DENABLE_paraview:BOOL=TRUE \

  -DENABLE_boost:BOOL=TRUE \

  -DENABLE_python:BOOL=TRUE \

  -DENABLE_portfwd:BOOL=FALSE \

  ../../ParaViewSuperbuild





then make



configcross.sh

#use my own cmake, system one is too old

setenv PATH /autofs/na4_proj/csc035/demarle/pvdev/titan/cmake-build/bin:${PATH}

#switch compiler to compile code for back end

module unload PrgEnv-pgi

module unload gcc

module load PrgEnv-gnu

#not sure why module load wasn't sufficient, but ended up needing to force

#cmake to choose the right compiler

setenv CC /opt/cray/xt-asyncpe/5.17/bin/cc

setenv CXX /opt/cray/xt-asyncpe/5.17/bin/CC

#configure settings to cross compile python, (mesa - implied), and paraview

cmake \

  -DCROSS_BUILD_STAGE:STRING=CROSS -Dcross_target:STRING=xk7_gnu \

Looking more closely, it seems like ParaViewSuperbuild does build catalyst, at least the libs are getting built:

vanmoer at titan-ext3:~/builds/superbuild/cross/paraview/src/paraview-build/lib> ls *Catalyst*
libvtkPVCatalystCS-pv4.0.a         libvtkPVCatalystPython-pv4.0.a         libvtkPVPythonCatalystPython-pv4.0.a
libvtkPVCatalyst-pv4.0.a           libvtkPVPythonCatalyst-pv4.0.a
libvtkPVCatalystPython27D-pv4.0.a  libvtkPVPythonCatalystPythonD-pv4.0.a

I was able to compile by hunting down all the headers, but not link.

I tried adding -DPARAVIEW_INSTALL_DEVELOPMENT_FILES:BOOL=TRUE to configcross.sh but I get

CMake Warning:
  Manually-specified variables were not used by the project:

    PARAVIEW_INSTALL_DEVELOPMENT_FILES

is this because there's no paraviewsdk.cmake in ParaViewSuperbuild/Projects?

I tried to follow the instructions and the configuration scripts to build ParaView for compute nodes on Titan. It built successfully without issues for the TOOLS stage, but when doing final linking for paraview in the CROSS stage, I got numerous similar linking error from different lines such as the following:

----------------
/....../ParaView/ParaViewSuperbuild/cross/paraview/src/paraview/Utilities/mpi4py/src/mpi4py.MPI.c: In function '__pyx_pf_6mpi4py_3MPI_4File_54Sync':

----------------

The same error message were raised from the same file mpi4py.MPI.c from different lines.

I am using CMake version 2.8.10.2 which is provided by Titan, and using the ParaView source tree version 3.98 with one additional filter I have developed.

Any idea on what could cause the linking error?

Thanks,
Hong

Catalyst (the stripped down version of ParaView server that a simulation code can link to and use to run those recorded pipelines quickly) is not yet an option in ParaViewSuperbuild. To cross compile Catalyst a bit more work will be required. It will follow the same plan as how the ParaView server is compiled, but I just haven't tried it. When I did cross compile Catalyst last year at this time I did the same steps that ParaViewSuperbuild's TOOLS and CROSS build passes did, just by hand.
Also, for the below configcross.sh, do we need to pass in a CMake variable telling it where the tools build dir is located?

That should be an option that you can easily set, but it isn't sorry.

 CMake/CrossCompilationMacros.cmake assumes it can find it one directory up and over like so:
macro(find_hosttools)
  set(PARAVIEW_HOSTTOOLS_DIR ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/../tools/paraview/src/paraview-build/ CACHE PATH
    "Location of host built paraview compile tools directory")
  set(PYTHON_HOST_EXE ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/../tools/install/bin/python CACHE PATH
    "Location of host built python executable")
  set(PYTHON_HOST_LIBDIR ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/../tools/install/lib CACHE PATH
    "Location of host built python libraries")
  set(BOOST_HOST_INCLUDEDIR ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/../tools/install/include CACHE PATH
    "Location of host built boost headers")
endmacro()

You could predefine all four of those if you like.

The ENABLE_MPI flag at the Superbuild level is unrelated. It has a purpose only when CROSS_BUILD_STAGE=HOST, that is when making ParaView binary installers for desktops from Superbuild.

You shouldn't turn it on in the TOOLS or CROSS stages. Instead let the CROSS stage use the system installed MPI. It does that by turning PARAVIEW_USE_MPI=ON when it configures the ParaView sub-build. See CMake/crosscompile/xk7_gnu to see where it does that, and to see the other flags it uses.

simulation code (already built statically with CMake on Titan) to ParaView CoProcessing libraries (I am using version 3.98.1) for in-situ visualization on Titan, so in this case, do I have to set ENABLE_paraview to true and do I need to enable OSMesa for ParaView to resort to off-screen rendering for in-situ visualization?

The CROSS stage turns on Python, Mesa and ParaView. Titan's accelerators don't really run X11, so Mesa is the only option for rendering there.

Although I can build ParaView from source on Titan login nodes, I am not able to run it on compute nodes, so I am starting to try superbuild hoping to be able to cross build ParaView libraries to run in-situ visualization on Titan.

I've cross compiled Catalyst itself before on a bluegene. I did it manually before SuperBuild existed. I will see if I can dig up my config scripts. Cross compiling Catalyst should be more or less that same thing as cross compiling ParaView, but a bit faster and easier because their is less code involved.

Thanks,
Hong

Your tools build is pointing to the compiler wrapper that you normally would use to make code for the back end.
The tools build should just use plain old local gcc since we only build things at that point that run on the login node.

Try these setup scripts:
I source configtools.sh to set up my environment before I build the compile tools, and configcross.sh before before I cross compile ParaView.

configtools.sh
#use my own cmake, system one is too old
setenv PATH /autofs/na4_proj/csc035/demarle/pvdev/titan/cmake-build/bin:${PATH}
#switch compiler to compile code for front end
module unload PrgEnv-pgi
module load gcc
#configure settings for to build compile tools only

Thanks for the info, Mark. Looks like it is sensible for me to try newer version of CMake 2.8.11.2 and see how it goes.

On a somewhat related question: I am trying to pass in some CMake flags to make it build my new filter plugin as well as FortranAdaptor for coprocessing (yes, I discovered also that coprocessing/catalyst is built by default by superbuild, but FortranAdaptor is turned off by default). I tried to pass it in by adding corresponding -D to configuretools, but got CMake warning as well indicating those manually-specified variables were not used. I am wondering whether I can do it by directly changing CMakeCache.txt under paraview/src/paraview-build to force the corresponding flags to be on...

Hong

Subject: [Paraview] viewing Gadget2 simulations
Message-ID: <52211C24.5010509@astro.wisc.edu>

Greetings, all.

I am a PhD student in astrophysics at the University of 
Wisconsin-Madison working on dynamics simulations with Gadget2. To test 
my setup, I ran the galaxy collision simulation included with the 
Gadget2 distribution, and generated a sequence of snapshots. I am trying 
to view these snapshots in Paraview (3.98.0-enhanced 64-bit), but I 
cannot see the position vector data. The object inspector only shows the 
ghost, mass, tag, and velocity fields. Using the snapshot extraction 
codes provided with the Gadget2 distribution, I was able to see that the 
position data is indeed present in the snapshot files.

Has anyone had the problem before?

I have searched through the mailing list archives, read through the 
user's manual, and read over the 2011 ApJ paper, all to no avail.

Many thanks for your help in advance.

- Tim

Hi Tim,

I believe the position vector is used as the xyz position of the particles
that are being rendered, so, you cannot color by the position. Do you see
any particles when you open the file?

Best,
George

Just a quick update. Like Mark, I can build ParaView 4.0.1 with Superbuild successfully without issues using CMake 2.8.11.2 on Titan. However, I cannot build Paraview 3.98.1 with Superbuild using the same CMake version. I still got the same linking error from mpi4py.MPI.c in the final stage of linking after 100% built for the cross stage (see below for details) if I built version 3.98.1 using superbuild. Perhaps the latest version of Superbuild has some sort of incompatibility with the older version of ParaView for xk7_gnu target? Anyway, looks like we have to go with the latest ParaView version for in-situ visualization on Titan since superbuild does not work with older 3.98.1 version for us, which may very well prove a good thing for us in the long run due to a lot of improvement made on Catalyst in the latest ParaView version.

Thanks,
Hong

Thanks for the info, Mark. Looks like it is sensible for me to try newer version of CMake 2.8.11.2 and see how it goes.

On a somewhat related question: I am trying to pass in some CMake flags to make it build my new filter plugin as well as FortranAdaptor for coprocessing (yes, I discovered also that coprocessing/catalyst is built by default by superbuild, but FortranAdaptor is turned off by default). I tried to pass it in by adding corresponding ?D to configuretools, but got CMake warning as well indicating those manually-specified variables were not used. I am wondering whether I can do it by directly changing CMakeCache.txt under paraview/src/paraview-build to force the corresponding flags to be on?

Thanks,
Hong

Hi Hong,
I was able to get David?s instructions to work using CMake 2.8.11.2 and ParaView 4.0.1. The build process seems to be sensitive to versions.

I tried to follow the instructions and the configuration scripts to build ParaView for compute nodes on Titan. It built successfully without issues for the TOOLS stage, but when doing final linking for paraview in the CROSS stage, I got numerous similar linking error from different lines such as the following:

----------------
/....../ParaView/ParaViewSuperbuild/cross/paraview/src/paraview/Utilities/mpi4py/src/mpi4py.MPI.c: In function '__pyx_pf_6mpi4py_3MPI_4File_54Sync':
/....../ParaView/ParaViewSuperbuild/cross/paraview/src/paraview/Utilities/mpi4py/src/mpi4py.MPI.c:89682:7: error: '_save' undeclared (first use in this function)
----------------

The same error message were raised from the same file mpi4py.MPI.c from different lines.

I am using CMake version 2.8.10.2 which is provided by Titan, and using the ParaView source tree version 3.98 with one additional filter I have developed.

Any idea on what could cause the linking error?

Thanks,
Hong

So coprocessing will not be built using the below instructions? I would have mentioned that, but coprocessing appears to
still be part of a regular, non-cross-compile build, so I figured it was part of ENABLE_paraview

The coprocessing plugin, which adds things to the GUI to make it easy to record coprocessing pipeline setups doesn't need to be turned on since that lives in the client only. (It is like python trace or state recording, but tailored to recording in-situ setups).

Catalyst (the stripped down version of ParaView server that a simulation code can link to and use to run those recorded pipelines quickly) is not yet an option in ParaViewSuperbuild. To cross compile Catalyst a bit more work will be required. It will follow the same plan as how the ParaView server is compiled, but I just haven't tried it. When I did cross compile Catalyst last year at this time I did the same steps that ParaViewSuperbuild's TOOLS and CROSS build passes did, just by hand.
Also, for the below configcross.sh, do we need to pass in a CMake variable telling it where the tools build dir is located?

That should be an option that you can easily set, but it isn't sorry.

 CMake/CrossCompilationMacros.cmake assumes it can find it one directory up and over like so:
macro(find_hosttools)
  set(PARAVIEW_HOSTTOOLS_DIR ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/../tools/paraview/src/paraview-build/ CACHE PATH
    "Location of host built paraview compile tools directory")
  set(PYTHON_HOST_EXE ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/../tools/install/bin/python CACHE PATH
    "Location of host built python executable")
  set(PYTHON_HOST_LIBDIR ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/../tools/install/lib CACHE PATH
    "Location of host built python libraries")
  set(BOOST_HOST_INCLUDEDIR ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/../tools/install/include CACHE PATH
    "Location of host built boost headers")
endmacro()

You could predefine all four of those if you like.

Thanks,
Mark

Hi David,

I just started to try superbuild on Titan also. I don't see you set ENABLE_MPI to be true in your configure script. Could you confirm whether ENABLE_MPI needs to be set to TRUE in order for ParaView to run on Titan in parallel? Since my purpose is to link our

The ENABLE_MPI flag at the Superbuild level is unrelated. It has a purpose only when CROSS_BUILD_STAGE=HOST, that is when making ParaView binary installers for desktops from Superbuild.

You shouldn't turn it on in the TOOLS or CROSS stages. Instead let the CROSS stage use the system installed MPI. It does that by turning PARAVIEW_USE_MPI=ON when it configures the ParaView sub-build. See CMake/crosscompile/xk7_gnu to see where it does that, and to see the other flags it uses.

simulation code (already built statically with CMake on Titan) to ParaView CoProcessing libraries (I am using version 3.98.1) for in-situ visualization on Titan, so in this case, do I have to set ENABLE_paraview to true and do I need to enable OSMesa for ParaView to resort to off-screen rendering for in-situ visualization?

The CROSS stage turns on Python, Mesa and ParaView. Titan's accelerators don't really run X11, so Mesa is the only option for rendering there.

Although I can build ParaView from source on Titan login nodes, I am not able to run it on compute nodes, so I am starting to try superbuild hoping to be able to cross build ParaView libraries to run in-situ visualization on Titan.

I've cross compiled Catalyst itself before on a bluegene. I did it manually before SuperBuild existed. I will see if I can dig up my config scripts. Cross compiling Catalyst should be more or less that same thing as cross compiling ParaView, but a bit faster and easier because their is less code involved.

Thanks,
Hong

Your tools build is pointing to the compiler wrapper that you normally would use to make code for the back end.
The tools build should just use plain old local gcc since we only build things at that point that run on the login node.

Try these setup scripts:
I source configtools.sh to set up my environment before I build the compile tools, and configcross.sh before before I cross compile ParaView.

configtools.sh
#use my own cmake, system one is too old
setenv PATH /autofs/na4_proj/csc035/demarle/pvdev/titan/cmake-build/bin:${PATH}
#switch compiler to compile code for front end
module unload PrgEnv-pgi
module load gcc
#configure settings for to build compile tools only
cmake \
  -DCROSS_BUILD_STAGE:STRING=TOOLS -Dcross_target:STRING=xk7_gnu \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Release \
  -DBUILD_TESTING:BOOL=FALSE \
  -DParaView_FROM_GIT:BOOL=OFF \
  -DENABLE_paraview:BOOL=TRUE \
  -DENABLE_boost:BOOL=TRUE \
  -DENABLE_python:BOOL=TRUE \
  -DENABLE_portfwd:BOOL=FALSE \
  ../../ParaViewSuperbuild


then make

configcross.sh
#use my own cmake, system one is too old
setenv PATH /autofs/na4_proj/csc035/demarle/pvdev/titan/cmake-build/bin:${PATH}
#switch compiler to compile code for back end

setenv CC /opt/cray/xt-asyncpe/5.17/bin/cc
setenv CXX /opt/cray/xt-asyncpe/5.17/bin/CC
#configure settings to cross compile python, (mesa - implied), and paraview

@David,

I put a snapshot file on github ( 
https://github.com/hainest/Gadget2_test). Let me know if you need more 
of them.

@George,

My apologies, I realize now that my description wasn't specific enough. 
I put a screenshot of the snapshot in the github repo I linked above. 
When I color the particles by mass, it appears that they are being 
rendered using the velocity values rather than the position values to 
determine their coordinate in the volume. I hope that clarifies things a 
bit more.

Many thanks for all of your help!

- Tim
