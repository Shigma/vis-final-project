Hello Utkarsh.

I attach an archive tar.gz file that contains two short structured 
datasets and two pvsm state files:

* dataset1.tp = ASCII Tecplot file that contains an IxJ structured surface.
* dataset2.tp = ASCII Tecplot file that contains an IxJ structured 
surface having a common boundary with the first one.
* merge.pvsm: reproduces the bad plot with missing part of surface after 
MergeBlocks.
* merge420.pvsm : no missing part after MergeBlocks, but error message.

"merge.pvsm" and "merge420.pvsm" contain the same simple pipeline, but 
components were added in a different order.

Richard

as discussed with Utkarsh, this is most likely related to a bug about structured extents in version 4.2

I created a reproducer and filled a bug

Good day.

For the settings I used your instruction online
http://www.paraview.org/ParaView3/Doc/Nightly/www/js-doc/index.html#!/guide/ubuntu_14_04
.
Did everything there. Would you say it does not work?

Subject: [Paraview] Setting default Glyph Type to Sphere
Message-ID: <4E09FD4309849147BFDAED6FAAC87A956984DEF3@EP1EXMB005.corp.halliburton.com>

Hi everyone,

I would like to set the Glyph filter Glyph Type to be Sphere by default. I've read through the blog post about setting defaults in Paraview 4.2 (http://www.kitware.com/blog/home/post/702) but have been unsuccessful in my attempts to set this default either through the GUI or using a JSON config file.

Is it possible to set the Glyph Type to be Sphere by default? And if so, what JSON syntax is needed to achieve this?

Many thanks,

Tom

Tom,

Alas, the settings custom defaults work for most, but not all
properties. This is one of those properties for which it does not
work, unfortunately. One of my goals for the next release is to make
custom defaults work for properties such as these.

Best regards,
Cory

Tom,

No, there is not a way to tell that at this time.

I'd suggest downloading the 4.2 binaries from paraview.org. That may
be easier. 3.14 is too old by now.

The launcher config file you sent to the list was missing a "visualizer"
entry, but those instructions have one.  Other than that, are things

Cheers,
Scott

Subject: [Paraview] paraview book next edition - you work immortalized as
	the cover image?
Message-ID: <CANjZAi_Ouxo7=B1hQza=hEeVo4P8Mooycv_g+r5aQzN9=BgwyA@mail.gmail.com>

Hey group,

The text for the next (completely revamped) edition of the Paraview guide
is nearing completion.

One of the last things on our todo list is to select a stunning cover image.

I am quite partial to the cover of the current e-book edition (details
below). But, if you would like you work immortalized, are OK with us using
the image on the book and in the web page, and think you can do better than
Greg and Arno did, please let us know about it by sending comm at kitware.com
an email.

In the email, please have "paraview book cover" in the subject somewhere,
include the text that you want us to use to credit you and a description of
the science behind the pretty picture. Oh, and don't forget to attach the
proposed image.


?
Image courtesy of Greg Schussman and Arno Candel of the Advanced Computations
Department at SLAC. It is a visualization of an electromagnetic simulation
performed at SLAC of a key component of a new particle accelerator
being designed
at CERN.  In the visualization, the propagation of electric fields excited
by decelerated particles is shown via the blue to red rainbow color map.

cheers, thanks, and good luck!

Utkarsh,

I can confirm the same crash with the binary you refer to.  Note that AVFoundation framework was added in OS X 10.7.

Sounds good. We'll track it down. I am sure we bungled things up when
adding the sysroot fixes to get things working with Mavericks.

Sigh! Why isn't everyone just using Linux yet! :)

Simon,

Attached is a patch. It basically disables the "install" failing components 
with the Qt components are not being built. Let me know if that works and I 
can have these changes merged into the repository.

Bingo! It now works precisely as expected.

Thanks!

Subject: [Paraview] -std=c++11 for a single directory?
Message-ID: <542C4904.9000202@xs4all.nl>

Hi,

For a new plugin i'm currently writing, I'm using features of c++11.
In order to do so, I need to specify the flag  -std=c++11 to the gcc
compiler.
So far, I'm only able to achieve this by adding the flag -std=c++11 to
the file "flags.make" appearing in a subdirectory of CMakeFiles in the
*build* directory tree. This works, but this flags.cmake is overwritten
every time a new configuration is done (e.g. after a change in
CMakelist.txt).

Where can I specify compile flags that only hold for a given directory?

Kind Regards,
Bertwim

You need to force cache the CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS variable with c++11 in the
CMakeLists.txt for the plugin.

You should be aware of the potential ABI incompatibilities in the
c++11 and c++98 libstdc++ library (
https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Cxx11AbiCompatibility ). Plus the fact this
won't work with clang as they are ABI incompatible.

Triggered by your suggestion (CMake is still largely terra incognita for
me), I googled a bit, finding that your suggestion boils down to adding

set( CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "-std=c++11" )

to the CMakeList.txt. It worked! Thanks.

Also, I was not ware of the potential incompatibilities, so thanks for
the warning.
So far I haven't encountered any issues, but it is good to be aware.
In the mean time, I hope ParaView will have the c++11 enabled soon.
The new language features are too important to be missed!

Regards,
Bertweim

Thanks Ken.

The subdivision filter you suggest does help by making the edges a bit
blurred. Looking at the exact values though I have realized that it is a
more fundamental issue. I am looking into other options like
post-processing the contour with some kind of interpolation.

Subject: [Paraview] Is the VIEW-UP vector updated automatically?
Message-ID: <20141002.151802.248776726.furutaka.kazuyoshi@jaea.go.jp>

Dear ParaView expert...

I'm using ParaView Version 4.2.0 32-bit on linux (Fedora 20,
i386).

Is the view-up vector updated automatically after
e.g. changing the camera position?

>From Python Shell, I got the following result:

...resetting...
Python 2.7.5 (default, Sep 25 2014, 13:58:10) 
[GCC 4.8.3 20140911 (Red Hat 4.8.3-7)] on linux2
>>> from paraview.simple import *
>>> box=Box()
>>> Show(box)
<paraview.servermanager.CompositeMultiSliceRepresentation object at 0xad91dcc>
>>> cam=GetActiveCamera()
>>> cam.SetPosition(0,3,3)
>>> Render()
<paraview.servermanager.SliceView object at 0xad91bac>
>>> cam.GetViewUp()
(0.0, 1.0, 0.0)
>>> 

Is this correct behavior?
Who/what routine/method is responsible for updating the
vector?

I'm observing a curious behavior of paraview.simple.Azimuth();
camera is NOT moving left/right.

Thanks in advance.

Good day.

Sorry. Not the file sent.
Attach desired.
Everything worked.
But there are a couple of questions.

Why update the browser page when it loses the session? Starts a new process in
nature. Is there any way to fix this?

When you disable the client (browser), the session remains on the server to
hang. How to deal with it?

When you connect multiple clients, very often produces the message:
"Session did not start before timeout expired. Check session logs."
Add a log file with errors, unless of course it will help. What could the
reason for this?

Sincerely, Ilya

Subject: [Paraview] Property Panel and Inheritance?
Message-ID: <542D2C9D.5010506@xs4all.nl>

Hello, I'm struggling with getting the properties panel right for a new
Source defined in plugin that I'm writing.

In the class below, I'm extending the VTK class for a rectangular box,
vtkCubeSource. The class also derives from another class,
that has the well known method  "foo".   I have made corresponding
changes to the server manager file (xml), given below.

In the xml-file, I can specify the panel entries for the vtkCubeSource,
referring to the methods of this vtk class which are available via
inheritance, for instance "SetXLength(double)". However, when I do the
same for the method "foo(int)" of the other base class, ParaView bombs,
telling me that:

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
tkPVSessionCore (0x113a740): Object type: sphBoxSource, could not find
requested method: "foo"
or the method was called with incorrect arguments.

while processing
Message 0 = Invoke
  Argument 0 = vtk_object_pointer {sphBoxSource (0x30fbe00)}
  Argument 1 = string_value {foo}
  Argument 2 = int32_value {1024}
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

The problem is gone when I provide the derived class also with a method
"foo", which calls the "foo" of the base class.
In short, I can refer, in the panel, to the methods of vtkCubeSource (as
expected due to inheritance), but not for the other base class.
What am I overlooking here, and what do I need to do to have the
expected inheritance?

Your view
Kind Regards,
Bertwim
---------------------


This is my class:
=====================================
class sphBoxSource : public vtkCubeSource
                                 , public SPHParticleProps
{
public:
  static sphBoxSource* New();
   vtkTypeMacro(sphBoxSource,vtkCubeSource);

public:
   sphBoxSource( double, double, double );
   ~sphBoxSource();

public:  // testing purposes only
   void foo( int i ){ SPHParticleProps::foo(i);}   // For the Properties
pane,: Why can I can not just inherit the method "foo"?
};
=======================================

The server manager configuration is taken from "sources.xml" that comes
with ParaView (4.2), but extended with a property for "foo".

=======================================
<ServerManagerConfiguration>

Hi all,
I just downloaded the new version of Paraview, and I am very curious about the new features. Unfortunately I cannot use the new python trace, because as soon I click ok in the trace window, the application crashes.
Actually, the problem is already at startup, opening a python shell I get this error:

Thanks for reporting. We'll test it out. BTW, do you have any plugins
loaded when you're trying to one the Python shell?

I can't remember if the wrapping code can handle multiple inheritance.
If you removed the second superclass, does that work?

Also look the sphBoxSourceClientServer.h file generated in your build
directory. That will indicate which methods from this class are
getting wrapped and which ones aren't.

It seems to work. Inheritance of the vtkCubeSource methods just works.
Also when I reverse the inheritance order, or when I have single
inheritance (of vtkCubeSource), in the xml-file I can just refer to the
methods of the base class vtkCubeSource (say SetLength()) and it works.
But not so for the oher base class!

So I *think* I am using the two baseclasses the same way, the effect
however, is asymmetrial.

I looked, as you suggested,  into sphBoxSourceClientServer.h  The
methods of the baseclasses (vtkCubeSource), e.g. SetXLength(), do not
show-up there either. But it works, so that might not be the place where
to look.

Any other ideas?

Regards,
Bertwim

It will only warp the 1 base. I'd suggest using a proxy pattern rather
than multiple inheritance.

Subject: [Paraview] default representation?
Message-ID: <542D58E7.1020905@xs4all.nl>

Hello,

I noticed that sources like a box, sphere etc., are always displayed
initially with a surface representation, after which ione can set it
manually to something else, e.g. a wireframe. Where is this preference
being set? I cannot find it in the sources.xml file or in any of the
other xml files, but maybe I don't recognise it.

Background of this is that I would like to change this default
behaviour, in particular for some new sources I'm creating in a plugin.
(The sources that are derived from the standard ones.)

Kind Regards,
Bertwim

Subject: [Paraview] default representation?
Message-ID: <D052C1E8.1CBBD%kmorel@sandia.gov>

The default representation is based more on the data type than the filter
setup. I forget all the rules, but I believe that structured data types
(like uniform and non-uniform rectilinear grids and curvilinear grids)
default to outline. Unstructured data types (like poly data or
unstructured grids) default to surface unless the size is larger than some
threshold (which can be changed in settings). Multiblock data sets default
to whatever is appropriate for the data type in the blocks.


The rational for this behavior is that an unstructured data type likely
represents some geometry of importance whereas a regular grid more likely
represents some region in space where the relevant structure is internal.

Hi,

I'm using paraview (4.1.0) with OpenFOAM 2.3.0 and "parafoam".  I noticed
my "python shell" under my parafoam "tool" menu is not activated (with an
appearance "gray").   I wonder if you can tell me what I need to do to
turn the python shell on.  I tried with "makeParaView -python" and it
didn't go through the "make".  So I guess that is not a legitimate syntax.


Many thanks.

James

Thanks for reporting. We'll test it out. BTW, do you have any plugins
loaded when you're trying to one the Python shell?

Hi Utkarsh,

Not sure how to do that, really in Paraview. The relationshop and
dynamics between what is in the xml file, source files I write and
generated files by mysterious macros make me still a bit uncomfortable
in finding my way in ParaView.   
Maybe you could a bit more verbose?

Regards,
Bertwim

You can specify which filters you would like to make available to
ParaViewWeb using the "--proxies" argument to the pv_web_visualizer.py.  By
default ParaViewWeb can use all the filters listed in
"defaultProxies.json", which is located in your build or install tree under
site-packages/paraview/web/.  You can use this one as an example to create
your own.  You can find out about the filters by looking at filters.xml in
the source tree (ParaViewCore/ServerManager/SMApplication/Resources/).  You
can read more about the filters on the wiki:

http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Users_Guide/List_of_filters

Hope this helps.

Cheers,
Scott

In other words, just don't use mutliple inheritance. Often you can
restruture your code to "has-a" instead of "is-a" style. Make
sphBoxSource subclass vtkCubeSource and have  a member variable of
type SPHParticleProps. For which ever methods from SPHParticleProps
you want to expose, add those as methods on sphBoxSource and then
forward those calls explictly to the SPHParticleProps instance.

I'd suggest asking the question on OpenFoam mailing lists/forums. They
must have some mechanism to build with Python enabled.

But how can I set the default, especially for a new source?

Hm, that is a lot of extra work, especially because the base class
sphParticleProps
has a similar role not only for a box source, but also for sphere, cone,
cylinder, etc.
But one has to live with the given limitations of the tool.

Anyway, thanks.

Subject: [Paraview] default representation?
Message-ID: <D052F75D.1CBED%kmorel@sandia.gov>

As far as I know (and anyone else on the list is welcome to correct me),
you cannot directly change the default representation for the output of a
source/filter. The default representation is automatically chosen based on
the type of the data and the view it is being shown in.


What kind of data is the output from your source?

I found notes to myself, that I wrote when I was testing this new feature, from  last July.  However, we do need this documented, since there are many, many settings that a user can create defaults for.

Here are my notes:

- Install ParaView in some directory $INSTALL
- Delete $HOME/.config/ParaView directory
- Launch paraview (local server)
- Edit -> Settings...
- Click on gear icon to enable advanced settings
- Click on Render View tab
- Enter search text "Off". See that offscreen rendering is not enabled
- Quit ParaView
- Create a file $INSTALL/share/paraview4.1/ParaView-SiteSettings.json with the content

{
   "settings" : {
      "RenderViewSettings" : {
         "UseOffscreenRenderingForScreenshots" : 1
      }
   }
}

- Launch paraview
- Edit -> Settings...
- Click on Render View tab
- Enter search text "Off". See that offscreen rendering is now enabled
- Remove search text
- Click on General tab
- Enable "Automatically convert data arrays as needed..."
- Click OK in settings dialog box
- Quit ParaView
- View file $HOME/.config/ParaView/ParaView-UserSettings.json
- It should have the contents

{
   "settings" : {
      "GeneralSettings" : {
         "AutoConvertProperties" : 1
      },
      "RenderViewSettings" : {
         "UseOffscreenRenderingForScreenshots" : 1
      }
   }
}

Note that you can also define the environment variable PV_SETTINGS_DEBUG to view the directories where the settings are being searched.

Alan,

Documentation for this is in the new ParaView Users Guide. Relevant
text adapted from the LaTeX:

====

Configuring site-wide default settings

In addition to individual custom default settings, ParaView offers a
way to specify site-wide custom default settings for a ParaView
installation. These site-wide custom defaults must be defined in a
JSON file with the same structure as the user settings file. In fact,
one way to create a site settings file is to set the custom defaults
desired in paraview, close the program, then copy the
user settings file to the site settings file. The site settings file
must be named ParaView-SiteSettings.json.

The ParaView executables will search for the site settings file in
several locations. If you installed ParaView in the directory
INSTALL, then the ParaView executables will search for the
site settings file in these directories in the specified order:

- INSTALL/share/paraview-X.Y
- INSTALL/lib
- INSTALL
- INSTALL/..

where X is ParaView's major version number and Y is
the minor version number. ParaView executables will search these
directories in the given order, reading in the first
ParaView-SiteSettings.json file it finds. The conventional
location for this kind of configuration file is in the 'share'
directory (the first directory searched), so we recommend placing the
site settings file there.

Custom defaults in the user settings file take precedence over custom
defaults in the site settings. If the same default is specified in
both the ParaView-SiteSettings.json file and
ParaView-UserSettings.json file in a user's directory, the
default specified in the ParaView-UserSettings.json file will
be used. This is true for both object property settings and
application-settings set through the Edit -> Settings menu.

To aid in debugging problems with the site settings file location, you
can define an evironment variable named PV_SETTINGS_DEBUG
to something other than an empty string. This will turn on verbose
output showing where the ParaView executables are looking for the site
settings file.

Classification: UNCLASSIFIED
Caveats: NONE

Hi Dave,

I talked to Andrew (ARL developer working on xdmf) about the file size
issue.

I am using the ParaView-v4.2.0-source.tar.gz downloaded from ParaView
download page. Can you point me to the location of your file/code for the
reader/writer you put in?

After looking at the data file generated, he mentioned by setting
setReleaseData to true on the writer could fix the issue.

writer->getHeavyDataWriter()->setReleaseData(true);

Please see below on his comment on the matter. I have also included Andrew
in this email. If you can point me to your reader/writer code file, maybe I
can see if I can add that option to change the writer default settings.


Thanks
-simon





Classification: UNCLASSIFIED
Caveats: NONE

Here's a detailed look at the problem.

The generated Xdmf file has 31 timesteps listed in this format:

<Grid Name="Grid">
  <Time Value="0"/>
  <Geometry Type="XYZ">
    <DataItem DataType="Float" Dimensions="82724 3" Format="HDF"
Precision="4">mvf1.h5:Data7688</DataItem>
  </Geometry>
  <Topology Dimensions="49092" Type="Mixed">
    <DataItem DataType="Int" Dimensions="256032" Format="HDF"
Precision="8">mvf1.h5:Data7689</DataItem>
  </Topology>
  <Attribute Center="Node" Name="Part Index" Type="None">
    <DataItem DataType="Int" Dimensions="82724" Format="HDF"
Precision="4">mvf1.h5:Data7690</DataItem>
  </Attribute>
  <Attribute Center="Node" Name="vtkOriginalPointIds" Type="None">
    <DataItem DataType="Int" Dimensions="82724" Format="HDF"
Precision="8">mvf1.h5:Data7691</DataItem>
  </Attribute>
  <Attribute Center="Cell" Name="Material volume fraction - 1" Type="None">
    <DataItem DataType="UChar" Dimensions="49092" Format="HDF"
Precision="1">mvf1.h5:Data7692</DataItem>
  </Attribute>
  <Attribute Center="Cell" Name="vtkOriginalCellIds" Type="None">
    <DataItem DataType="Int" Dimensions="49092" Format="HDF"
Precision="8">mvf1.h5:Data7693</DataItem>
  </Attribute>
  <Attribute Center="Cell" Name="cellNormals" Type="None">
    <DataItem DataType="Float" Dimensions="49092 3" Format="HDF"
Precision="4">mvf1.h5:Data7694</DataItem>
  </Attribute>
  <Attribute Center="Cell" Name="vtkCompositeIndex" Type="None">
    <DataItem DataType="UInt" Dimensions="49092" Format="HDF"
Precision="4">mvf1.h5:Data7695</DataItem>
  </Attribute>
</Grid>

What I noticed is that the hdf5 data sets written start on dataset number
7688. Which means that there are 7687 datasets in the hdf5
file prior to the creation of the xmf file. All of these unreferenced sets
are contributing to a large hdf5 file.

I suspect that this issue may be due to the way that the writer is parsing
out the xdmf data. I presume that it is writing all data
to hdf5 each time an array is encountered, and it does make sense to do this
to save on memory.

The problem is it seems that ALL arrays are getting written to hdf5 each
time. This is probably because the XdmfHDF5Writer is on its
default settings.

The following call should help.

writer->getHeavyDataWriter()->setReleaseData(true);

This sets the writer to release the data currently contained within the
array from memory. If the XdmfWriter sees an array that has
heavy data in it, it assumes that the data has changed since the last write
and creates a new hdf5 dataset. Setting this flag causes
the heavy data writer to clear the xdmf array of data so that it will not be
written to file on a new pass.

I briefly looked at that a couple of weeks ago. Sorry I didn't get back to
you before now. 

My findings were:
1) xdm3writer performs the same as xdmf2writer 
2) I didn't find a compression option.

So, in other words, I don't have a quick fix and someone needs to put some
development time in to improve it.
The good news is that there is lots of room for improvement and it shouldn't
be too hard to do better on the writer end. It is very likely that the ARL
guys will have ideas of on ways to compress within libxdmf.

	I had similar config problems in the DoD HPC machines I tested on.
The root cause was that the system boost was CMakefied and find boost didn't
like it but insisted on using it.
	
	
	To get around it I downloaded my own boost (no need to compile it)
and made the my PV build use it by:
	In cmakecache.txt  
	set Boost_NO_SYSTEM_PATHS:BOOL=ON
	set Boost_NO_BOOST_CMAKE:BOOL=ON
	
	Then it will ask for an respect your choice of boost headers to use.

		Looks to be a CMake-ified boost. It worked here on Fedora
with 1.54.0
		(which I don't believe is built using CMake anymore). It
seems that it
		doesn't support multiple find_package calls. Try setting
		Boost_NO_BOOST_CMAKE to ON to force the FindBoost.cmake
logic to kick
		in.

Yes, vtkCamera does often update its itself. Look at vtkCamera.cxx [1].

Subject: [Paraview] default representation?

It is just a box, sphere, etc (originating from vtkCubeSource,
vtpSPhereSource).
I want to display them initially in a wireframe representation.

*Good. Thank you. And please tell me where the class for the method to
"application.exit"? And at what point is the creation of a compound?*

When you connect multiple clients, very often produces the message:

*Go to page http://SERVER_IP/apps/Visualizer
<http://SERVER_IP/apps/Visualizer>. Displays your inscription ParaViewWeb.
Spinning wheel. And then the following message appears: "Session did not
start before timeout expired. Check session logs." And when such a couple
of users are connected. Helps to restart. But 3-5 sessions and the
application starts to behave inadequately.*

Subject: [Paraview] Intersection a source with a grid?
Message-ID: <542E7E86.4090006@xs4all.nl>

I need to fill the interior of a CubeSource, a SphereSource etc. with
points that lie on a (HCP) grid.
The lattice constant of the grid is a parameter.
Can this be done in ParaView? Any hint to the solution is appreciated.

Kind Regards,
Bertwim

Bertwim,

Ken is right, the default representation is chosen by the view in
which the source output is displayed. See, for instance,

ParaView/ParaViewCore/ServerManager/Rendering/vtkSMRenderViewProxy::GetRepresentationType()

for the logic used to pick the default representation used in the 3D View.

Here are a few points to note:

There are two parts to choosing the default representation:

(a) Picking the representation proxy to use
(b) Picking which "Representation" type (e.g. Surface/Wireframe etc.)
to use -- this currently is only relevant for representations in
Render Views (or similar).

(a) happens with code pointed to by Cory
(vtkSMRenderViewProxy::GetRepresentationType). For representations in
"Render View", (b) happens in
vtkSMRepresentationTypeDomain::SetDefaultValues().
To display everything as "Wireframe", you're looking at changing (b),
more so than (a).

Pressing F5 causes your page to reload, which triggers the event handlers I
mentioned yesterday.  If you don't want to close session when reloading
page, you have to change the "stop" functionality set up in the index.html

Cory, Ken , All,

Thanks for looking into this. Maybe resetting the default was a bit too
ambitious. It is a bit annoying, though, that I cannot
display the 'my own source" the first time right.

regards,
Bertwim

Subject: [Paraview] calculator tensor field
Message-ID: <20141004101450.qdbds4v1688sswcs@wwwmail.urz.uni-heidelberg.de>

Hello everyone,

I have three displacement field vector components u, v, w in my .vtk file
and wish to display the associated stress tensor.
I made the following steps:

- Apply the filter Gradient Of Unstructued DataSet
-> Now have 9 scalars Gradient_0, ... , Gradient 8

- compute components of stress tensor via sigma_ij = div(Gradient) + u_i,j
-> Now have additional 9 scalars sigma_ij

- from this form traction vectors:
T_i = sigma_ij e_j   ,where e_j are the unit vectors iHat

-> Now have three traction vectors from which the tensor field  
computation doesnt work:

- I do Result = T_1*iHat + T_2*jHat + T_3*kHat for the tensor  
calculation and get the following error message:

ERROR: In

- Can you help me or tell me gow to visualize the stress tensor from  
the displacement field?
- Alternatively you it would also be good to know how to multiply the  
result of  filter Gradient of Unstructured DataSet by a scalar value.


Many thanks for helping!

Subject: [Paraview] new Source plugin: no show!
Message-ID: <5430129D.3020508@xs4all.nl>

Hello,

I need to write a new Source, representing a 'TriPrism",
i.e. a prism where the top and bottom planes are triangles. So far, I
failed.

Being unable to find appropriate documentation, I used the source code
of vtkCubeSource as an example, thinking it would be an easy change.
Wrong! The prism doesn't show on the screen. The
properties panel behaves as expected (and ok, as far I can see).

The member function 'RequestData' seems to be the important method.
But the code of the example (as well as other source examples) is on
closer inspection not clear to me at all.

The following is happening in the vtkCubeSource:

a)   The point of the cube are generated.  This is straightforward and
easily
        translates to the triprism.
       The new points are updated via a call "output->setPoints(
newPoints );"

b)   The normals (to the side planes of the cube) are being calculated.
       The new normals are updated via a call
       "output->GetPointData()->SetNormals(newNormals);"
        This is also straightforward for the triprism, but:

       Q: although calculating the normals is straightforward,
            in which order are they supposed to be given?

c)     Also, texture coordinates (TCoords) are calculated.
         Q: What are these?  Are these mandatory?

d)     Also, a new vtkCellArray is being created. ('newPolys')
          Q: Same question. No clue what I should do here.

As usual, any clue of how to attack this is greatly appreciated.

I assume in your request data you are generating a vtkPolyData dataset. 
At the end of request data call "dataset->Print(cerr);" . That's the one 
of the best debug method when you don't see what you think you should in 
PV while developing a new filter/source/reader what ever. The 
information tab in the GUI gives a subset of that, also useful.

texture coordinates are usually for applying an image to the surface. 
google it and you'll find volumes of info. In pv they are optional.

the cell array I'm afraid is not. when generating poly or unstructured 
data. If you have no cells what do you expect to see?

normals are per point.

some of your questions suggest that the book VTK user guide 
<http://www.kitware.com/products/books/vtkguide.html> would be a good 
investment for you.

Hope I didn't miss anything. ;-)

Hi Burlen,

Thanks for your reply. On the cell-info:  I now (finally) understood
what was there to be. After implementing the cells, I indeed got the
expected display. On the book: what keeps me from buying is that it
seems outdated (because it refers to version 3).
The texture coordinates I had found on Google indeed. What I needed was
how to apply it in Paraview/VTK. I will look into that again Maybe it
becomes clear now.

Thanks
Bertwim

Hi Bertwim,

I should have explained the cells better. The cells are descriptions of 
how points are combined into geometric primitives that can be rendered 
by OpenGL (or converted into those understood by OpenGL). Here is an 
excerpt <http://www.vtk.org/VTK/img/file-formats.pdf> of the User Guide 
describing VTK's cells, see p9-10.

Hi Burlen,

Thanks for pointing me to the User guide. Very useful.
Im rather new to Paraview/vtk, and I find it it hard to find precise
information how to get started *as a developer*. There is plenty of
material giving a more or less high level description, or it assumes
that all kind of knowlegde is already there ...). I'm not complaining
though, just need the time and the right references.

Thanks for your help.

My understanding from the "Figure 3-11 Camera attributes"
of `The Visualization Toolkit (4th ed.)' is that the view-up
vector always points upward to the camera and should always
be normal to the direction of projection (and therefore
parallel to the SCREEN).  Is this correct?  Do I misunderstand
something?

Kazuyoshi,

I just noticed that you're getting a "SliceView". I am not entirely
sure why. Is there something different with your configuration? Here's
what I get:

>>> from paraview.simple import *
paraview version 4.2.0-4-g03d4c39
>>> Box()
<paraview.servermanager.Box object at 0x7f7d6f165e10>
>>> Show()
<paraview.servermanager.GeometryRepresentation object at 0x7f7d6f133f50>
>>> Render()
<paraview.servermanager.RenderView object at 0x7f7d6f165e10>

With SliceView, the camera is managed by the SliceVIew itself. To be
able to freely play with the camera, you want the RenderView, which is
indeed the default.
Did you manually create the SliceView before running the script?

Utkarsh

Subject: [Paraview] Bug Report: Image Data are not pickable
Message-ID: <CAPvQHSBc6y+o9YOsmdaqVRKzOZbySYh3JKBuPJf8wL8pMmQ=+g@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am developing a tool based on Paraview and I found this incorrect
functionality:

Image Data (I tested with Wavelet Source) is not pickable when it is
displayed with slice, volume or outline representation, even if the
pickable checkbox is checked.
In my test I opened a render view and visualized a polydata (box) and an
image data (wavelet) source, if I click on the box it is selected, but if I
click on the wavelet in slice, volume and outlie representation it is not.

Even if it it less problematic, the same behaviour happens for Text source
as it has been reported in this bug
http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=12177

Should I open a bug report on Matis?

Thanks

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview-Python Looping over multiple state files
Message-ID: <1412619294991.49495@ufl.edu>

Hello,


This is my first time using the Paraview listserv.


I am working on a python script to automate the production of images(for purposes to making short videos from a data set).  I am using Paraview version 4.1.0-64bit.  My data is in an Ensight Gold format, which Paraview seems to read in just fine.


Here is my thought process:

1.) Open a file that has a list of state file names and store the list of state files. (rflu_states.inp)

2.) Load my Ensight data using the Paraview EnsightReader()

3.) Load a state file.

(http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Python_Scripting#Loading_State_and_Manipulating_It)<http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Python_Scripting#Loading_State_and_Manipulating_It>

4.) Loop over all times in the data and export an image for each time step in the data from Step 2.

5.) Close the state file and delete any data that may cause a memory leak(Basically to reset paraview for the next state file to be read in)

6.) Return to Step 3.


Issues that I am having:

1.) I can't seem to delete all of the data from each state file once I am done using it. (I see the memory usage keep creeping up when each state file loads)

2.) When I run the script I notice that Paraview keeps opening up new layout windows, but I never explicitly tell it to do that.

Does anyone have any experience with using Paraview like this?

I have been using the Paraview User's Manual, the Paraview Wiki, and the Paraview Trace feature to make my script.


Here is an old post from someone with a similar issue as me, but I don't think their problem ever got resolved:

http://public.kitware.com/pipermail/paraview/2012-November/026756.html

Here is my script so far:


#import os options
import os
import errno

#Load Paraview Python libraries
#from paraview.simple import *

#Image Extension
extension = '.png'

#Max Image Number Indicator
ImNum='000' # for padding image numbers with 0s

#Filename where state files are to be read from
fname = "rflu_states.inp"


#Count the number of lines in the rflu_states.inp file(gives the number of states to load)
num_lines = sum(1 for line in open(fname))

#Error Check: Print the number of lines that were read from file
print("\nNumber of lines read from input file, %s , is: %d " %(fname,num_lines) )

#Store list of state files to be loaded
with open(fname) as f:
    state_names = f.read().splitlines()

#Strip newline characters from the end of each line
state_names = [x.strip('\n') for x in state_names]


#Error Check: Print stored state names to screen
print("\nFollowing state files will be processed: " )
for x in range(0,num_lines):
        print("%s" %(state_names[x]) )

print("\n")


#Loop over all state files in rflu_states.inp
for bigLoop in range(0,num_lines):

   #Print state number and state name
   print( "Loading State %d: %s" %(bigLoop+1,state_names[bigLoop]) )

   #Call Paraview Ensight Data Reader on case file in current directory
   reader = EnSightReader(CaseFileName='cylds.case.00001')

   #Get all timesteps that are in data file
   timesteps = reader.TimestepValues

   #Load the State
   servermanager.LoadState(state_names[bigLoop])

   #Store directory name from state file name
   dirname = state_names[bigLoop] #Store loop state name
   start = dirname.find('_') + 1 #Find location of first _
   end = dirname.find('.',start) #Find location of . after first _
   dirname = dirname[start:end] #Take region between _ and .

   #Error Check: Display directory name that will be created
   print("Images for State, %s, are output to directory: %s" %(state_names[bigLoop],dirname))

   #Check if output directory exists. Create one if it does not
   try:
       os.makedirs(dirname)
   except OSError:
       if os.path.isdir(dirname):
           # We are nearly safe
           pass
       else:
           # There was an error on creation, so make sure we know about it
           raise

   #Loop over all time steps and output images
   for TimeStepNum in range(0,len(timesteps)):

      #Determine padding zeros for image
      if TimeStepNum+1 > 999:
         zero_pad = ''
      elif TimeStepNum+1 > 99:
         zero_pad = ImNum[:1]
      elif TimeStepNum+1 > 9:
         zero_pad = ImNum[:2]
      else:
         zero_pad = ImNum

      #Store active view
      view = GetActiveView()

      view.ViewTime = timesteps[TimeStepNum]

      #Render current view
      Render()


      #Adjust image name be of the of the form <name>_<number>.extension(png, jpg, etc)
      ImageName = dirname + '_' + zero_pad + str(TimeStepNum+1) + extension

      print("Printing Image %d of %d " %(TimeStepNum+1,len(timesteps)) )

      #Append directory path to image name to prepare for output
      outputDir = dirname + '/' +ImageName

      #Write image of current view to file
      WriteImage(outputDir)

   #Delete all sources(To clean up memory)
   for f in GetSources().values():
      Delete(f)

   #Delete the reader data(To clean up memory)
   Delete(reader)
   del(reader)

Can you attach a sample data file/state file? That'll make it easier
to identify the problem and suggest a solution.

Yes, for a reason, I set SliceView as my default view.

Therefore, though I'm not sure, as I remember, what I did were...
1. "Edit -> Reset Session",
2. Close "SliceView1" view,
3. Create View "Render View",
4. Open "Tools -> Python Shell", then
5. Create a Box(), then Show() and Render(),
   change the camera position, and see what the view-up is...

This time I did the same procedure again (to see if the above 
really happens in the Render view) and get almost the same result.
1. Run ParaView 4.2.0 32-bit on linux (fedora-20),
2. Close "SliceView1" view,
3. Create View "Render View",
4. Open "Tools -> Python Shell",
5. type and get the following:
Python 2.7.5 (default, Sep 25 2014, 13:58:10) 
[GCC 4.8.3 20140911 (Red Hat 4.8.3-7)] on linux2
>>> from paraview.simple import *
paraview version 4.2.0
>>> Box()
<paraview.servermanager.Box object at 0xbaf586c>
>>> Show()
<paraview.servermanager.GeometryRepresentation object at 0xbafe2cc>
>>> Render()
<paraview.servermanager.RenderView object at 0xba8e48c>
>>> cam=GetActiveCamera()
>>> cam.GetViewUp()
(0.0, 1.0, 0.0)
>>> cam.SetPosition(0,3,3)
>>> Render()
<paraview.servermanager.RenderView object at 0xbaf586c>
>>> cam.GetViewUp()
(0.0, 1.0, 0.0)
>>> 

So, it seems the view-up is not updated...


I just want to write a Python macro to change/rotate the camera
position using Azimuth() and Elevation().

In addition to the following:

> I'm observing a curious behavior of paraview.simple.Azimuth();
> camera is NOT moving left/right.

I sometimes get the following message

 Warning: In /home/furutaka/work/ParaView/ParaView.git/VTK/Rendering/Core/vtkRenderer.cxx, line 1030
vtkOpenGLRenderer (0xa702510): Resetting view-up since view plane normal is parallel

and am wondering how can the view-up be parallel to the view-plane
normal...

My understanding is that the view-up is (always) perpendicular to
the direction of projection (pointing upward of the computer display)
and therefore parallel to the view-plane, so the view-up should always
be normal to view-plane normal.
Isn't the view-plane normal parallel to the direction of projection?
Isn't the view-plane parallel to the front/back clipping planes?

Could someone tell me whether the meanings of the azimuth and
the elevation in ParaView the same as those in VTK (or "The
Visualization Toolkit" book, 4th ed.) or not?

In the book it reads:
"Changing the \textit{azimuth} of a camera rotates its position
around its view up vector, centered at the focal point.  Think
of this as moving the cmaera to the left or right while always
keeping the distance to the focal point constant.  Changing a 
camera's \textit{elevation} rotates its position around the cross
product of its direction of projection and view up centered at the
focal point.  This corresponds to moving the camera up and down.
To \textit{roll} the camera, we rotate the view up vector about
the view plane normal.  Roll is sometimes called twist."

I sometimes observe that (in the Multi Slice view,) Azimuth()
"rolls" instead of moving the camera left/right.

That's why I want to understand the geometry of view-up, direction
of projection, and so on...

The meaning of azimuth, elevation etc. is indeed same with VTK and
ParaVIew. ParaView uses the same code for Camera as in VTK, so there's
no different there. Here's some explanation on the inner workings of
the camera:

+ The camera->ViewUp is used by vtkCamera as a "hint" for the up
direction. Thus, it is need not always be orthogonal to the view
direction (defined by camera position and camera focal point). Unless
the ViewUp is parallel to the view -direction, the vtkCamera will
automatically compute the true "viewup" internally using
vtkCamera::ViewUp as a hint.
+ You can use cam.OrthogonalizeViewUp() to force the vtkCamera to
update the VIewUp based on the internally used ViewUp.

e.g.

>>> cam = GetActiveCamera()
>>> cam.SetPosition(0, 3, 3)
>>> Render()
>>> cam.GetViewUp()
(0.0, 1.0, 0.0)
>>> cam.OrthogonalizeViewUp()
>>> cam.GetViewUp()
(0.0, 0.7071067811865476, -0.7071067811865476)

I am not sure I observe the same problem as you mention with Azimuth/Roll.

Dear Utkarsh,

Thanks for the great hint!
By forcing the update of view-up using cam.OrthogonalizeViewUp()
on initialization as well as on changing azimuthal angle etc.,
I can successfully change azimuth angle instead of rolling.

Thanks again.

Subject: [Paraview] Exporting a selection
Message-ID: <CALyWQMJtKKjFT2KRG5uL5tv9ZVhO9sg3rvRhB9298MKu2toGjw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I would like to be able to look at a particular part of my output and plot
the maximum value of some fields over time. This needs to be done in a
script since the process needs to be applied to several different runs.

I tried to use the trace to get the list of point IDs in the region of
interest, but the result of doing select point on followed by extract
selection is this


# create a new 'Extract Selection'

extractSelection1 = ExtractSelection(Input=pK10HOJ_0001000,

    Selection=None)


so it is not giving me the ID's. To get the plot maximum over time I
am using find data to select all points and then using plot selection
over time. However, again the trace does not tell me what the
selection should be



# create a new 'Plot Selection Over Time'

plotSelectionOverTime1 = PlotSelectionOverTime(Input=pK10HOJ_0001000,

    Selection=None)

plotSelectionOverTime1.OnlyReportSelectionStatistics = 0


Is there any way to get this info? Or perhaps an alternate way to go
about plotting max over time in a specified region?


Thanks and all the best,

Colin

Message-ID: <201410071325.s97DPBsq004082@msw1.awe.co.uk>


Hello everyone,

I am trying to build a file reader plugin against ParaView 4.2.0 and have been experiencing some difficulties. Qt is not found by cmake during the build process causing it to fail.

To illustrate the issue, I created the following simplified CMakeLists.txt file:

    CMAKE_MINIMUM_REQUIRED
    FIND_PACKAGE(ParaView REQUIRED)
    INCLUDE(${PARAVIEW_USE_FILE})

When I call cmake with ParaView_DIR pointing at my 4.1.0 build Qt is found, but with 4.2.0 Qt is NOT found.

ParaView was built using Superbuild and Qt was built as part of that process. Should Qt be detected from ParaViewConfig.cmake?

Is this a change in behaviour between 4.1.0 and 4.2.0? Do I somehow need to specify the location of Qt manually?

Any ideas?

Thank you,
Jim

Gianna,

For Calculator filter,  names with "_X", "_Y" have special meaning.
Try change Calulators 1-9 to use Result Array names as "sigmaXX",
"sigmaYY", etc.
Does that work?

Hi, 
I have scientific data from a microscope with 2 channels. I have to merge
these two channels, but unfortunately there is only one color map. So both
channels ( Reprensentation: "Volume") are expressed in one color. I need two
color maps,so that the channels have different colors . My ParaView Version
is 4.2.0. 

Is anyone able to help me with detailed steps?

Thanks

Jim,

I had similar issues you describe. They were gone when I made sure that,
before actually calling cmake,  the right 'qmake' was in the PATH  (i.e.
'which qmake'  points to the qmake of the AQT-version your expect). 
This assumes that you do have a Qt installation which is complete.
In other words:
1. ensure qmake of the Qt distribution you expect is in your path
2. ensure your paraview build directory is clean ( rm -rf   <path>/build/* )
3. start the cmake configuration.

Hope this works for you too,

Regards,
Bertwim

Hi,

I'm working on a legacy ParaView 3.14.1 plugin project. On Windows, I can't seem to figure out the settings so that the plugin .dlls will work on any machine other than the dev machine.

The errors I get are along the lines of:

***************************************************
Attempting to load C:\Program Files\ParaView 3.14.1\bin\plugins\RVA_Core_Plugin.dll
ERROR: In ..\..\..\..\src\ParaViewCore\ClientServerCore\vtkPVPluginLoader.cxx, line 296
vtkPVPluginLoader (000000000B21CBC0): The specified procedure could not be found.
I take this to mean that some other library can't be found.

I'm not doing a Superbuild, because I don't want to redistribute an entire ParaView, just the the plugin. Should I be using the Superbuild anyway?

Mark

Dear Utkarsh,

I changed the Result Array names to sigmaXX etc but still get the same  
error message.
I think the problem is with the product between the two unit vectors.
Simply calculating for example " iHat*iHat " yields the same error message.

Would you know in general how to form a tensor field in paraview from  
its components?

Thanks,
Gianna

This may be easier to do in the Python Calculator, which is more efficient
anyway. For accessing a specific component of a vector you can do something
like "Normals[:,0]". For a 2nd order tensor you'd do something like
"StrainRate[:,0,1]".

Subject: [Paraview] Bug in Paraview 4.2 example + fix
Message-ID: <54344D72.8080407@xs4all.nl>

Hello,

I think there is a bug in the plugin example in 
../ParaView/Examples/Plugin/Representation (Paraview 4.2)

As given, loading the plugin manually, and then creating a new source
(e.g. Box) causes Paraview to crash with the error message:

> ERROR: In
> /usr/local/git/ParaView/ParaViewCore/ServerImplementation/Core/vtkSIProxyDefinitionManager.cxx,
> line 565
> vtkSIProxyDefinitionManager (0x265ebb0): No proxy that matches:
> group=representations and proxy=SurfaceRepresentationBase were found.

> ERROR: In

> line 989
> vtkSIProxyDefinitionManager (0x265ebb0): Failed to locate base proxy
> definition (representations, SurfaceRepresentationBase). Aborting for
> debugging purposes.
>
>
> Abort

The error seems to be in the file Representation.xml, where the attribute
base_proxyname is set to "SurfaceRepresentationBase", which should be
"SurfaceRepresentation" according to the documentation in
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Plugin_HowTo#Adding_new_Representations_for_3D_View_using_Plugins_.2A_new_in_version_3.7

When I make the change, recompile the plugin and load in into Paraview,
there is no longer the above crash when I create a new Box, and the
representation "Special Mapper" feautures in the Representationnn combobox.

Gianna,

If I understand correctly, you are trying to multiply a row vector [a,
b, c] by a column vector [d, e, f]^T (where ^T indicates transpose) to
get a matrix. Actually, you are doing this three times and then
summing the resulting matrices to get a tensor matrix. Is that
correct?

If that its the case, I do not believe it is possible to produce a
matrix output. Like Andy, I suggest using the Python Calculator.
Documentation is available here:

http://www.itk.org/Wiki/ParaView/Users_Guide/Python_Calculator

Hope that helps,
Cory

Follow up question, since the ParaView 3.14.1 pre-built 64 bit binaries come with msvcr90.dll, msvcp90.dll, etc. which is from VS 2005, does that mean VS 2005 is the newest Visual Studio I can use to build redistributable plugins for ParaView 3.14.1?

Hi,

I'm working on a legacy ParaView 3.14.1 plugin project. On Windows, I can't seem to figure out the settings so that the plugin .dlls will work on any machine other than the dev machine.

The errors I get are along the lines of:

***************************************************
Attempting to load C:\Program Files\ParaView 3.14.1\bin\plugins\RVA_Core_Plugin.dll
ERROR: In ..\..\..\..\src\ParaViewCore\ClientServerCore\vtkPVPluginLoader.cxx, line 296
vtkPVPluginLoader (000000000B21CBC0): The specified procedure could not be found.
I take this to mean that some other library can't be found.

I'm not doing a Superbuild, because I don't want to redistribute an entire ParaView, just the the plugin. Should I be using the Superbuild anyway?

Mark

Mark,

If you intend your plugin to be loadable with the distributed binaries
for 3.14, you must indeed use the same compiler as listed here[1] for
the appropriate version and OS. For 3.14, that's VS2008.

Hi Bertwim,

This worked for me - cmake now finds Qt and builds the plugin. Many thanks.

It isn't clear to me why it previously worked with PV 4.1.0 but not with 4.2.0. I guess it doesn't matter as long as it's working :)

Kind regards,
Jim

Jim,

I had similar issues you describe. They were gone when I made sure that, before actually calling cmake,  the right 'qmake' was in the PATH  (i.e. 'which qmake'  points to the qmake of the AQT-version your expect).  This assumes that you do have a Qt installation which is complete.
In other words:
1. ensure qmake of the Qt distribution you expect is in your path
2. ensure your paraview build directory is clean ( rm -rf   <path>/build/* )
3. start the cmake configuration.

Hope this works for you too,

Regards,
Bertwim

Hello everyone,

I am trying to build a file reader plugin against ParaView 4.2.0 and have been experiencing some difficulties. Qt is not found by cmake during the build process causing it to fail.

To illustrate the issue, I created the following simplified CMakeLists.txt file:

    CMAKE_MINIMUM_REQUIRED
    FIND_PACKAGE(ParaView REQUIRED)
    INCLUDE(${PARAVIEW_USE_FILE})

When I call cmake with ParaView_DIR pointing at my 4.1.0 build Qt is found, but with 4.2.0 Qt is NOT found.

ParaView was built using Superbuild and Qt was built as part of that process. Should Qt be detected from ParaViewConfig.cmake?

Is this a change in behaviour between 4.1.0 and 4.2.0? Do I somehow need to specify the location of Qt manually?

Any ideas?

Thank you,
Jim

Subject: [Paraview] Newbie question: How to search the archive? Working with
	'point data'
Message-ID: <CAPbGgMz3k0Ze+ae=1YgiOr0WKODvKU51y5kDsyWRT_H4dtaB5g@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings --

I'm new to the list, and working through the Paraview Tutorial a 2nd time
(amazing how much can be forgotten with a 1 year lapse).

This time around, I'm specifically interested in working with point data,
for which I have 3D positions and velocities in white-space delimited text
(ascii) files.

I'd like to search the archives for discussions related to handling this
type of data, but there are no obvious search capabilities at the
public.kitware.com/ archive-related pages that I've found -- just
instructions to register for the mailing list.

Help with any of the above will be appreciated!
Cheers,
~ E.m.

Hey E.M.,

First thing I recommend is to read the data in with the delimited text
reader, then apply table to points.
Attached is a state file to demonstrate.

Eventually you may want to move to a more efficient (e.g. binary) format
for performance and scalability but this will get you started.

My preferred way to search the list archives is markmail.org.

Subject: [Paraview] exporting .vtk files to Matlab
Message-ID: <F950698782A6244C90281D4FF9C7C10C0218C50621ED@UM-MAIL4114.unimaas.nl>

Hi Paraview community,

I want to export a .vtk file to Matlab. To do so, I read some time ago that I could save the .vtk file as a .csv and read it easily in Matlab. Thus, that's what I tried. When I open the .csv file in Matlab, I get the position of the vertices but not the intensities associated to them. That information is basically missing. I also tried to read the .vtk file in Matlab by a customized function, and again, the information related to the intensities is missing. So I was wondering if there is a way to keep those intensity values. 

Thanks in advance!

Cheers,

Amaia.

Subject: [Paraview] Animating over MultiBlock data set
Message-ID: <B3DA3089-0CD5-4375-891A-C46B720221FC@bluequartz.net>

I am writing an Xdmf file with 75 "Grids" where each grid represents a time step from a simulation. When I read it into ParaView it shows 75 Blocks. I can load each one at a time and I get the expected output. What is the magic to animating over a multi-block data set. Each block has the same exact set of Data arrays.

Ideas?

Do I understand it correctly that you have always a uniform geometry, 
just the data changes in time?

Are you using something like this:
<Grid CollectionType="Temporal" GridType="Collection" Name="FieldData">

Well, I attached a small xdmf file that shows how to animate in time 
(assuming a constant geometry). Hope it is of help.

The Topology stays the same for every time step (There are Vertex Points). The actual position of the points move in time (The Geometry changes).

Message-ID: <CADgo70xeGE6w__UJmYb=YVKsQrW0ouV9Vw_i09dkWuRGseB7Pw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,


I am running paraview 4.2.0 under ubuntu 14 and trying to generate a ogv
video but appeared this error.


ERROR: In
/home/kitware/Dashboards/MyTests/NightlyMaster/ParaViewSuperbuild-Release/paraview/src/paraview/ParaViewCore/Animation/vtkSMAnimationSceneImageWriter.cxx,
line 385

pqAnimationSceneImageWriter (0x89c4ab0): Unknown extension .ogv


I returned to 4.1.0 version and worked.


Could anyone suggest solution to 4.2.0?


Best regards,


David

In that case you have to at least put the Geometry section inside the 
temporal grid.

I attached a xdmf file that shows how it should look then (the file 
works for changing Geometry and Topology).

If you can post the relevant part of your xdmf file, it would probably 
be easier see what is going wrong.

Thanks for the help. I was able to get an animation to work. Now I just need to clean up some of my own code that writes the .xdmf file.

Subject: [Paraview] displaying simulation time rather than time step
Message-ID: <5435abd6.0576320a.7a74.1035@mx.google.com>

I would like to do something similar to the Annotate Time filter, but rather
than displaying the time step number, I need to display simulation date and
time.

 

I have a text file with the actual simulation date and time associated with
each time step.  Here are the first few lines of that file

 

Time step   Time step output, Actual time

0               0.00,           4/1/2013 15:00

1               65.83,          4/1/2013 15:01

2               125.88,         4/1/2013 15:02

3               201.00,         4/1/2013 15:03

4               268.65,         4/1/2013 15:04

5               328.83,         4/1/2013 15:05

6               366.46,         4/1/2013 15:06

 

.

 

So, rather than Time: 0 at the bottom of the 3D window, I'd like to have
4/1/2013 15:00

 

Any thoughts / recommendations on how to accomplish this task will be
greatly appreciated.

 

Thanks,

Phil

Hey Phil,
You *might* be able to hack it with a combination of a Programmable Filter and a Python Annotation Filter.  Use the Programmable Filter to add a FieldData value to each time step that is a string with the appropriate date.  Then use the Python Annotation Filter to display the date as an annotation.

The first part is the hard one.  The Programmable Filter could either (1) read the file once to get all the dates, or (2) compute the dates using the starting date, the time step value, and Python's datetime module.

Thanks,
Sean

Hi Sean,

 

Can we talk?  I'm not smart enough to understand your suggestion (hate it
when that happens).  

 

If I get something worked out, even a hack, I'll post the solution back to
this list.

 

Thanks!

Phil

I think that Sean is on the right track and suggest that a Python Animation
cue is the way to go.

Attached is a state file to demonstrate. Load the state file in ParaView,
open Views->Animation View and double click on the existing Python track to
see the script that gets the pipeline time and feeds it into a text source
for display. I've left the parts about reading the file and mapping the
Animation time into the corresponding simulation time as an exercise to the
reader.

Note: many time varying file formats produce the data time for you so this
translation is unnecessary and the Annotate Time filter will do what you
want it to.

Strike that last comment about Annotate Time doing the right thing. There
are probably file formats that make the date/time string available, but I
can't name one off the top of my head and you will still need to hook up
the connection to the Text Source something like above.

I would like to know what the flags imply:

VTK_SMP_IMPLEMENTATION_TYPE: Which multi-threaded parallelism implementation to use. Options are Sequential, Simple, Kaapi or TBB.

Is there a proper description of these parameters (or a an example/test in the suite)?
The following paper yields some information: http://hal.inria.fr/docs/00/78/98/14/PDF/RR-8245.pdf

I would assume that these improvements translate to the insertion of appropriate directives, semaphores and the like in several parts of VTK. Could you point me to material/papers which would explain implementation specific details?
Some online sources (probably outdated) claim that VTK is not thread safe.

Thanks

Hi Praveen,

The paper that you linked is the original implementation and is still quite
relevant.

See: http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/images/3/3b/VTK_SMP_Guide.pdf
for more information on the work as it stands now that it has been brought
into VTK proper (as of release 6.1)

As that doc says, VTK is still largely _not_ thread safe. Portions of it
always have been. For example anything used within the threaded image
filters was before vtkSMP, and anything used within Filters/SMP is now.

Turn on the Filters/SMP module to try it and take a look at the Cxx
regression tests in the module itself for starters.

Subject: [Paraview] Point swarm with one cell
Message-ID: <543614A7.9060003@liquidmesh.com>

I have a point swarm (output from Underworld thermal model), with one 
cell, and 32768 points. I cannot seem to get any sort of visualisation 
from it after filtering. If I apply a Threshold filter to 'remove' some 
of the data, nothing shows at all.

If I first apply a Clip filter, but set it outside the range of the 
data, then the result is a dataset with 32768 cells, and 32768 points. 
The Threshold filter works after that.

Why is this?

It's because most of the filters which operate on 'cells' don't really handle the multi-vertex cell type in the way you'd like. Converting the data to 32768 cells with one point each is the solution. you used to be able to use MaskPoints filter to do that, but the singlecellpervertex function is not exposed in paraview, so the threshold is one way to do it.

Subject: [Paraview] Threshold not working for unstructured grid
Message-ID: <5436564C.8030302@lspr.ch>

Dear Paraview,

I am new to this list, so I would like to immediately apologise if my
style does not meet your standard.

I am learning to use Paraview, and I have problems using the threshold
filter. I have attached 2 .vtk files based on documentation examples to
explain my point

I use filters->common->threshold, then specify Scalars->cell_scalars
and choose range [1,3].

* For the "polydata.vtk" I observe some of the rectangles disappear as
expected. If I manipulate the range, I can get any one rectangle disappear.

* For the "unstructured.vtk" I see all but one triangle disappear, which
is unexpected. If I manipulate the range, either the tetrahedron
disappears altogether, or only one triangle is visible.

Could you please tell me what am I doing wrong?

A similar question came up a few weeks ago and I posted this link
https://hpcforge.org/plugins/scmgit/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=pv-echam/pv-echam.git;a=blob;f=vtkJulianDayToTextConvertor.h;h=490320de30539ed88527ca79c53e2acc17264bf5;hb=HEAD
To a class which takes climate simulation time stamps and converts them from julian date to a string. This can then be viewed in the paraview gui as a time stamp with an arbitrary format ? you can add the time as well as the date by some simple changes.

I have not used it myself for several years, but just copied the vtkJulianDayToTextConverter.* files and jdn.c into another plugin and tried them. Apart from one tweak because DATA/UPDATE_TIME_STEPS are now singular it compiled ok and is working as expected.

The class create a single text string in a 1x1 table and paraview displays this as an annotation.

Strike that last comment about Annotate Time doing the right thing. There are probably file formats that make the date/time string available, but I can't name one off the top of my head and you will still need to hook up the connection to the Text Source something like above.

I think that Sean is on the right track and suggest that a Python Animation cue is the way to go.

Attached is a state file to demonstrate. Load the state file in ParaView, open Views->Animation View and double click on the existing Python track to see the script that gets the pipeline time and feeds it into a text source for display. I've left the parts about reading the file and mapping the Animation time into the corresponding simulation time as an exercise to the reader.

Note: many time varying file formats produce the data time for you so this translation is unnecessary and the Annotate Time filter will do what you want it to.

Hey Phil,
You *might* be able to hack it with a combination of a Programmable Filter and a Python Annotation Filter.  Use the Programmable Filter to add a FieldData value to each time step that is a string with the appropriate date.  Then use the Python Annotation Filter to display the date as an annotation.

The first part is the hard one.  The Programmable Filter could either (1) read the file once to get all the dates, or (2) compute the dates using the starting date, the time step value, and Python's datetime module.

Thanks,

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [Paraview] displaying simulation time rather than time step

I would like to do something similar to the Annotate Time filter, but rather than displaying the time step number, I need to display simulation date and time.

I have a text file with the actual simulation date and time associated with each time step.  Here are the first few lines of that file

Time step   Time step output, Actual time
0               0.00,           4/1/2013 15:00
1               65.83,          4/1/2013 15:01
2               125.88,         4/1/2013 15:02
3               201.00,         4/1/2013 15:03
4               268.65,         4/1/2013 15:04

6               366.46,         4/1/2013 15:06

?

So, rather than Time: 0 at the bottom of the 3D window, I?d like to have 4/1/2013 15:00

Any thoughts / recommendations on how to accomplish this task will be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Phil

Hi Aleksejs,

Welcome to the ParaView mailing list.

This appears to be a bug that you've found. In case you didn't notice, for
the unstructured grid there are 4 triangle cells that connect to look like
a tet. I've added a Mantis issue at
http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=15040.

Thanks,
Andy

Thanks Utkarsh, I'm so used to only building for my own system and not distributing that I hadn't run into this before.

Mark,

If you intend your plugin to be loadable with the distributed binaries for 3.14, you must indeed use the same compiler as listed here[1] for the appropriate version and OS. For 3.14, that's VS2008.

Message-ID: <CAE=GJrbkfyUtwzzv=xpjWtirio7kbxYU4iKg=4C0rAYEOzzL5g@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I've been working with VRPN in a CAVE environment and my next goal is to do
a slice in a vtk structured grid.

I can choose the slice position pressing and moving the selected button and
wand  in the VR interaction configuration, but how can i hit the "Apply"
button and actually slice the object?

Subject: [Paraview] Python script running out of memory
Message-ID: <CACoCd8fhSZko_HEJVWF4g9+ExM2Q4f1M8Ex6pB2C_0JjY=POqg@mail.gmail.com>

Hey folks,

I have created the attached script by using the Trace feature in Paraview
(version 4.2.0-RC1-128-gc89b0ad) and then tweaked it to run on multiple
.pvtu files. I don't doubt that there is a better way to do this but this
is what I came up with.

I run the script using pvbatch. The problem is that it'll run for a while
and then run out of memory. I also get the following errors on every pass
through the script after the first pass.

ERROR: In
/home/kitware/Dashboards/MyTests/NightlyMaster/ParaViewSuperbuild-Release/paraview/src/paraview/ParaViewCore/ServerManager/Rendering/vtkSMViewLayoutProxy.cxx,
line 481
vtkSMViewLayoutProxy (0x385f370): Cell identified by location '0' is
already split. Cannot split the cell again.

ERROR: In
/home/kitware/Dashboards/MyTests/NightlyMaster/ParaViewSuperbuild-Release/paraview/src/paraview/ParaViewCore/ServerManager/Rendering/vtkSMViewLayoutProxy.cxx,
line 551
vtkSMViewLayoutProxy (0x385f370): Cell is not empty.

It seems to me that Paraview is trying to reuse the slice created in the
last pass and perhaps I need to do something to reset the data or free the
data or something like that. I tried a few things like

Delete(fileReader)
del fileReader
Delete(slice1)
del slice1

etc. at the end of each pass but nothing I tried eliminated the errors.
Incidentally, these errors seemed to be irrelevant as the images exported
just fine until the pvbatch crashed after ' throwing an instance of
'std::bad_alloc' hat():  std::bad_alloc'

Does anybody mind taking a look at this and telling me what I'm doing
wrong, or at least pointing me to documentation/examples that might help me
to figure this out. I did read through the seemingly relevant Google search
results dealing with scripting with Paraview with no luck.

I appreciate your time,

Jim,

I believe this was accidentally changed when support for Qt5 was added
in commit eed7ccd3f7e804fed3864fcbe54fbd6958e63b41.

In ParaView/CMake/UseParaView.cmake, can you try adding

set(QT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE ${PARAVIEW_QT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE})

just before the lines with

find_package(Qt4)

and see if that works? This was the line that was removed.

If that works (without qmake being in your PATH), I'll put a patch in
the repository.

Thanks,
Cory

Using David?s example and a very helpful conversation with Sean I was able to successfully use a Python track in animation and show the actual simulation time.

 

I?m not an experienced Python user (as you?ll see in the example below), but I got some simple code to work.  Below is an example of the code I ended up with in the Python animation track.  

 

  def start_cue: pass

 

  def tick(self):

    # set up the mapping from time step to date/time information

    #

    dateTimes = []

    dateTimes.append( '4/1/2013 15:00' )

    dateTimes.append( '4/1/2013 15:01' )

    dateTimes.append( '4/1/2013 15:02' )

    dateTimes.append( '4/1/2013 15:03' )

 

    maxIndex = len(dateTimes)

 

    index = int( self.GetClockTime() )

    if index >= maxIndex :

      index = maxIndex - 1

 

    textSource = paraview.simple.FindSource("TheText")

    textSource.Text = dateTimes[index]

 

  def end_cue(self): pass

 

 

Thanks!

I think that Sean is on the right track and suggest that a Python Animation cue is the way to go.

 

Attached is a state file to demonstrate. Load the state file in ParaView, open Views->Animation View and double click on the existing Python track to see the script that gets the pipeline time and feeds it into a text source for display. I've left the parts about reading the file and mapping the Animation time into the corresponding simulation time as an exercise to the reader.

 

Note: many time varying file formats produce the data time for you so this translation is unnecessary and the Annotate Time filter will do what you want it to.

Hey Phil,
You *might* be able to hack it with a combination of a Programmable Filter and a Python Annotation Filter.  Use the Programmable Filter to add a FieldData value to each time step that is a string with the appropriate date.  Then use the Python Annotation Filter to display the date as an annotation.

The first part is the hard one.  The Programmable Filter could either (1) read the file once to get all the dates, or (2) compute the dates using the starting date, the time step value, and Python's datetime module.

Thanks,
Sean

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [Paraview] displaying simulation time rather than time step

 

I would like to do something similar to the Annotate Time filter, but rather than displaying the time step number, I need to display simulation date and time.

 

I have a text file with the actual simulation date and time associated with each time step.  Here are the first few lines of that file

 

Time step   Time step output, Actual time

0               0.00,           4/1/2013 15:00

1               65.83,          4/1/2013 15:01

2               125.88,         4/1/2013 15:02

3               201.00,         4/1/2013 15:03

4               268.65,         4/1/2013 15:04

5               328.83,         4/1/2013 15:05

6               366.46,         4/1/2013 15:06

 

?

 

So, rather than Time: 0 at the bottom of the 3D window, I?d like to have 4/1/2013 15:00

 

Any thoughts / recommendations on how to accomplish this task will be greatly appreciated.

 

Thanks,

Phil

Subject: [Paraview] XMLUnstructuredGridWriter and VTK_POLYHEDRON elements
Message-ID: <BD843AD0-6223-4BEC-AD40-78DA34803982@anl.gov>

Hi,

I have a serial vtu dataset provided by one of my users.  Their current code can produce this in either ascii or inline binary.  I am currently trying to convert this to appended binary (ultimately to pvtu with appended binary).
I'm having trouble, which I now believe may stem from the data containing VTK_POLYHEDRON.

I have a simple python script that I use with pvbatch to do this conversion, but I see the same results when I load the original data set with ParaView (4.1.0, in client/server mode), and use the Save Data option and save as vtu.
I get the same results for each input format (ascii or inline binary), and output format (ascii, binary, appended).

The first few lines of the original vtu file look like this:

<?xml version="1.0"?>
  <VTKFile type="UnstructuredGrid" version="0.1" byte_order="BigEndian">
  <UnstructuredGrid>
    <Piece NumberOfPoints="1699427" NumberOfCells="384126">

The first few lines of the converted file look like this:

offset="177748206"ructuredGrid" version="0.1" byte_order="LittleEndian">
  <UnstructuredGrid>
    <Piece NumberOfPoints="1699427"              NumberOfCells="384126"              >


Something is clearly getting jumbled at the beginning of the converted file.  If I manually edit the header of the file to read  <VTKFile type="UnstructuredGrid", there are still problems with the file.  In that case the info tab in ParaView reports the correct number of points and cells, but no geometry is drawn.   I have successfully converted other vtu files using this same method.  The primary difference that I've been able to identify is that the files that are not converting happily contain VTK_POLYHEDRON elements.

Has anyone else seen similar behavior?

Thanks,
joe

Subject: [Paraview] Newbie question on python filter and integrating over a
	dimension
Message-ID: <CAKU98S+pmCMt-3dgv9ajwLuPwrQsH8m6taBKCx6SXgD5ksbN5g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I have a super newbie question, I am trying to properly learn how to
use the programmable python filter to integrate along dimensions of my
arrays.  The below seems to work, but it is extremely slow, and I'm
sure the dumbest thing I can be doing.

What I have is a scalar field in 2d called alpha_0, and a vector field
in 2d called sigma_0_0__sigma_0_1, and I want to integrate the term:

f(alpha)*g(sigma)


along a single dimension of my mesh.  In latex form, if my domain is
(x,y) \in Omega\subset R^2, then I want to compute for every x: int_y
f*g dy.  The terms f and g are defined in more detail below in the
script.

The best solution would include the one-diemsnional output graph as
well, whereas now, I just compute the values at each point and output
to print.  Any advice would be very appreciated.

Cheers,
Craig


--------------------

import numpy

alpha0 = inputs[0].PointData['alpha_0']
alpha1 = inputs[0].PointData['alpha_0']
sigma0 = inputs[0].PointData['sigma_0_0__sigma_0_1']

pdi = self.GetInputDataObject(0,0)

bg_field = 1
pdi = self.GetInputDataObject(0,0)
pdo = self.GetOutputDataObject(0)
numPoints = pdi.GetNumberOfPoints()
import time

ind=self.GetInput()
iin=ind.GetInformation()
timestep = time.clock()

dx = 100.0
dy = 100.0

# Find the dx and dy for integration on the uniform mesh (there must
be a better way?)
for (j,alpha) in enumerate(alpha0):
    x1,y1,z1 = pdi.GetPoint(j)[:3]
    x2,y2,z2 = pdi.GetPoint(j+1)[:3]
    if abs(x2-x1) <= dx and abs(x2-x1)>0:
        dx = x2 - x1
    if abs(y2-y1) <= dy and abs(y2-y1)>1e-6:
        dy = y2 - y1

counter = 0
last_step = -1.0
prev_x = 0.0
efold = numpy.zeros(numPoints)
y_first = -1.0


#integrate the term using a simple Reimann sum:
int_at_each_x_coordinate_along_y
# (1/exp(2*alpha))*sigma_x_component dy (this is very slow!)

for (j,alpha) in enumerate(alpha0):
    x,y,z = pdi.GetPoint(j)
    if x<380.0 and x>70.0 and y==0.0:
        y_first = []
        for (i,alpha_1) in enumerate(alpha1):
            x1,y1,z1 = pdi.GetPoint(i)
            if x1 == x and y1 == y:
                for (k,sigmax) in enumerate(sigma0):
                    x2,y2,z2 = pdi.GetPoint(i)
                    if x2 == x1: #and y2 == y1:
                        if y2 not in y_first:
                            efold[j] +=  ( 1.0/exp(2.0*alpha_1) ) *
sigmax[0] * dy  #exp(alpha_1)*sigmax[0]*dy
                            y_first.append(y2)

                if x!=last_step:
                    counter = counter + 1
                    print "y_integrated_chi_at1(",floor(timestep),",",
counter,") = ", efold[j]/377.0, ";"
                    print "x(",counter,") = ", x, ";"
                    last_step = x

Hi Philipp,

I looked into this more, and it turns out it isn't a bug, but a new
feature in ParaView/VTK that lets provides more flexibility in the
numeric type of the point positions. By default, most filters will set
the numeric type of the output points to the numeric type of their
inputs. In the data set you sent me, the points are set to have type
int (specified on line 7), which means that the points in the output
of the Contour filter will be cast to ints. This explains the jagged
appearance of your surfaces.

The change in VTK that brings about this behavior is:

commit f830ef4cd79b1e7c8af2fae6ed1dd02ffa2cd670
Author: Paul Edwards <Paul.Edwards3 at Rolls-Royce.com>
Date:   Thu Jan 10 10:01:47 2013 -0500

    Fixing loss of point-precision in certain filters.

    Certain filters tend to loose point precision and end up
converting double point
    arrays to flot arrays. This patch address the issue for a few
filters using the
    API added to vtkAlgorithm by commit 49d1f124.

    Change-Id: I8740e4e4bfdd9944fbadb45744038e42eff04830

Now, how to fix your problem? If you change the type of points from
int to double in your data file so that it reads

POINTS 6823544 double

instead of

POINTS 6823544 int

all should work as expected.

Please let me know if that doesn't solve the problem for you.

Best regards,
Cory

Could perhaps somebody of Kitware react to this posting of a bug?
I noticed a similar issue with the Example plugin "HiddenLinesRemoval",
although in that case there seems to be more wrong.

Hello,

We are wondering if someone can point us in the right direction to track
down the issue we are getting. We managed to get ParaView OSMESA compile on
our SGI UV  System. But in a client/server execution mode, although we are
able to connect and paraview starts up on the HPC side, as soon as we try to
draw something, we get a segmentation fault error - please see error message
at the bottom of this email.

ParaView 4.2.0 osmesa is configure with the following options. 

-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
-DParaView_FROM_GIT=ON \
-DENABLE_boost=ON \
-DENABLE_cgns=OFF \

--timeout=00:10:00 --connect-id=43826

Any suggestion on what/where we can start to track this segmentation fault
issue down is much appreciated.

Hi Bertwim,

Thanks for reporting this bug and proposing a fix.

I posted your report as a bug in the bug tracker:

http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=15044

I also pushed a git topic to gerrit with your fix and some fixes for
the HiddenLinesRemoval plugin. Please feel free to review it:

http://review.source.kitware.com/#/t/4837/

Thanks,
Cory

Hi Cory,

Thanks for putting the fix in. Though willing to contribute, I have no
experience with gerrit.  So I don't know what to do, really.

Regards,
Bertwim

Subject: [Paraview] BOX -> volume?
Message-ID: <54383746.6010105@xs4all.nl>

Can perhaps somebody point me how to address the following.

When I create a new source (say: a box) I get an a box that
can be displayed via its surfaces, its constituing points, or wireframe
representation.
But I need a volume rendering (so that I can add e.g. a clipping plane)
How do I get that?

Regards,
Bertwim

Hello,

http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Superbuild mentioned, if I want to
build a specific version, I will do

git clone git://paraview.org/ParaViewSuperbuild.git
cd ParaViewSuperbuild
git checkout v4.1.0

That has always worked for me for v4.1.0 tag

But with v4.2.0 release, if I do the following on different days,

git clone git://paraview.org/ParaViewSuperbuild.git
cd ParaViewSuperbuild
git checkout v4.2.0

I am getting v4.2.0-${SOME HASH NUMBER} that is different every time. Am I
missing something? This is causing me problem when I am trying to get the
same version of ParaView mesa and osmesa build for client/server mode. I end
up doing a 

-DParaView_URL=../paraview/ParaView-v4.2.0-source.tar.gz

To get around the problem. Thoughts?


Thanks
-simon

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView 4.2.0 client/server execution error on SGI
 UV System (UNCLASSIFIED)
In-Reply-To: <F02E4EC9F4B4BA4189BBDC8BF3B2AD82254DB3EF@umechp9h.easf.csd.disa.mil>
Message-ID: <D05E2543.6AB21%biddisco@cscs.ch>

The client has created the representation glyph3d, but the server hasn?t
got it compiled in by the looks of it, so the create representation fails.
Does it get skipped when using osmesa (and hence doesn?t exist on the
server)?

I?m not certain of this, but it happens all the time with the same error
when one of my plugins that create a representation is loaded on the
client - but not on the server.

Hi Bertwin,

No problem. It would be helpful to me, though, if you could checkout
the change, try it out, and report back on the list if it works for
you.

To get the change, you will need to have obtained the source via git.
If this is the case, go to your ParaView source directory and enter

git fetch http://review.source.kitware.com/p/ParaView refs/topics/37/4837/1
git checkout FETCH_HEAD -b 15044_update_example_plugins

This will download my topic branch and check it out in your local
repository. Compile it again and test.

Thanks,
Cory

Cory:

I did as you explained. The fixes work:
After 'make clean' in the examples directory and 'make all';

Tools -> Manage Plugins -> load libRepresentation.so
1. The representation plugin works correctly (After loading e.g. Box
source, gives the representation "Special Mapper")

Tools -> Manage Plugins -> load libHiddenLinesRemoval.so
2. The HiddenLinesRemoval plugin works correctly as well. (After loading
e.g. Box source, gives the representation "Visible Wireframe", which
works as expected)
 
Regards,
Bertwim

Subject: [Paraview] Contour volume quantification (volume fractions of a
 scalar in an unstructured grid)
Message-ID: <CA+a4HHTy+HpjAYEbwSGPsEZQsmNUDHGMNixN9su3DLeZhCs9cg@mail.gmail.com>

Good day,

I would like to calculate the volume contained by each contour surface
applied to an unstructured dataset. How do I do this?

Here is what I have:
1. An 3D unstructured grid resulting from a CFD code (OpenFOAM) with
velocities (Ux, Uy, Uz)
2. Applied the "Calculator" filter to calculate Result Array = Umagnitude
from the point data with the formula (U_X^2+U_Y^2+U_Z^2)^.5
    (I used point data for the calculator because I can only apply contour
to point data)
3. Applied the "Contour" filter, and generated 11 volumetric contours (from
0.0 to 0.3 m/s)

Here is where I am stuck (and what I intend):
*. Trying to calculate the volume inside each contour surface

The reason I want to calculate this:
* To calculate a distribution of velocity magnitudes (where the X axis is
velocity magnitude ranges /bins, and Y axis is total volume occupied by the
cells in each velocity magnitude range -- not cell count as is the case of
histograms)

My Paraview version:
* 4.2 running on Win64
(I also have aversion of paraview 4.1 modified to work with OpenFOAM, and
installed in a Ubuntu64x-12.04 virtual box)

Thank you very much in advance,

Jose

Subject: [Paraview] sources: why redundant number of points needed?
Message-ID: <54393D62.30905@xs4all.nl>

Hi,

When I look into the source code of vtkCubeSource.cpp,
I noticed that, although  a (rectangular) 3D box can be described by
8 3D points and 6 2D faces (hence also 6 3D normal vectors),
in the actual code of vtkCubeBoxSource:RequestData() there are 24 3D
points generated,
with for every point a normal (???), and indeed 6 faces (polys).
Why is there this redundancy?

I bumped on this when I applied the "HiddenLineRemoval" representation to
my own handcrafted box (with 8 points, 6 faces and 6 normals). It yielded
an incorrect view whereas the box with the redundant numbers of data
gave the correct one. But I don't get the logic.

Regards,
Bertwim

Bertwim,

You are right that there is a redundancy in points. That stems from
the need for defining different normals at the corner points for each
face. In theory, you could define more than one normal for the same
point and associate it with a face, but that complicates the data
structure. It is much simpler to duplicate points and associate
exactly one normal per point.

In most polygonal data, you won't see duplicated points at most
places. But for anything that should be displayed with a sharp edge,
duplicate points will be present.

Cory,

So indeed there has to be a normal *per point and per face*, and not
*per face*?
And, likewise, points are not shared between adjacent faces.
I had overlooked that detail in the documentation, tacitly assuming that
"of course"
the normals are  *per face*.

Regards,
Bertwim

Bertwim,

In fact, with Gouraud shading enabled (the default in ParaView when
point normals are available), normals are defined only per point - no
face normal is needed. If you change the Interpolation to Flat under
the "Lighting" section in the Properties panel, only the face normal
will be computed and used for lighting, but objects with smooth
surfaces, such as spheres, won't be rendered very nicely - edges
between adjacent faces will be sharp.

For a general overview of Gouraud shading and some background on what
is needed for getting sharp edges, please see

http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb324491(v=vs.85).aspx

It is geared towards Direct3D, but the same concepts apply to OpenGL
and in turn VTK and ParaView.

Cory

Hi Simon,

What you are doing as a workaround is indeed how production builds
should be created. The ParaView superbuild is now set up to check out
the master branch of ParaView, which varies day to day. In 4.1 and
prior to that, it was set up to check out out the release branch,
which was far more static. If you disable ParaView_FROM_GIT in CMake,
it will download the release source tar ball and build from that,
essentially what you have been doing.

I'll update the superbuild wiki instructions to note this.

Best regards,
Cory

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView 4.2.0 client/server execution error
In-Reply-To: <mailman.6097.1412995043.4706.paraview@paraview.org>
References: <mailman.6097.1412995043.4706.paraview@paraview.org>

I haven't worked on client-server mode, but building Paraview with 
OSMesa was a very challenging exercise, and I used it for my 
workstation. Not sure if these notes would help here. Nevertheless, it 
may be pertinent for installation notes.

1) Build OSMesa (obtained from the paraview wiki, and this is for 
vanilla OsMesa).
   $ ./configure CXXFLAGS=-O2 -g -DDEFAULT_SOFTWARE_DEPTH_BITS=31 
CFLAGS=-O2 -g -DDEFAULT_SOFTWARE_DEPTH_BITS=31 --disable-xvmc 
--disable-glx --disable-dri --with-dri-drivers= --with-gallium-drivers= 
--enable-texture-float --disable-shared-glapi --disable-egl 
--with-egl-platforms= --enable-osmesa --enable-gallium-llvm=no 
--prefix=/home/praveen/software/osmesa_vanilla_install

2) Use ccmake+superbuild to build paraview, configuring repeatedly. I 
had managed several paraview builds with my system mpi (from ubuntu) but 
somehow, on that particular day, cmake rejected all of them, and hence 
the superbuild install asking it to download mpi and build.
3) For some reason, it would default to using 2 MPI tasks, which we 
should change in the ncurses menu. Likewise, the max number of threads 
is specified as 64. I am not sure what this would imply.
4) I think it is enough to turn on the OPENGL_HAS_OSMESA flag for it to 
use OsMesa.
5) Next, we specify the path for the OsMesa installation (we can point 
to any of the OsMesa builds, such as Gallium or Nouveau).

If I recall correctly, ccmake complains if we turn on the GUI. I wonder 
if these failures have something to do with the flavor of OsMesa used.

Subject: [Paraview] Using PythonProgrammableFilter as a reader
Message-ID: <543AC1C1.9060309@tul.cz>

Hi,

I'm trying to use vtkPythonProgrammableFilter to implement a reader in
Python. The problem is in passing the filename (form the filebrowser
dialog) to the python script (the RequestData script). I need a method
in vtkPythonProgrammableFilter with one char * argument that can behave
like SetFileName(char *) to set this method to command property in the
XML file. Unfortunately, this scheme is not compatible with SetParameter
methods of vtkPythonProgrammableFilter. Finally, I find a hack using the
method SetProgressText (from vtkAlgorithm) instead of SetFileName. So my
XML looks like:

<ServerManagerConfiguration>
  <ProxyGroup name="sources">
    <SourceProxy name="EGrid Reader"
		 class="vtkPythonProgrammableFilter"
		 label="EGrid Reader">
      <StringVectorProperty
            name="FileName"
            animateable="0"
            command="SetProgressText"
            number_of_elements="1"
            panel_visibility="advanced">
        <FileListDomain name="files"/>
      </StringVectorProperty>
      <IntVectorProperty command="SetOutputDataSetType"
                         default_values="4"
                         name="OutputDataSetType"
                         number_of_elements="1"
                         panel_visibility="never">
      </IntVectorProperty>
      <StringVectorProperty
        name="Script"
        command="SetScript"
        number_of_elements="1"
        default_values="print self.GetProgressText()"
        panel_visibility="advanced">
        <Hints>
         <Widget type="multi_line"/>
       </Hints>
      </StringVectorProperty>
      <Hints>
        <ReaderFactory extensions="egrid"
                       file_description="Eclipse mesh File Format" />
     </Hints>
    </SourceProxy>
  </ProxyGroup>
</ServerManagerConfiguration>

Is there a beter way how to pass the filename to the script? If not,
could a SetFileName method be implemented in vtkPythonProgrammableFilter
that simply calls

SetParameter("FileName", the_path)

?

Thank you for a help,
Jan

I am not sure I follow why SetParameter won't work in your case.
Something like following is what I often end up using for such cases.

   <StringVectorProperty
        name="FileName"
        label="FileName"
        initial_string="FileName"
        command="SetParameter"
        animateable="1"
        default_values=""
        number_of_elements="1">
        <Documentation></Documentation>
        <FileListDomain name="files"/>
     </StringVectorProperty>

Hi Cory,

you are correct. This tiny change solves the problem! I hope that our
discussion will also allow others to review their output code with
respect to this change.

Thank you very much for clarification and your help (and your great
software as well).

Best regards
Philipp Engels

Philipp,

Great, I'm glad to hear it is working again as you expect.

Subject: Re: [Paraview] ParaView 4.2.0 client/server execution error on SGI UV System (UNCLASSIFIED)

The client has created the representation glyph3d, but the server hasn?t got it compiled in by the looks of it, so the create representation fails.
Does it get skipped when using osmesa (and hence doesn?t exist on the server)?

I?m not certain of this, but it happens all the time with the same error when one of my plugins that create a representation is loaded on the client - but not on the server.

Given the new features of the python calculator, it ought not to be difficult to compute volumes. I would do it iteratively, using an Isovolume between two different values [min, max]

However, I find that the clipper, or isovolume filter do not seem to always create consistently oriented cells. By that I mean that some cells are returned with negative volumes, and that throws off the global computation totally.

the python calculator can let you type in an expression like volume(inputs[0]), which would compute a cell-by-cell volume (left image in the attached script)

We can also do a global summation like sum(volume(inputs[0])) (right image in my script)

using well-behaved cuts (such as orthonormal cuts), and flipping the clipper's normal by toggling "inside out", I do get global volumes that add up to the full volume = 20^3 = 8000. Anything else with arbitrary cuts (as per my python scripts) show volumes which do not add up to the global volume, because of the negative volumes cells. I hope I am not making errors here. Can anyone confirm my findings about negative volumes?

Subject: [Paraview] Contour volume quantification (volume fractions of a scalar in an unstructured grid)

Good day,

I would like to calculate the volume contained by each contour surface applied to an unstructured dataset. How do I do this?

Here is what I have:
1. An 3D unstructured grid resulting from a CFD code (OpenFOAM) with velocities (Ux, Uy, Uz)
2. Applied the "Calculator" filter to calculate Result Array = Umagnitude from the point data with the formula (U_X^2+U_Y^2+U_Z^2)^.5
    (I used point data for the calculator because I can only apply contour to point data)
3. Applied the "Contour" filter, and generated 11 volumetric contours (from 0.0 to 0.3 m/s)

Here is where I am stuck (and what I intend):
*. Trying to calculate the volume inside each contour surface

The reason I want to calculate this:
* To calculate a distribution of velocity magnitudes (where the X axis is velocity magnitude ranges /bins, and Y axis is total volume occupied by the cells in each velocity magnitude range -- not cell count as is the case of histograms)

My Paraview version:
* 4.2 running on Win64
(I also have aversion of paraview 4.1 modified to work with OpenFOAM, and installed in a Ubuntu64x-12.04 virtual box)

Thank you very much in advance,

Jose

Hi Simon,

What you are doing as a workaround is indeed how production builds should be 
created. The ParaView superbuild is now set up to check out the master branch 
of ParaView, which varies day to day. In 4.1 and prior to that, it was set up 
to check out out the release branch, which was far more static. If you disable 
ParaView_FROM_GIT in CMake, it will download the release source tar ball and 
build from that, essentially what you have been doing.

I'll update the superbuild wiki instructions to note this.

Best regards,
Cory

Subject: [Paraview] Disappearing volume rendering?
Message-ID: <543BDF78.3090909@xs4all.nl>

Hi,

I'm struggling to get a proper 3D view of my model system (yes,
embarrassing!)
but must admit my defeat.
After stripping almost everything, keeping the minimum to exhibit the
issue,
I'm left with the following:

I have created a simple box source. To get a 3D representation, I
sub-classed
the code for this Source from vtkUnstructuredGridAlgorithm.

In the RequestData method, I define the 8 point of the unit cube. I
added the points to the
underlying unstructed grid, and I specified the cell topology.

This all seems to work: when instantiating this box Source, I *do* get the
expected cube in the representations (Surface, wireframe, Points).

However, when I select the "Volume" representation, *the image disappears*
What am I doing wrong?

As the code is not too long and very simple, I take the freedom to paste
it below.

Kind regards.
Bertwim

You can create a wavelet source and then display it as a volume.

Bertwim,

I'm not sure that the volume renderer can handle VTK_HEXAHEDRON
elements. Try the "Tetrahedralize" filter on your source and see if
the Volume representation works.

Thanks,

I believe that is correct.  Run the Tetrahedralize filter and see if that
works.

No, it doesn't work. The filter creates tets, which are visible in the
wireframe representation,
but when I select "Volume"  representation the image disappears.

I can't imagine it is so difficult to render a volume in Paraview. I
must be doing something wrong....

do you have any scalars? those are not optional for volume rendering. 
Additionally you may need to adjust the transfer function,

Aashish,

Thanks for the suggestion.

However, doing this gives me all kinds of opengl errors (invalid
instruction).

Besides that, the wavelet gives me a cube indeed, but I need to
understand when
I can have a volume rendering. I created new Source's (e.g. tri-prism, a
wedge,
a box with boundaries of finite thickness etc.). But I cannot get volume
rendering
to work, grrrrrr. (See other thread)

Kind Regards,
Bertwim

So when you created a wavelet source and change the representation to
volume you got the errors? Can you post those errors?

Thanks,

Yes, I do set a scalar for each cell. I left them out in the example, as
also with a scalar I couldn't get a volume display.

I'm not sure what you mean by "adjusting the transfer function".

Bertwim

Hi Aashish,

This is what I do:
1. start paraview
2. Sources -> Wavelet -> Apply.
     A cube is displayed (Outline representation).
3. Select 'Volume" representation"

cube disappears. Then:

Bertwim,

If you are seeing errors (like you mentioned in other email), I am afraid
that you won't see any volume. Would it be possible for you to upload your
data somewhere?

Aashish,

I do see errors in the wavelet example, but not in the other cases. If
ok with you , I'll send the full code (it is not much, ~100K) as a
zipped tar file by email. There is no other data.

Regards,
Bertwim

Cory, Bertwin, et al.;

The exact volume of an arbitrarily oriented, arbitrary 8-vertex 
hexahedron can be computed with a very elementary construct.

First, place an average-coordinate point at the center of the 
hexahedron; this point will be a common vertex point for a set of 
tetrahedrons whose construction follows.

Second, visiting the six faces of the hexahedron, place an 
average-coordinate point at the center of the quadrilateral polygonal face.
For each of the four triangles, construct the four tetrahedrons using 
the center point above of the parent hexahedron.

The only limitation is that the arbitrary 8-vertex hexhedron must be 
star-convex with respect to the hexaheron's average-coordinate center 
point. This construct works for triangular prisms and pyramids with a 
quadrilateral base.

Once one has the coordinates of four vertex nodes defining a 
tetrahedron, the volume calculation of a tetrahedron is straight 
forward. Clearly, the total volume of the hexahedron is the sum of its 
24 tetrahedral decomposition volumes.

If an n-vertex polyhedron finite element's mean quadrature gradient 
operator is constructed the same way as above, then the above construct 
works for the n-vertex polyhedron.

If an iso-surface transects the edges of an 8-node hexahedron and the 
resulting two sibling n-vertex polyhedrons are used as individual finite 
elements (which has been done), then the the above construct also 
provides exact volume fractions with respect to the two sibling n-vertex 
polyhedrons. The polygonal intersection surface need not be planar surface.

If multiple, non-intersecting iso-surfaces transect a hexahedron, then 
the respective volume fractions within the hexahedron can exactly be 
calculated inductively.

Cory, If you want to follow up off-line, I can provide a more lengthy 
write up with references plus example coding. Because of computational 
costs, I don't recommend this algorithm except in a user-invoked filter.

Samuel,

Thanks for taking the efforts to dive into this.
In fact, it is a good reminder to me to try a single tetraeder first. My
primary problem seems to be that
I cannot get volume rendering to work.

Kind Regards,
Bertwim

Hi Joe,

I've seen this before and there is a bug report in mantis here:

http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=13382

There has also been a patch posted to the vtk-developers list a while back
although I haven't tested it:

When doing a clean production build, it?s very  useful to be able to do a
?git pull? to get all of the correct tarballs downloaded.   The
functionality that was previous to 4.2.0 was exactly appropriate - ?git
checkout v4.1.0?

The alternative (as I understand it) is to enable GIT and do a build from
the development tree.  (This will pull all of the tarballs for the
supporting libraries).   Then re-run the build with ?GIT=OFF? , manually
download the production tarball, and then re-run the build.   Does this
sound like the best solution?

Rick,

Are you taking referring to  the "v4.1.0" tag on the superbuild repo?
I'll add the v4.2.0 tag soon -- it just slipped my mind. Sorry about
that.

Yes - we want the 4.2.0 tag on the Superbuild (and for all future
production releases).   In an earlier message on the this thread, Corey
implied that it was no longer supported ?.  of course, at this point we?re
more or less done  with the 4.2.0 implementation.  Next time, it would be
nice to have when the production release is announced!   8-)

Doh! I see I added the tag but forgot to toggle the git/branch name,
which for 4.1.0 I had set to be "release". I'll add a new "v4.2.0-1"
tag fixing this issue.

Again, really sorry about this :/.

Hi, Paul,

Thanks for the pointers.

Hi Joe,

I've seen this before and there is a bug report in mantis here:

http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=13382

There has also been a patch posted to the vtk-developers list a while back although I haven't tested it:

Hi,

I have a serial vtu dataset provided by one of my users.  Their current code can produce this in either ascii or inline binary.  I am currently trying to convert this to appended binary (ultimately to pvtu with appended binary).
I'm having trouble, which I now believe may stem from the data containing VTK_POLYHEDRON.

I have a simple python script that I use with pvbatch to do this conversion, but I see the same results when I load the original data set with ParaView (4.1.0, in client/server mode), and use the Save Data option and save as vtu.
I get the same results for each input format (ascii or inline binary), and output format (ascii, binary, appended).

The first few lines of the original vtu file look like this:

<?xml version="1.0"?>
  <VTKFile type="UnstructuredGrid" version="0.1" byte_order="BigEndian">
  <UnstructuredGrid>
    <Piece NumberOfPoints="1699427" NumberOfCells="384126">

The first few lines of the converted file look like this:

offset="177748206"ructuredGrid" version="0.1" byte_order="LittleEndian">
  <UnstructuredGrid>
    <Piece NumberOfPoints="1699427"              NumberOfCells="384126"              >


Something is clearly getting jumbled at the beginning of the converted file.  If I manually edit the header of the file to read  <VTKFile type="UnstructuredGrid", there are still problems with the file.  In that case the info tab in ParaView reports the correct number of points and cells, but no geometry is drawn.   I have successfully converted other vtu files using this same method.  The primary difference that I've been able to identify is that the files that are not converting happily contain VTK_POLYHEDRON elements.

Has anyone else seen similar behavior?

Thanks,
joe

Hi Bertwim,

In recent releases of ParaView I have experienced issues/flakeyness with 
volume rendering. Something you should try: Create the wavelet source, 
then in the properties panel find "volume rendering mode" and set it to 
"ray cast only".  This has worked for me on a number of systems. may or 
may not work, but worth a try.

The output you pasted below shows that although you've got a sweet ATI 
GPU you're not taking advantage of it! You're using the Intel integrated 
GPU with Mesa drivers. If I were you I would install proprietary the AMD 
drivers <http://support.amd.com/en-us/download>. This should give you 
nice performance boost and may even solve the OpenGL errors you 
reported, which these days are as often (or more) a result of bugs in 
the Mesa drivers than in VTK.

Hi Burlen,

I have upgraded to the AMD drivers. Thanks for the hint. It has improved
the situation a bit.

Furthermore, I created the wavelet source. When selecting "volume"
representation, I do see a three 3 picture, in all 5 volume rendering
mode (smart, raycast and texture mapping, ray cast only, texture mapping
only, GPU based). The picture a rather fuzzy, but then I don't know what
I'm supposed to see here. The good news is that the openGL errors I had
before when displaying a wavelet, now have gone.

The situation with my own cube, though, has unchanged. unfortunately. 
The cube disappears in "volume" representation node, also when I 
re-inserted scalar values for each of the 8 vertices.

Regards,
Bertwim

Hello,

We have several HPC systems that we compile/install different ParaView
releases. We are wondering what would be a good test to verify that pvserver
compiled is actually running on the system. Is there like a python script
that when we run on the new installation, and it worked, we have a good
confidence that the compilation/installation of the ParaView released is
working? Will "a plot of a sphere + the process id scalar filter + save
output to image = beach ball image" a good verification test?

Thanks

Simon,

Yup, that'd be a perfect test (attached).

You should run it with pvbatch.

progress!  it sounds like volume rendering is working on the wavelet 
dataset.

You do need the scalars for volume rendering, so make sure you have 
those when you try. You need to select the scalars in the drop down 
also, I usually do this before changing to the volume representation. 
You also may need to edit the transfer function. For testing you could 
make the opacity over the entire scalar range in which case you should 
see a solid cube.

If you've done all that and don't see anything it's likely that the 
dataset is messed up.  Add a dataset->Print(cerr) statement to the end 
of your request data,  look in the information panel and verify correct 
number of points and scalar ranges.

If all else fails post the dataset to the list. After creating your cube 
go to the file menu and "save data".

Subject: [Paraview] Export to vtk file needed to get colours!
Message-ID: <543D8640.9050504@xs4all.nl>

Hello All,

I wonder if I stumbled upon a bug, or if I made a thinking error myself.

The issue is: I can get colouring of my Source object only after I write
it first to a vtk file and then read it back again!

This is what I do:

-) I create a single (rectangular) 3D cell from a (handcrafted) Source type,
     subclassed from vtkUnstructuredGridAlgorithm.
    This cell has scalar properties assigned to both its vertices as
well as the cell itself.

-)  After "Apply", the box becomes visible (surface representation)
     However, there are no colours. The "Coloring" section in the
     Properties panel does not show the scalar properties. Only
     "Solid Color" and "cellNormals" appear as combo-options.

-)   After writing the model to a vtk file, and loading the latter, the
     loaded box does appear in its coloured form, with the scalar
properties
     selectable in the "Coloring" combo box.    

Why do the colours not show up immediately after I created ("Apply") the
source object. I naively tried a Modified() on the underlying unstructed
grid object,
but that didn't help.

For completeness, I paste the relevant code as well as the vtk file (ascii).

Kind Regards,
Bertwim

Bertwim,

Try naming your arrays, e.g.

vtxdata->SetName("Point Scalars");
vxldata->SetName("Cell Scalars");

and see if that makes them appear in the Coloring combo box.

Thanks,
Cory

Progress indeed. But I don't understand what you are saying about the
transfer function.

I' starting to wonder if I have two issues occurring simultaneously.
In a new thread I just posted I described my problem in getting the
colours in place.
I need to write to a vtk file first and load it back.  I just found that
when I just did that
and then switched fo volume rendering, an error was there about the absence
of an opengl extension:

ERROR: In
/usr/local/git/ParaView/VTK/Rendering/VolumeOpenGL/vtkOpenGLProjectedTetrahedraMapper.cxx,
line 185
vtkOpenGLProjectedTetrahedraMapper (0x58ae490): The required extensions
are not supported.

 This is complete unknown terrain for me.

Regards,
Bertwim

Looks like certain extensions are still not quite working on yours system
even with the proprietary driver. I will see if I can run your code on my
laptop but that would be for tomorrow.

** Assuming that this is not data dependent issue (which it should not).

I think its probably this line causing the issue:

bool driverSupport #if defined(__APPLE__) = true; #else = !(extensions->
DriverIsATI() && (extensions->GetDriverGLVersionMajor() >= 3)) || extensions
->GetIgnoreDriverBugs("ATI texturing bug"); #endif

On line number 181: can you change this code to :

this->HasHardwareSupport = renwin != NULL && this->IsSupported(renwin);
to
this->HasHardwareSupport = 1;

Burlen/ Aashish/ B.W.H,
I haven?t been following this thread, but just a note that there is a bug already written about this code, and a similar (but not exact) error.  Said bug report is here:   http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=15020  It is slated to be fixed in a minor release within the next few months.

You could try it without modifying any code by setting  the following cmake variable.

VTK_IGNORE_GLDRIVER_BUGS:BOOL=ON

and recompile ParaView. With my ATI Radeon HD7780 projected tetrahedra just hangs.

Looks like certain extensions are still not quite working on yours system even with the proprietary driver. I will see if I can run your code on my laptop but that would be for tomorrow.

** Assuming that this is not data dependent issue (which it should not).

I think its probably this line causing the issue:


bool
                  driverSupport










 #if
                    defined(__APPLE__)











                  = true;











                    #else











                  = !(extensions->DriverIsATI()











                  &&
                  (extensions->GetDriverGLVersionMajor() >= 3))











                  || extensions->GetIgnoreDriverBugs("ATI texturing bug");











                    #endif














On line number 181: can you change this code to :

this->HasHardwareSupport
          =
          renwin
          !=
          NULL
          &&
          this->IsSupported(renwin);
to
this->HasHardwareSupport
          =
            1;

Progress indeed. But I don't understand what you are saying about the transfer function.

I' starting to wonder if I have two issues occurring simultaneously.
In a new thread I just posted I described my problem in getting the colours in place.
I need to write to a vtk file first and load it back.  I just found that when I just did that
and then switched fo volume rendering, an error was there about the absence
of an opengl extension:

ERROR: In /usr/local/git/ParaView/VTK/Rendering/VolumeOpenGL/vtkOpenGLProjectedTetrahedraMapper.cxx, line 185
vtkOpenGLProjectedTetrahedraMapper (0x58ae490): The required extensions are not supported.

 This is complete unknown terrain for me.

progress!  it sounds like volume rendering is working on the wavelet dataset.

You do need the scalars for volume rendering, so make sure you have those when you try. You need to select the scalars in the drop down also, I usually do this before changing to the volume representation. You also may need to edit the transfer function. For testing you could make the opacity over the entire scalar range in which case you should see a solid cube.

If you've done all that and don't see anything it's likely that the dataset is messed up.  Add a dataset->Print(cerr) statement to the end of your request data,  look in the information panel and verify correct number of points and scalar ranges.

If all else fails post the dataset to the list. After creating your cube go to the file menu and "save data".

Hi Burlen,

I have upgraded to the AMD drivers. Thanks for the hint. It has improved the situation a bit.

Furthermore, I created the wavelet source. When selecting "volume" representation, I do see a three 3 picture, in all 5 volume rendering mode (smart, raycast and texture mapping, ray cast only, texture mapping only, GPU based). The picture a rather fuzzy, but then I don't know what I'm supposed to see here. The good news is that the openGL errors I had before when displaying a wavelet, now have gone.

The situation with my own cube, though, has unchanged. unfortunately.
The cube disappears in "volume" representation node, also when I  re-inserted scalar values for each of the 8 vertices.

Bertwim

Hi Bertwim,

In recent releases of ParaView I have experienced issues/flakeyness with volume rendering. Something you should try: Create the wavelet source, then in the properties panel find "volume rendering mode" and set it to "ray cast only".  This has worked for me on a number of systems. may or may not work, but worth a try.

The output you pasted below shows that although you've got a sweet ATI GPU you're not taking advantage of it! You're using the Intel integrated GPU with Mesa drivers. If I were you I would install proprietary the AMD drivers<http://support.amd.com/en-us/download>. This should give you nice performance boost and may even solve the OpenGL errors you reported, which these days are as often (or more) a result of bugs in the Mesa drivers than in VTK.

Aashish,

Thanks for the suggestion.

However, doing this gives me all kinds of opengl errors (invalid instruction).

Besides that, the wavelet gives me a cube indeed, but I need to understand when
I can have a volume rendering. I created new Source's (e.g. tri-prism, a wedge,
a box with boundaries of finite thickness etc.). But I cannot get volume rendering
to work, grrrrrr. (See other thread)

Kind Regards,
Bertwim

When I create a new source (say: a box) I get an a box that

But I need a volume rendering (so that I can add e.g. a clipping plane)
How do I get that?

Hi Alan,

That is a different issue. You're  seeing that warning because your Mesa 
build is missing floating point support. Some of the older releases 
didn't have it, however newer releases do. It's always been a build 
option that's off by default because of patent issues, so you need to 
expeictly enable it when compiling mesa. The intention behind that (in 
hindsight annoying)  warning is to alert you are using an ancient 
version of mesa and or that you may have not built mesa with floating 
point support. At the time the warning seemed reasonable to me since 
without floating point support the projected tets algorithm *could 
produce precision related artifacts depending on data and rendering 
parameters and downloading and installing a newer mesa (or simply 
recompiling your existing mesa build with floating point support 
enabled) is a relatively easy fix. For me I'd rather know that there's 
potentially a problem and update mesa, rather than scratch my head about 
why there are artifacts in my rendering.

With regard to the current thread and Bertwim's issue with ATI GPU, I 
think the code is currently doing the right thing because projected tets 
algorithm hangs on the ATI card.

A workaround if you have an ATI card is to set the "select mapper" to 
"Bunyk ray cast"

Understand.  I replied into the bug itself, but the simple answer is that I didn?t build this version of Mesa ? it was provided by a vender and I have no control over it.  And it has to work on this version of Mesa, as it has before.

Hi Alan,

That is a different issue. You're  seeing that warning because your Mesa build is missing floating point support. Some of the older releases didn't have it, however newer releases do. It's always been a build option that's off by default because of patent issues, so you need to expeictly enable it when compiling mesa. The intention behind that (in hindsight annoying)  warning is to alert you are using an ancient version of mesa and or that you may have not built mesa with floating point support. At the time the warning seemed reasonable to me since without floating point support the projected tets algorithm *could produce precision related artifacts depending on data and rendering parameters and downloading and installing a newer mesa (or simply recompiling your existing mesa build with floating point support enabled) is a relatively easy fix. For me I'd rather know that there's potentially a problem and update mesa, rather than scratch my head about why there are artifacts in my rendering.

With regard to the current thread and Bertwim's issue with ATI GPU, I think the code is currently doing the right thing because projected tets algorithm hangs on the ATI card.

A workaround if you have an ATI card is to set the "select mapper" to "Bunyk ray cast"

I haven?t been following this thread, but just a note that there is a bug already written about this code, and a similar (but not exact) error.  Said bug report is here:   http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=15020  It is slated to be fixed in a minor release within the next few months.

You could try it without modifying any code by setting  the following cmake variable.

VTK_IGNORE_GLDRIVER_BUGS:BOOL=ON

and recompile ParaView. With my ATI Radeon HD7780 projected tetrahedra just hangs.

I think its probably this line causing the issue:


bool

 #if
                    defined(__APPLE__)












                  = true;

                  = !(extensions->DriverIsATI()












                  &&
                  (extensions->GetDriverGLVersionMajor() >= 3))












                  || extensions->GetIgnoreDriverBugs("ATI texturing bug");












                    #endif















On line number 181: can you change this code to :

this->HasHardwareSupport
          =
          renwin
          !=
          NULL
          &&
          this->IsSupported(renwin);
to
this->HasHardwareSupport
          =
            1;

Progress indeed. But I don't understand what you are saying about the transfer function.

I' starting to wonder if I have two issues occurring simultaneously.
In a new thread I just posted I described my problem in getting the colours in place.
I need to write to a vtk file first and load it back.  I just found that when I just did that
and then switched fo volume rendering, an error was there about the absence
of an opengl extension:

ERROR: In /usr/local/git/ParaView/VTK/Rendering/VolumeOpenGL/vtkOpenGLProjectedTetrahedraMapper.cxx, line 185
vtkOpenGLProjectedTetrahedraMapper (0x58ae490): The required extensions are not supported.

 This is complete unknown terrain for me.

progress!  it sounds like volume rendering is working on the wavelet dataset.

You do need the scalars for volume rendering, so make sure you have those when you try. You need to select the scalars in the drop down also, I usually do this before changing to the volume representation. You also may need to edit the transfer function. For testing you could make the opacity over the entire scalar range in which case you should see a solid cube.

If you've done all that and don't see anything it's likely that the dataset is messed up.  Add a dataset->Print(cerr) statement to the end of your request data,  look in the information panel and verify correct number of points and scalar ranges.

If all else fails post the dataset to the list. After creating your cube go to the file menu and "save data".

Hi Burlen,

I have upgraded to the AMD drivers. Thanks for the hint. It has improved the situation a bit.

Furthermore, I created the wavelet source. When selecting "volume" representation, I do see a three 3 picture, in all 5 volume rendering mode (smart, raycast and texture mapping, ray cast only, texture mapping only, GPU based). The picture a rather fuzzy, but then I don't know what I'm supposed to see here. The good news is that the openGL errors I had before when displaying a wavelet, now have gone.

The situation with my own cube, though, has unchanged. unfortunately.
The cube disappears in "volume" representation node, also when I  re-inserted scalar values for each of the 8 vertices.

Bertwim

Hi Bertwim,

In recent releases of ParaView I have experienced issues/flakeyness with volume rendering. Something you should try: Create the wavelet source, then in the properties panel find "volume rendering mode" and set it to "ray cast only".  This has worked for me on a number of systems. may or may not work, but worth a try.

The output you pasted below shows that although you've got a sweet ATI GPU you're not taking advantage of it! You're using the Intel integrated GPU with Mesa drivers. If I were you I would install proprietary the AMD drivers<http://support.amd.com/en-us/download>. This should give you nice performance boost and may even solve the OpenGL errors you reported, which these days are as often (or more) a result of bugs in the Mesa drivers than in VTK.

Hi Aashish,

This is what I do:
1. start paraview
2. Sources -> Wavelet -> Apply.
     A cube is displayed (Outline representation).
3. Select 'Volume" representation"

cube disappears. Then:

Aashish,

Thanks for the suggestion.

However, doing this gives me all kinds of opengl errors (invalid instruction).

Besides that, the wavelet gives me a cube indeed, but I need to understand when
I can have a volume rendering. I created new Source's (e.g. tri-prism, a wedge,
a box with boundaries of finite thickness etc.). But I cannot get volume rendering
to work, grrrrrr. (See other thread)

Kind Regards,
Bertwim

But I need a volume rendering (so that I can add e.g. a clipping plane)
How do I get that?

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView with VirtualGL
Message-ID: <CAKU98SLNf8OHLo_REbizWO2BaUL+vQy9QiMdGR-5b32_msTmVw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm running ParaView via VirtualGL through a remote host, and
experiencing some difficulties.  The host has me set an env variable,
export NO_HOSTSORT=1 (and I'm not sure what this is trying to
accomplish).

Paraview for the most part runs fine, but when I try to run a
programmable python filter, I get no output to the output window to
speak of.  For example, just typing

print "anything"

does nothing.  Does anyone have any suggestions?

Thanks,
Craig

the warning is just a warning the algorithm continues to work as it had 
in the past. (right?) Maybe the warning could be removed in release builds.

Subject: [Paraview] Unable to compile with Python enabled
Message-ID: <543E3C0D.1040203@ivec.org>

Hi,
   Okay spent a couple days experimenting with building Paraview-4.1 and 
4.2. on our local GPU-cluster it is The SGI supercomputer comprises 96 
nodes, each containing two 6-core Intel Xeon X5650 CPUs, an NVIDIA Tesla 
C2075 GPU and 72 GB RAM, resulting in a system containing 1152 cores and 
96 GPUs.

I keep hitting the build.make errors when I set
-DPARAVIEW_ENABLE_PYTHON:BOOL=ON
-DUSE_SYSTEM_python:BOOL=ON
-DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE:FILEPATH=$PYTHON_DIR/bin/python
-DPYTHON_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=$PYTHONPATH
-DPYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR:PATH=$PYTHON_DIR/include/python$PYTHON_LIB_VERSION

The error....

make[2]: Entering directory 
`/group/director100/cbording/vis/build/ParaView-v4.1.0/paraview-build'
VTK/Utilities/PythonInterpreter/CMakeFiles/vtkPythonInterpreter.dir/build.make:127: 
*** target pattern contains no `%'.  Stop.

if I go to the 
VTK/Utilities/PythonInterpreter/CmakeFiles/vtkPythonInterpreter.dir

[cbording at login2 PythonInterpreter]$ cd CMakeFiles/
[cbording at login2 CMakeFiles]$ ls
CMakeDirectoryInformation.cmake  progress.marks

[cbording at login2 vtkPythonInterpreter.dir]$ pwd
/group/director100/cbording/vis/build/ParaView-v4.1.0/paraview-build/VTK/Utilities/PythonInterpreter/CMakeFiles/vtkPythonInterpreter.dir

so build.make is there and offending line is in RED

If I configure the build without python then it does not fail.  I have 
tried with both python version 2.6.9 and 2.7.6

Do I have the right flags set for python.
more importantly to I have the right configure flags set so we can run 
the pvserver and have it use the GPUs?
The ultimate goal is to be able to render on the cluster and view on the 
multi-display panels we have.

Next I want to install paraview on our new CRAY XC-30, any suggestions 
on configuring that?

I found this in the from the good folks at CSCS for their CRAY XC-30 
however ours is all Haswell without GPUs.

We also have a SGI UV2000 has anyone installed paraview on large single 
image systems?

Thanks in advance!

Chris,

Maybe try the http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Superbuild route?

I can confirm that for ParaView v4.2.0-1 and Superbuild, ParaView is
building for CRAY XC-30, SGI UV

And we are building it with -DUSE_SYSTEM_python:BOOL=OFF

HTH,
-simon

Hi,
  Okay spent a couple days experimenting with building Paraview-4.1 and 4.2.
on our local GPU-cluster it is The SGI supercomputer comprises 96 nodes,
each containing two 6-core Intel Xeon X5650 CPUs, an NVIDIA Tesla C2075 GPU
and 72 GB RAM, resulting in a system containing 1152 cores and 96 GPUs.


I keep hitting the build.make errors when I set

Message-ID: <CA+sJ3g5e+STTWxgMzrS1PGkYiSzPZG1gsg9BFEp2ux70VaPR=g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I am currently getting the following error message when running a matplot
lib script through a ParaView derived application.

lib/paraview-4.2/site-packages/twisted/internet/_sslverify.py:184:
UserWarning: You do not have the service_identity module installed. Please
install it from <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/service_identity>. Without
the service_identity module and a recent enough pyOpenSSL tosupport it,
Twisted can perform only rudimentary TLS client hostnameverification.  Many
valid certificate/hostname mappings may be rejected.
  verifyHostname, VerificationError = _selectVerifyImplementation()

I have tried various things:
-- installing  python3-openssl
-- installing python-pip and through that service_identity.
-- recompiles tce.

However, the message keeps coming up. I am running Ubuntu 14.04 using the
git ParaView. Has anyone else seen this? Any ideas are welcome.

Cheers

I am not sure why that module is being imported. Is something

Ah, okay, I figured out part of my problem.  I had to connect to the
server and display the output on the server side, not just the client
side, which I guess is where the print commands redirects.  Now I have
several other problems.  First:

1) the print command outputs n_processor number of outputs.  Can I
make this just one value?  For example, if I am summing a value over a
mesh, I just want to total value output once over the entire mesh?  Is
this possible?

2)  I am getting an error when trying to simply get my loaded inputs.
When I do:

print "Gets here!"

alpha0 = inputs[0].PointData['alpha_0']

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 22, in <module>
  File "<string>", line 8, in RequestData
TypeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute '__getitem__'

I don't understand what is hppening here, can anyone help please?

Hi Craig,

Which version of ParaView are you using?

What file format are you loading?

Hi Berk,

Thanks for the response.  I see I'm at the fount.  So, I'm using paraview
4.1.0, and loading everything in from vtu files.  The basic python filter
I'm trying to get running in parallel is this below, for a basic
integration along a dimension in two of the loaded fields (one a scalar
alpha_0, the other a two dimensional vector sigma_0_0__sigma_0_1).

----------------
import numpy

alpha0 = inputs[0].PointData['alpha_0']
alpha1 = inputs[0].PointData['alpha_0']
sigma0 = inputs[0].PointData['sigma_0_0__sigma_0_1']

pdi = self.GetInputDataObject(0,0)
bg_field = 1
pdi = self.GetInputDataObject(0,0)
pdo = self.GetOutputDataObject(0)
numPoints = pdi.GetNumberOfPoints()
import time

ind=self.GetInput()
iin=ind.GetInformation()
timestep = time.clock()

dx = 100.0
dy = 100.0

for (j,alpha) in enumerate(alpha0):
    x1,y1,z1 = pdi.GetPoint(j)[:3]
    x2,y2,z2 = pdi.GetPoint(j+1)[:3]
    if abs(x2-x1) <= dx and abs(x2-x1)>0:
        dx = x2 - x1
    if abs(y2-y1) <= dy and abs(y2-y1)>1e-6:
        dy = y2 - y1

counter = 0
last_step = -1.0
prev_x = 0.0
efold = numpy.zeros(numPoints)
y_first = -1.0

for (j,alpha) in enumerate(alpha0):
    x,y,z = pdi.GetPoint(j)
    if x<380.0 and x>70.0 and y==0.0:
        y_first = []
        for (i,alpha_1) in enumerate(alpha1):
            x1,y1,z1 = pdi.GetPoint(i)

First things first, you need to upgrade to 4.2 :-) It has significant
improvements to the Python API and you are like to need them.

When running in parallel, if you want to restrict which ranks print out
information, you can do something like this:

import vtk
contr = vtk.vtkMultiProcessController.GetGlobalController()
rank = contr.GetLocalProcessId()

if id == 0:
  print 'hello'

You will likely need MPI methods here. See:

http://www.kitware.com/blog/home/post/716

The reason you are seeing the error is that one of the ranks does not have
any data. I can't remember from the top of my head if we automatically
distribute vtu files. Try applying the D3 filter and see what happens.

Best,

I am still busy with finding out which etensions are needed, and how I
can enable them.
THis opebnGL-world is a bit alien to me, so it will take some time.

Subject: [Paraview] Cannot add 3D cell to umesh
Message-ID: <543F2DCD.9030204@xs4all.nl>

Hello,

I'm wondering how I should add e.g. a 3D cell like a tri-prism
(a prism with identical triangles as base) or a skew variation of it
(triangles are not the same) to an (empty) unstructured grid.
The 3D cell itself is described by its points (vtkPoints) and its faces,
collected in a vtkCellArray.
Is this a cell of type VTK_POLYHEDRON?

Do I need to add such a cell face by face, or what?
There are quite a few methods in vtkUnstructuredGrid that promise to do
so or
something similar, but so far I did not have success (segfaults).

The methods I found from the documentation are:

vtkIdType     InsertNextCell (int type, vtkIdType npts, vtkIdType *pts)
vtkIdType     InsertNextCell (int type, vtkIdList *ptIds)

void     SetCells (int type, vtkCellArray *cells)
void     SetCells (int *types, vtkCellArray *cells)
void     SetCells (vtkUnsignedCharArray *cellTypes, vtkIdTypeArray
*cellLocations, vtkCellArray *cells)

int     InsertNextLinkedCell (int type, int npts, vtkIdType *pts)

I'm afraid I don't really appreciate the differences.
Any help is appreciated.

Kind Regards,
Bertwim

As a follow up on this it turns out my python plotting script had the 
following line:

from twisted.protocols.amp import AMP

It turns out twisted is only required for paraview web (which I am not 
using) so commented this out and it works fine. I am sure you can all 
rest easy now.

Subject: [Paraview] Bug? - ExtractedSelection is mapped between Extracted
	Blocks
Message-ID: <543FA5FB.9010303@virgin.net>

Hi,

I understand that objects in a vtk pipeline will be updated if something 
earlier changes, but I can see no use for this behaviour (and it's quite 
a pain to me ;). To replicate:

1) Load the can.ex2 example and apply the 'Extract Block' filter.
2) Navigate to the ExtractBlock/'Block indices' menu and switch on 
'Unnamed block ID 1' so you can see the semi-circular can object.
3) Click the 'Select Points On' rubber-band selection button and draw a 
rectangle of points on the can.
4) Click the 'Extract Selection' button.
5) Go back to the ExtractBlock/'Block indices' menu, switch off 'Unnamed 
block ID 1' and turn on 'Unnamed block ID 2'

You will see that the extracted selection is mapped to apparently 
arbitrary points in or on the second block (you may need to change 
opacity to see the mapped points). Other similar but strange behaviour 
occurs if you select across blocks and switch to view just one or a few 
of them.

I note that if I obtain the pqSelectionManager I can clear the 
selection, but as the docs say, the selection still exists somewhere in 
the vtk code. Is there a better way to control this action?

(Tested with ParaView 4.1 and Windows and Ubuntu, and 4.2 on Ubuntu.)

Thanks,
Richard

ps
I tried searching through the archives for block/selection issues and 
I'm a bit surprised not to find anything like this before.... though it 
may be related to issue raised by Robert Ainsworth ?? [so I've just cc'd 
this to him]

Subject: [Paraview] Labeling specific points in dataset
Message-ID: <CA+sJ3g6xgdLpWbz+ZyDr-nKqFjqnbkWgHW_U04tHqbSiGW23XQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Everyone,

I have a dataset of about 1000 or so points and I want to label say every
100'th point with the point id. I can use the DataLabelRepresentation if I
want to label every point, but as far as I can tell this cannot label only
certain points it is everything or nothing. I could also create a new
dataset with every 100th point in it and use that with the
DataLabelRepresentation but then the point ids would be wrong.

Any ideas or suggestions are welcome.

Cheers

Kit

Hi Kit,

If you can find a way to create a selection of the points, the selected points can be labeled. Is that feasible?

Andy

I appear to be suffering from a confusion of what the catalyst framework does - or how it is used ...

I had imagined that I?d run a simulation on N ranks, have catalyst bound to them and be able to do vis on those N ranks. But in fact, when I connect to a live simulation, I have to ?extract? results from them and then render them back on the client.

Is this the case or did I miss something?

The parallel image generation appears to work as advertised, but the images go off to disk and not to the renderwindow. Is there a way on configuring it so that I can see the actual rendering taking place in the renderview? I wanted to display the contents of a custom render plugin using cuda based rendering on many GPUs and be able to interact with it, but I am obviously missing something in my setup.

thanks

JB

Subject: Re: [Paraview] Catalyst question

Hi John,

This live capability is now available and recently has been cleaned up quite a bit. There are still a couple more small changes that are waiting a code review process before they go into the master branch. The user's guide needs an update for a bunch of new information (live, catalyst editions, zero-copy arrays) that's important for Catalyst. We're also doing some preliminary testing with a newly developed ADIOS writer for better IO performance as well.
Getting back to the live viz stuff, when you create a Catalyst Python script and export it using the wizard you'll have the option to enable live viz (it's the same wizard page as the screenshot output specification). Then, while your simulation is running use the Catalyst->Connect option to connect. There are two tests (pv.CatalystLiveSetBreakpoint and pvcs.CatalystLiveSetBreakpoint) that demonstrate the newly implemented live functionality which now includes the option to set a breakpoint in the simulation.
If you get a chance to try it out, let me know what you think.

Andy

Dear Catalyst people

I dragged out an old simulation demo I created some time ago and got it working with paraview/catalyst from git master branch - my plan was to test a live visualization of the simulation with the paraview GUI connected to the simulation. I had thought this capability was now possible, but I have not been following development closely and it looks like I was mistaken.

Is it possible to visualize the simulation live - rather than just generate images (which works fine). (I had a quick skim through the user manual, but didn?t see this feature mentioned).

Thanks

You can tell DataLabelRepresentation to label using any data array. By
adding an array such as "original ids" or something during the
extraction processes, you can tell the representation to use that
array for labeling instead. That's pretty much on extract-selection
filters work too.

Hi John,

You are correct that the rendering that's done by Catalyst to create images
is not directly available to the client. I hope to fix this in the not too
distant future. The idea being that you select which Catalyst view you want
to interact with and then it switches the view to that such that you can
update view options like camera angles, lookup tables, etc. as well as
output frequency and filename for that view when from Catalyst.

As for creating a live connection to a Catalyst enabled simulation, maybe
the thing you want is to use a live connection with pausing the simulation
to get to data at a specific point in the simulation. If this data is too
much to download to the client you can create a separate pvserver to
connect to Catalyst and then connect your client to that pvserver. I
haven't tried this but Utkarsh said that it was designed to work this way.

Does this sound like a reasonable way of doing what you want? Now that the
live functionality also has the ability to pause a simulation, it's
feasible that we could go the libsim route and have Catalyst act as server
for everything instead of downloading it to the client or separate server.
We just haven't had a lot of impetus for providing that use case yet so
we've focused on other stuff.

Regards,
Andy

Just to confirm Andy's answer, you can do the rendering on a separate
ParaView server (pvserver), which can be the same as the server you run the
simulation on. Catalyst will send extracts to this server which will render
them.
Only images will be send back to the client.

We show that use case at the end of our article.

Andy, Dan

Thank you both for clarifying this. I might give the catalyst->server->client version a go, but it seems like it might be too much trouble ...
I expect I?ll just use the solution we developed here at CSCS a couple of years ago where we just connect  the simulation to the pvservers and then connect the client to them. That way I won?t need to copy the data between processes again (there is already a copy because the simulation is writing to a shared memory buffer and the pvservers would read from that - not the same as the H5FDdsm stuff we developed, but very similar, and I can simply piggy back our live viz on top of that).

We wanted to do a live demo of GPU rendering on 1024 or so nodes at SC14 so it may be that using something I?m already familiar with will save me time as were getting close to Nov ...

On that note : It ought to be trivial to whip up a catalyst ?view? which captures the images from the internal renderwindow created by catalyst and have them displayed in the GUI so that the user can see the ?live? viz. Not sure how you?d pass the interactions back to handle mouse etc, but if the client can write to the camera objects via proxies then it should be possible ....  might try this myself if I have a moment spare.

thanks again

JB

Hi John,

I had imagined that I?d run a simulation on N ranks, have catalyst bound to them and be able to do vis on those N ranks. But in fact, when I connect to a live simulation, I have to ?extract? results from them and then render them back on the client.

Is this the case or did I miss something?

Just to confirm Andy's answer, you can do the rendering on a separate ParaView server (pvserver), which can be the same as the server you run the simulation on. Catalyst will send extracts to this server which will render them.

The parallel image generation appears to work as advertised, but the images go off to disk and not to the renderwindow. Is there a way on configuring it so that I can see the actual rendering taking place in the renderview? I wanted to display the contents of a custom render plugin using cuda based rendering on many GPUs and be able to interact with it, but I am obviously missing something in my setup.

thanks

Hi John,


This live capability is now available and recently has been cleaned up quite a bit. There are still a couple more small changes that are waiting a code review process before they go into the master branch. The user's guide needs an update for a bunch of new information (live, catalyst editions, zero-copy arrays) that's important for Catalyst. We're also doing some preliminary testing with a newly developed ADIOS writer for better IO performance as well.
Getting back to the live viz stuff, when you create a Catalyst Python script and export it using the wizard you'll have the option to enable live viz (it's the same wizard page as the screenshot output specification). Then, while your simulation is running use the Catalyst->Connect option to connect. There are two tests (pv.CatalystLiveSetBreakpoint and pvcs.CatalystLiveSetBreakpoint) that demonstrate the newly implemented live functionality which now includes the option to set a breakpoint in the simulation.
If you get a chance to try it out, let me know what you think.

Hi John,

I'll be at SC14 and I'd be interested in seeing your demo. Are the details
of when and where ready yet?

Hey y'all -

Anyone able to get the OpenGL2 backend to build?   If I set VTK_RENDERING_BACKEND to OpenGL2, I get:

CMake Error at VTK/Rendering/OpenGL/CMakeLists.txt:3 (message):
   vtkRenderingOpenGL cannot be built with vtkRenderingOpenGL2, please disable
   one of them.

And I can't figure out how to get past it.

Greg,

This isn't ready for testing yet. There are still code changes that need to
go into ParaView before folks can start building with OpenGL2 backend
support.

Subject: [Paraview] Bug? - ExtractedSelection is mapped between
	Extracted Blocks
In-Reply-To: <543FA5FB.9010303@virgin.net>
References: <543FA5FB.9010303@virgin.net>

Try unchecking the "Purne Output" checkbox on the "Extract Block"
filter's Property panel. The problem is that "Prune Output" changes
the structure of the multiblock. Hence the selection defined in (3)
resolves differently after (5).

Hi Bertwim,

The problem you're experiencing is not an issue of missing extensions, 
but rather a bug in ATI's driver. Projected tetrahedra is disabled when 
an ATI device is detected to avoid that bug(ParaView will hang). However 
it's not a big deal. because you can use the "Bunyk raycast" algrothim 
instead. After your data is on screen scroll to the bottom of the 
properties panel and look for the field "Select mapper", set that to 
"Bunyk ray cast", then change the representation to "volume".

At the CSCS booth, we will have a display of the simulation running on our cray. Hopefully it?ll be running on and off for a significant part of the week and we wanted to display the live results and allow interaction with the simulation by random passers by (with supervision!) so with luck, it?ll be available any time you want to see. I?ll be doing my duty and manning the booth in between the presentations at the conf etc.
I think I?ll also be doing a brief guest slot on the kitware booth, but I don?t yet know the time etc.
yours
JB

Hello,

We would like to use the xdmf3 exporter in ParaView. Dave mentioned to add in the cmake flags  to ParaView

-DModule_vtkIOXdmf3:BOOL=ON

But for the superbuild  process

cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=${HOME}/pv-test/${version}_osmesa -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DParaView_FROM_GIT=OFF -DParaView_URL=/mnt/lustre/people/ssu/build/paraview/dl/ParaView-v4.2.0-source-xdmf3.tar.gz -DENABLE_boost=ON -DENABLE_cgns=OFF -DENABLE_ffmpeg=ON -DENABLE_fontconfig=ON -DENABLE_freetype=ON -DENABLE_hdf5=ON -DENABLE_libxml2=ON -DENABLE_matplotlib=ON -DENABLE_mesa=OFF -DENABLE_mpi=ON -DENABLE_numpy=ON -DENABLE_osmesa=ON -DENABLE_paraview=ON -DENABLE_png=ON -DENABLE_python=ON -DENABLE_qhull=ON -DENABLE_qt=OFF -DENABLE_silo=ON -DENABLE_szip=ON -DENABLE_visitbridge=ON -DMPI_CXX_LIBRARIES:STRING="/opt/cray/mpt/5.3.5/xt/seastar/mpich2-gnu/46/lib/libmpichcxx.so" -DMPI_C_LIBRARIES:STRING="/opt/cray/mpt/5.3.5/xt/seastar/mpich2-gnu/46/lib/libmpich.so" -DMPI_LIBRARY:FILEPATH="/opt/cray/mpt/5.3.5/xt/seastar/mpich2-gnu/46/lib/libmpichcxx.so" -DMPI_CXX_INCLUDE_PATH:STRING="/opt/cray/mpt/5.3.5/xt/seastar/mpich2-gnu/46/include/" -DMPI_C_INCLUDE_PATH:STRING="/opt/cray/mpt/5.3.5/xt/seastar/mpich2-gnu/46/include/" -DUSE_SYSTEM_mpi=ON -DUSE_SYSTEM_python=OFF -DUSE_SYSTEM_zlib=OFF -DModule_vtkIOXdmf3:BOOL=ON -DBoost_NO_BOOST_CMAKE:BOOL=ON ../ParaViewSuperbuild_4.2.0

cmake gave warning

CMake Warning:
  Manually-specified variables were not used by the project:

    Boost_NO_BOOST_CMAKE
    Module_vtkIOXdmf3

How do I go around that?

Any help is much appreciated.

The options need to be passed to the ParaView build itself, not the
superbuild. There's a cache option in the superbuild named
PV_EXTRA_CMAKE_ARGS which should contain
"-DBoost_NO_BOOST_CMAKE:BOOL=ON -DModule_vtkIOXdmf3:BOOL=ON" to pass it
to the ParaView build properly.

Try deleting your configuration files?  I would be surprised if this is the issue, since you tried multiple versions.  http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView_Settings_Files.   Only other thing I can think of is you have a corrupt video driver?

Hi Ben,

Thanks for your help. How do I pass both arguments to ParaView build with  PV_EXTRA_CMAKE_ARGS?

When I do -DPV_EXTRA_CMAKE_ARGS separately, cmake didn't like it.
-DPV_EXTRA_CMAKE_ARGS="-DModule_vtkIOXdmf3:BOOL=ON" -DPV_EXTRA_CMAKE_ARGS="-DBoost_NO_BOOST_CMAKE:BOOL=ON"

I am getting
CMake Warning:
  Manually-specified variables were not used by the project:

    PV_EXTRA_CMAKE_ARGS=-DBoost_NO_BOOST_CMAKE

When I do both argument in the same -DPV_EXTRA_CMAKE_ARGS, cmake also didn't like it.
-DPV_EXTRA_CMAKE_ARGS="-DModule_vtkIOXdmf3:BOOL=ON -DBoost_NO_BOOST_CMAKE:BOOL=ON" 

I am getting 
CMake Warning:
  Manually-specified variables were not used by the project:

    PV_EXTRA_CMAKE_ARGS=-DModule_vtkIOXdmf3


But if I just do one of the argument, 
-DPV_EXTRA_CMAKE_ARGS="-DModule_vtkIOXdmf3:BOOL=ON"

it worked.

Please see below...

thanks
-simon

The options need to be passed to the ParaView build itself, not the
superbuild. There's a cache option in the superbuild named
PV_EXTRA_CMAKE_ARGS which should contain
"-DBoost_NO_BOOST_CMAKE:BOOL=ON -DModule_vtkIOXdmf3:BOOL=ON" to pass it
to the ParaView build properly.

Weird. It looks like the argument is being split at the colon? Playing
around with it a bit, it seems it's the shell's doing. Put the quotes
around the entire argument, not after the equals sign.

Subject: [Paraview] Questions on vector images output
Message-ID: <CA+qRWnuHASWtqddCFfqZW4ZaNnEPpF+V1V8bG_LcJ95QhFqL6A@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I have two questions related to the vector images output from ParaView for
3D. I use ParaView 4.1.0 32-bit on Ubuntu.

1. I've read here (http://www.kitware.com/blog/home/post/508) in the
discussion after the post that if the "colors are generated from point/cell
attributes", "the exporter should be able to handle it once 'Rasterize 3D
geometry' turned off". Otherwise "you may end up with your exported object
appearing grey/colorless". That's exactly what happens in my case. However
my 3D picture is based on a rectangular grid with values of the computed
field defined at the vertices of the grid. I understand that for
visualization ParaView convert the rectangles to triangles first (and it's
clearly seen from the grey/colorless image I have), therefore I'm wondering
if it'll help if I replace rectangular mesh to triangular from my side.

2. The second question is why the labels of the axis have some
triangulation inside them (here is a picture
http://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-0jjlhN_6HyWkR1bWoxc3dVazA/view?usp=sharing).
Is it GL2PS feature? How can I make them look like labels on colour bar?

Thank you,
Mikhail

Hi Mikhail,

1) The triangulation artifacts you're seeing are likely due to antialiasing
in the viewer. Turning AA off (or using a different viewer) should make the
gaps between the triangles disappear and the surface should appear smooth
again.

2) The axis labels are 3D objects with rotations away from the plane of the
image, while the scalar bar labels are in the plane of the image. This
means that the scalar bar labels can be inserted as actual text (i.e. tell
the viewer to draw the string "interior_bf_0"), but the axis labels have to
be drawn as bezier curves (i.e. tells the viewer to draw the shape of the
text) since the output image formats can't embed arbitrarily oriented text.
To fix the issue with the gaps, it looks like viewer antialiasing is the
likely culprit again.

Hope this helps,
Dave

Hi Dave,

Thank you for the reply. Switching from evince viewer to acroread did 
resolve this issue.

Ben,

I ran cmake with

-DPV_EXTRA_CMAKE_ARGS:STRING="-DModule_vtkIOXdmf3:BOOL=ON -DBoost_NO_BOOST_CMAKE:BOOL=ON"

and check it with ccmake. Looks like -DModule_vtkIOXdmf3:BOOL=ON -DBoost_NO_BOOST_CMAKE:BOOL=ON made it into the variable PV_EXTRA_CMAKE_ARGS

It appears :STRING does the trick.

I am running the compile now. Hopefully that does the trick.

thanks
-simon

Yep. This is a CMake parsing bug; the regular expression for this is too
greedy (it allows '=' in the variable name). Compare:

> -DPV_EXTRA_CMAKE_ARGS=-DModule_vtkIOXdmf3:BOOL=ON -DBoost_NO_BOOST_CMAKE:BOOL=ON
    |-------------------------------------| |--| |-------------------------------|
                variable                    type            value

versus:

> -DPV_EXTRA_CMAKE_ARGS:STRING=-DModule_vtkIOXdmf3:BOOL=ON -DBoost_NO_BOOST_CMAKE:BOOL=ON
    |-----------------| |----| |--------------------------------------------------------|
          variable       type                        value

this works:

> -DSOME_PATH=C:/path/to/file
    |-------| |-------------|
    variable       value

because paths with '=' are very rare:

> -DSOME_PATH=C:/path/to/file/with/=/sign
    |---------| |-----------------| |---|
      variable         type         value

Ben,

Unfortunately, when I checked the CMakeCache.txt in the directory paraview/src/paraview-build after the cmake ran, I am still finding

//Request building vtkIOXdmf3
Module_vtkIOXdmf3:BOOL=OFF

and Boost_NO_BOOST_CMAKE is none existence in the  CMakeCache.txt

I even tried both 
-DPV_EXTRA_CMAKE_ARGS:STRING="-DModule_vtkIOXdmf3:BOOL=ON -DBoost_NO_BOOST_CMAKE:BOOL=ON"
and 
-DPV_EXTRA_CMAKE_ARGS:STRING="Module_vtkIOXdmf3:BOOL=ON Boost_NO_BOOST_CMAKE:BOOL=ON"

thoughts?

thanks
-simon

Yep. This is a CMake parsing bug; the regular expression for this is too
greedy (it allows '=' in the variable name). Compare:

> -DPV_EXTRA_CMAKE_ARGS=-DModule_vtkIOXdmf3:BOOL=ON -DBoost_NO_BOOST_CMAKE:BOOL=ON
    |-------------------------------------| |--| |-------------------------------|
                variable                    type            value

versus:

> -DPV_EXTRA_CMAKE_ARGS:STRING=-DModule_vtkIOXdmf3:BOOL=ON -DBoost_NO_BOOST_CMAKE:BOOL=ON
    |-----------------| |----| |--------------------------------------------------------|
          variable       type                        value

this works:

> -DSOME_PATH=C:/path/to/file
    |-------| |-------------|
    variable       value

because paths with '=' are very rare:

    |---------| |-----------------| |---|
      variable         type         value

Subject: [Paraview] [ANN] New 4.2.0 Release Binary for OS X 10.6 (Snow
	Leopard)
Message-ID: <20141021190627.GA3913@megas.kitwarein.com>

Hi all,

We've tracked down the error with the Snow Leopard builds of ParaView
4.2.0 and new binaries have been uploaded to the website available
through the normal download page.

To ensure you have the new binary, the md5sum of the new dmg file is:

    b1289277d12563321212ed83b70c2f20

The cause of the issue was that the machine building the binaries is a
newer OS X install which contains AVFoundation. This is detected and
linked to by FFmpeg automatically because it never received the proper
--sysroot flag for 10.6. FFmpeg now receives the proper CFLAGS and
LDFLAGS in the superbuild (which should be receiving a new tag in the
next day or two).

Thanks,

--Ben

Thanks David/Utkarsh,

In the end the proceedure I went for to construct the labels was.

1- Use GenerateScalarIds filter to create a data array with the point IDs
2- Use MaskPoints filter to decimate the array
3- Use the DataLabel representation with the decimated array to show and 
the original IDs to draw the labels.

Thanks for you help on this.

The subject line of this email asks how to extract a slice in a z=constant plane. That can easily be done with the slice filter with the normal set to 0,0,1.

The text of this email asks a completely different question, extracting the exterior boundary of an unstructured mesh. This is done with the Extract Surface filter. If your data is distributed with MPI and does not have ghost cells (which is common in unstructured data files) it is possible that Extract Surface will also extract some interior surfaces at the boundary of the geometry partitions. If this is a problem, you can first use the D3 filter to generate ghost cells and then run the Extract Surface filter.

Subject: [Paraview] Filter to keep points, dropping topology
Message-ID: <5447BD0B.50509@xs4all.nl>

Hello,

I need a filter that only keeps the 3D points of a certain source (e.g.
coming from  an stl file).
The topology of the data set may go.

I thought that the following filter, only passing through the pointdata,
would do the job,
but that appears not to be the case (no points after the filter!)
What's going wrong and how should I change the filter?

Kind Regards,
Bertwim

================

int FilterPoints::RequestData( vtkInformation*,
                                             vtkInformationVector**
inputVector,
                                             vtkInformationVector*
outputVector)
{
   // Get the input and output data objects.
   vtkDataSet* input = vtkDataSet::GetData( inputVector[0] );
   vtkDataSet* output = vtkDataSet::GetData( outputVector );

   // output->CopyStructure( input );
   output->GetPointData()->PassData( input->GetPointData() );
  
   return 1;
}

Output->SetPoints(input->GetPoints());

Or

Output->CopyStructure(input);
Output->SetCells(NULL)

Then copy point field data etc

don't forget to add vertex type cells, or you will not be able to see 
the points,  and that it's going to be more complicated if you're 
starting from data types that have implicit points.

Subject: [Paraview] artifacts in image data volume rendering
Message-ID: <5447C6B9.4020902@gmail.com>

Hi, I'm encountering what look like process boundaries in image data 
volume rendering. This is view dependent, only certain camera locations 
reveal the issue. In examples below these are "horizontal line" like 
artifacts. This data is large, and I have not been able to successfully 
volume render after tetrahedralizing it. I'm not sure if it's just 
insanely slow or there's a deadlock. My attempts have been up to 1024 
procs with 8 per node (8 GB per proc), That's about the smallest I can 
to get enough ram to do the terahedralization, about 50% of the ram is 
used after the tetrahedralization.  Does anyone know if the fixed point 
vr algorithm is parallel aware, would adding ghost zones to the image 
data help??

The compiler tells me:
error: ?class vtkDataSet? has no member named ?SetPoints?

Likewise, SetCells() is also not a member function of vtkDataSet.

Indeed, according to the doc, there is no such function.


Any idea?

Are you saying that one cannot have just points?

In my case, I want to  snap the points to a structured grid,
but haven't done that yet, as I wanted to see the
points first, and do the snapping as a next step.
So that is not a good idea? I need to do it all in one go?

Bertwim

SetPoints is present in vtkDataSets that are subclasses of vtkPointSet

You said you didn?t want any topology, so I didn?t think you wanted vertex
cells.

vtkSmartPointer<vtkCellArray> vertices =
vtkSmartPointer<vtkCellArray>::New();
    vtkIdType *cells = vertices->WritePointer(Nt, 2*Nt);
    for (vtkIdType i=0; i<Nt; ++i)
      {
      cells[2*i] = 1;
      cells[2*i+1] = i;
      }
    output->SetVerts(vertices);
    }

you can have just points, they'll be ignored during rendering without 
vertex type cells.

Ah, I found it. It is the other way around:   vtkPointSet is a subclass
of vtkDataSet.
The former has SetPoints, the latter has not.
So I subclassed my filter class from vtkPointSet instead of vtkDataSet,
and it now it works.


Thanks.

Subject: [Paraview] Feature request - Need more detailed control of
 generating nodal quantities from element results
Message-ID: <6652ad5b31d448968120dde0977cff7e@ES05AMSNLNT.srn.sandia.gov>

A question from a user.  I believe that answer is correct to the first bullet, and the answer is no to the second bullet?


1 - Averaging a nodal result from surrounding elements is OK as long as the node is within a homogenous body.  This process is not correct for nodes on the boundary between two different materials.
2 - Is there a process to extrapolate element integration point quantities (stresses, strains) to nodes for elements with non-linear shape functions?


Thanks,

Alan

Hi Aashish,

Great! I've been seeing this bug for a long time going back at least to 
ParaView 3.8. It's image data, and I have used the ray cast only option 
in ParaView which in the end (via vtk smart volume mapper) corresponds 
to the vtk fixed point volume mapper. For this run I used 256 procs, I 
can share the data and a state file if it would help.

Subject: [Paraview]  Segmentation Fault when using the vtkPVDReader
Message-ID: <54490222.9000809@simscale.de>

Hello all,

I am attempting to write some code in c++ which uses the vtkPVDReader from the paraview library to read a series of vtm files. However I am encountering some
problems and I am not sure whether there is something I am missing or whether this could be a bug.

I am trying to use the reader in the following manner:
My Code:
	vtkSmartPointer <vtkPVDReader> pReader = vtkPVDReader::New();
	pReader->SetForceOutputTypeToMultiBlock(1);
	pReader->SetFileName("/some/fileName.pvd");
	pReader->Update();
	vtkMultiBlockDataSet* pMultiBlockDataSet->DeepCopy(vtkMultiBlockDataSet::SafeDownCast(pReader->GetOutputDataObject(0)));

Error:
	The error occurs at Update() with the following result:
	ERROR: In /misc/dn47/SALOME/PRODUCTS/7x/opt/Ubuntu.13.10.64/7.4.0/tmp/ParaView-4.1.0_SRC/ParaViewCore/VTKExtensions/Default
	/vtkXMLCollectionReader.cxx, line 316
	vtkPVDReader (0x224d9e0): Error creating "vtkXMLMultiBlockDataReader" using vtkPVInstantiator.
	Segmentation fault

Possible error Source
The code concerning line 316 from vtkXMLCollectionReader.cxx is:

      // Use the instantiator to create the reader.
      vtkObject* o = vtkPVInstantiator::CreateInstance(rname);
      vtkXMLReader* reader = vtkXMLReader::SafeDownCast(o);
      this->Internal->Readers[index] = reader;
      if(reader)
        {
        reader->Delete();
        }
      else
        {
        // The class was not registered with the instantiator.
        vtkErrorMacro("Error creating \"" << rname
                      << "\" using vtkPVInstantiator.");
        if(o)
          {
          o->Delete();
          }
        }
      }

I have isolated the following lines and tested them independently:
      vtkObject* o = vtkPVInstantiator::CreateInstance(rname);
      vtkXMLReader* reader = vtkXMLReader::SafeDownCast(o);

The pointer "vtkObject* o" is NULL regardless of the class name I pass to instantiate, and I can imagine something like that happening in the library, too and
causing the segmentation fault, when calling a SafeDownCast(o) (which is NULL).


Any suggestions on how to deal with this problem or if you would be so kind to point me to an example for an alternative solution (Could be vtkFileSeriesReader,
but this fails, as well in my case) would be appreciated.

Kind Regards,
Bogdan

P.S.: Using the PVDReader from python code works flawlessly, which is also quite confusing, as to why it would fail in the C++ code.

Hi Bogdan,

here are some issue in your code:

vtkSmartPointer <vtkPVDReader> pReader = vtkPVDReader::New(); // <== Memory
LEAK
// Should be either
// vtkNew<vtkPVDReader> pReader;
// vtkSmartPointer<vtkPVDReader> pReader =
vtkSmartPointer<vtkPVDReader>::New()

Then here on a "NULL" object you try to call a method.

vtkMultiBlockDataSet* pMultiBlockDataSet->DeepCopy(vtkMultiBlockDataSet::
SafeDownCast(pReader->GetOutputDataObject(0)));

Should be something like that:

vtkNew< vtkMultiBlockDataSet > pMultiBlockDataSet;
pMultiBlockDataSet->DeepCopy(vtkMultiBlockDataSet::SafeDownCast(pReader->
GetOutputDataObject(0)));

Then you might have some other issue where pReader output being empty/null,
but for that I don't know.

Are you managing your project with CMake? Did you include the necessary
file with the proper dependency declaration. This seems to be related to
the factory not being properly initialized. You can search the mailing
list, Marcus did answer several questions about that.

Hi Alan,

You are correct (although (1) is somewhat unclear - are we talking about
Exodus files that have different element sets here?).

I would also recommend this document:
http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/images/7/78/VTK-Quadrature-Point-Design-Doc.pdf
which explains the current integration (gauss) point support. It doesn't do
what he wants but it's worth a read.

Best,
-berk

Subject: [Paraview] ScalarOpacityFunction property not set when saving
	python state
Message-ID: <CAPiw4fBZ_kG-8qjJE_c3=0-ygch82wJr2ki6NAxKsAnH=ir2fg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

   Has anyone else noticed this recently?  At the bottom of this email is
an example of some state I just saved, which seems to be missing the
following line:

magnitudeDisplay.ScalarOpactiyFunction = splatterValuesPWF

   If this is a bug, I can enter a bug report.

Cheers,

Subject: [Paraview] Segmentation Fault when using the vtkPVDReader

Hi Seb,

Thanks for the quick reply. Yes the project is managed with CMake. I have not however been able to find the relevant posts by Marcus (in the users list). Is
that in the users or developers mailing list?

It does sound like it could be a problem with some initialization, as you can see below.

One short update, it looks like setting ForceMultiBlockDataSet Output with:
pReader->SetForceOutputTypeToMultiBlock(1);
leads to the segmentation fault at Update() (The deepcopy is never reached). With or without setting the previous line, the error
vtkPVDReader (0x1cb49e0): Error creating "vtkXMLMultiBlockDataReader" using vtkPVInstantiator.

The code looks like this now:
	vtkSmartPointer < vtkPVDReader > pReader = vtkSmartPointer < vtkPVDReader >::New();
	pReader->SetFileName("/some/file.pvd");
	pReader->Update(); (where the error is triggered)

Kind Regards,
Bogdan

Hi Alan,

You are correct (although (1) is somewhat unclear - are we talking about Exodus files that have different element sets here?).

I would also recommend this document: http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/images/7/78/VTK-Quadrature-Point-Design-Doc.pdf which explains the current integration (gauss) point support. It doesn't do what he wants but it's worth a read.

1 - Averaging a nodal result from surrounding elements is OK as long as the node is within a homogenous body.  This process is not correct for nodes on the boundary between two different materials.
2 - Is there a process to extrapolate element integration point quantities (stresses, strains) to nodes for elements with non-linear shape functions?


Thanks,

Alan

Certainly. I should mention, I am using a pre-compiled version of Paraview 4.1 bundled with Salome (Ubuntu package).

Here it is (using pReader->SetForceOutputTypeToMultiBlock(1)):

Subject: [Paraview] loading multiple pvd files - create an xml vtp file that
 will load all the vtp files
Message-ID: <F02E4EC9F4B4BA4189BBDC8BF3B2AD8225E7EB41@umechpaxb.easf.csd.disa.mil>

Hello,

Please see below for a list of file that I write to vtp format in parallel. So the number of files I get is dependent on how many processes I used to write the data out. When loading the pieces,

Material-volume-fraction---1_Merged_000.vtp ..... Material-volume-fraction---1_Merged_030.vtp

ParaView loader is intelligent enough to group the files into 1 file group that I can click to load them.

However, in some cases the file grouping are not available to me and I end up having to click on all the files pieces to load the whole visualization piece that I am interested in. From the

Material-volume-fraction---1_Merged_000.vtp xml format, I can see that it is loading all the pieces in

files Material-volume-fraction---1_Merged_000_0.vtp  .. Material-volume-fraction---1_Merged_000_3.vtp

how can I write a Material-volume-fraction---1_Merged.vtp file that has all the pieces spread out in the files

Material-volume-fraction---1_Merged_000.vtp ..... Material-volume-fraction---1_Merged_030.vtp ?

Are there utility that I can use to generate the vtp xml file? or I have to code it up by hand?

Any help is much appreciated

thanks
-simon

Subject: [Paraview] accessing parallel xdmf3 writer
Message-ID: <F02E4EC9F4B4BA4189BBDC8BF3B2AD8225E7EB59@umechpaxb.easf.csd.disa.mil>

Hello,

I used the python script below to convert pvd format into xmf file with xdmf3 enable ParaView that I compiled. The writer is working if I run it in serial (pvbatch pvd_to_xmf.py pvd/mvf2.pvd)
.
How do I access to xmf parallel writer?  I am getting the following error

vtkSMWriterFactory (0x66c5d0): No matching writer found for extension: xmf

if I run the script with

aprun -n 12 pvbatch pvd_to_xmf.py pvd/mvf2.pvd


thank you in advanced for your help.

thanks
-simon

================ pvbatch pvd_to_xmf.py ==========
#### import the simple module from the paraview
import sys
try: paraview.simple
except: from paraview.simple import *

#### get the filename from command line
fileName = str(sys.argv[1])

print "Reading " + fileName
#### reading pvd file
mvfpvd = PVDReader(FileName=fileName)

#### create output file name
(prefix, sep, suffix) = fileName.rpartition('.')
ofileName = prefix + '.xmf'

print "Writing xmf output file to " + ofileName

#### create output file
SaveData(ofileName, proxy=mvfpvd, WriteAllTimeSteps=1)

Utkarsh,

I have been thinking and just want to check with you on this. If

pvbatch sample.py

is running, will that also test the ParaView binary we produced has a working 
python within the ParaView? What about checking and see if numpy is available 
for the ParaView binary produced? I even tried to turn off the numpy library 
(in the superbuild compile using the cmake flag -DENABLE_numpy=OFF) but the 
compilation process compiled numpy nevertheless. Do I have to include 
statement like

import numpy

to test if numpy or other python packages were properly compiled and available 
within ParaView?

Thanks
-simon

Simon,

Yup, that'd be a perfect test (attached).

You should run it with pvbatch.

Hi Bogdan,

You are writing a stand alone C++ app right? Are you setting up to run 
the composite data pipeline as in the following example?

100   vtkCompositeDataPipeline* cexec=vtkCompositeDataPipeline::New();
101   vtkAlgorithm::SetDefaultExecutivePrototype(cexec);
102   cexec->Delete();

Subject: [Paraview] PointSprite_Plugin not displaying textures on ParaView
	4.2.0 Mac OSX 10.10
Message-ID: <C3690D8B-87EA-464F-8905-D41102252A47@gmail.com>

Hi, 

I believe this is a bug:
The PointSprite_Plugin with ParaView 4.2.0  does not display textures  (same textures that  ParaView 4.1.0 can display on same machine with OS X 10.10. .) 
The texture seems to be loaded but it is not displayed. 

I used the release from this link:
http://www.paraview.org/paraview-downloads/download.php?submit=Download&version=v4.2&type=binary&os=osx&downloadFile=ParaView-4.2.0-Darwin-64bit.dmg 

Same behavior with ParaView built on the same machine from the ParaView 4.2.0 sources. 


Thanks, 
Matei

Message-ID: <000901cff031$55c8f210$015ad630$@gmail.com>



Hello everyone, I have object like in the picture above, it is created from
x,y,z points that are loaded from excel.

I need to create a body with rigid surface, I have used Delaunay 3D filter
and the result is good but not perfect. 

 



 

The problem is with this white linse and also at some places there are holes
in surface. Is there any way how to make this surface smoother ?? I have
tried to change Delaunay parameters but this is the best I was able to
obtain. Do you have any suggestions how to make it better ? 

 

S pozdravom/Best regards

 

Peter Dvor??k

Subject: [Paraview] pipeline??
Message-ID: <544BDEF8.8000104@xs4all.nl>

Hello,

How can I accomplish the following?

I have created a number of source objects (some are read
from file, e.g. an stl file), some are from other Sources.
On each of these segments in the pipeline browser
I can apply a filter that I have written, by selecting
it and applying my filter. Works ok.

But how can I apply this filter to all of them in one go?
 Initially, I thought that applying the filter to the last element
in the pipeline would be enough, it is a pipeline after all,
but that is not the case.

Do i need to specify somehow in my <filter>::DataRequest
method that it needs to get its input from all segemnts in
the pipe? But how does that work?

This is what I have in this routine now:
   // Get the input data object
   vtkPolyData* input = vtkPolyData::GetData( inputVector[0] ); assert(
input );

Kind Regards,
Bertwim

There isn't any direct mechanism for it. ParaView currently only has two
options: head light, or the "light kit" which comes with a fixed set of
lights.

Matei,

I was indeed able to reproduce the issue. I've reported a bug [1].
We'll track it down soon.

Simon,

No. For that, you can run paraview executable and have it run the
script on launch instead:

     paraview --script=sample.py

Yes, you should do something like the following:

     import numpy
     print numpy.version.version

Same is true for other packages like matplotlib. The API to check the
version will of course be different with each.

The only component in the ParaView superbuild that depends directly on
numpy is matplotlib. Is that enabled? If so, it will automatically
enable numpy as well. You'll need to turn both off  to disable numpy
entirely from the build.

easy question, but somehow i failed to google it.

i have (4.2.0):
- multiblock .vtm data
- applied "ExtractBlock" filter to get the block containing some lines
- the lines have a scalar attribute

now i want to only display those lines which have attribute==1, for example.

what filter do i have to apply?

thanks

thank you, that works for now.

but: the attribute contains unsigned ints (flags).

assuming {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}, what if i'd like  to only display 
discontinuous subsets, e.g. lines with {1,4,7} flags?

thanks

The visualization pipeline does not have to be a single linear pipeline. You can have multiple pipelines that can fan in and fan out. When you load multiple data sets, you are actually creating several short independent pipelines. This fan in and fan out of pipelines is explained several places including the ParaView tutorial. 

To answer your question, simply use the group datasets filter. It is available in the common filters toolbar. It can accept several inputs. Group all of your files together and then add filters to the group datasets filter.

In ParaView 4.2, these controls, as well as everything else in the view properties dialog, have moved to the properties panel. Type light in the search bar at the to of the properties panel and you'll see a button to edit the lights.

Hi Ken,

Thanks for your answer. I found and tried the filter you mentioned and
it worked.
Despite my reading  I don't know how many pages on paraview/vtk doc I
read, but I missed that
multiple pipeline picture, so thanks for pointing me to it.
Remains to find out how to do that programmatically.
Regards,
Bertwim

Hi,
 Managed to get a "working version of Paraview-4.2.0.1" on our GPU cluster but when I try to run the 
parallelSphere.py script on more than one node it just hangs.  Work like it is supposed to up to 12 cores on a single node.  I am still trying work out if I a running on the GPU "tesla- C2070).  

Here is the list of cake configurations

IBS_TOOL_CONFIGURE='-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
-DParaView_FROM_GIT=OFF \
-DParaView_URL=$MYGROUP/vis/src/ParaView-v4.2.0-source.tar.gz \
-DENABLE_boost=ON \
-DENABLE_cgns=OFF \

-DENABLE_matplotlib=ON \
-DENABLE_mesa=OFF \
-DENABLE_mpi=ON \
-DENABLE_numpy=ON \
-DENABLE_osmesa=OFF \
-DENABLE_paraview=ON \
-DENABLE_png=ON \
-DENABLE_python=ON \
-DENABLE_qhull=ON \
-DENABLE_qt=ON \
-DENABLE_silo=ON \
-DENABLE_szip=ON \
-DENABLE_visitbridge=ON \
-DMPI_CXX_LIBRARIES:STRING="$MPI_HOME/lib/libmpi_cxx.so" \
-DMPI_C_LIBRARIES:STRING="$MPI_HOME/lib/libmpi.so" \
-DMPI_LIBRARY:FILEPATH="$MPI_HOME/lib/libmpi_cxx.so" \
-DMPI_CXX_INCLUDE_PATH:STRING="$MPI_HOME/include" \
-DMPI_C_INCLUDE_PATH:STRING="$MPI_HOME/include" \
-DUSE_SYSTEM_mpi=ON \
-DUSE_SYSTEM_python=OFF \
-DUSE_SYSTEM_qt=OFF \
-DUSE_SYSTEM_zlib=OFF '

The goal is to be able to support batch rendering on the whole cluster ~96 nodes.

Also do I need set another environment variable in my Paraview module to make the Xlib
warning go away?

[cbording at f100 Paraview]$ mpirun -n 12 pvbatch --use-offscreen-rendering parallelSphere.py
Xlib:  extension "NV-GLX" missing on display "localhost:50.0".
Xlib:  extension "NV-GLX" missing on display "localhost:50.0".

Xlib:  extension "NV-GLX" missing on display "localhost:50.0".
Xlib:  extension "NV-GLX" missing on display "localhost:50.0".

Is this related to my not being able to run across multiple nodes?

Hi Peter,

Does every profile have the same number of points?
If so, I would generate the connectivity myself and generate
a grid with quads. Another option could be to try to do the
Delaunay triangulation segment by segment (so two profiles
at a time). I am no expert whatsoever, but I think the problem
with Delauny is that is just sees a cloud of points to operate on.
In your case, there is a clear structure in the points (they are
located on section profiles). If you can use this underlying
structure I believe you will get a better result.

Marco

Hi Burlen,

Yes, it is a stand-alone C++ application, which makes use of VTK and Paraview as libraries, linking against them and calling functionality to interpret the data.
I am not setting up any pipeline (as of now). Is this from the TestExodusTime or TestTemporalFractal examples. I will try adding this.

Currently I need to read and traverse the dataset without adding any filters or processing the data. I it still needed to create a pipeline in this case?

Kind regards,
Bogdan

Dear Utkarsh,
Dear Matei

I am writing you because of the bug detected in the point sprite plugin:

[1]http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=15078


I am currently working on my own version of the point sprite plugin and 
also detected it.
Comparing source code of version 4.1 with 4.2 I guess I found the problem.

in the source file
source\Plugins\PointSprite\ParaViewPlugin\pqPointSpriteControls.cxx

after

line 261

the following command is missing

this->Internals->Links.addPropertyLink(this->Internals->RenderMode,
         "currentText", SIGNAL(currentIndexChanged(int)),
         this->Internals->RepresentationProxy, prop);


Hope this helps

Best regards,


Florian

Florian,

Fantastic! I am quite sure that's indeed the issue. I'll track it down
once I get to work later today.

Utkarsh,

thank you for your explanations. So, 

paraview --script=sample.py 
this will test to see if the python within ParaView

pvpython sample.py
pvbatch sample.py

than what will the above two tests show? If paraview --script=sample.py  test is a successful test, can we also assume that  pvpython and pvbatch test will also work?

So for individual python packages, I will need to do the import test for all the packages I want to test in the script right? Yes I have matplotlib enabled and that's why numpy is still there when I turn it off. Thanks...

thanks again for your help
-simon

Simon,

No. For that, you can run paraview executable and have it run the
script on launch instead:

     paraview --script=sample.py

> What about checking and see if numpy is available
> for the ParaView binary produced?

Yes, you should do something like the following:

     import numpy
     print numpy.version.version

Same is true for other packages like matplotlib. The API to check the
version will of course be different with each.

The only component in the ParaView superbuild that depends directly on
numpy is matplotlib. Is that enabled? If so, it will automatically
enable numpy as well. You'll need to turn both off  to disable numpy
entirely from the build.

Simon,

Although, explicit pvpython/pvbatch test isn't necessary, it's worth
doing it since sometimes the paths to locate ParaView's Python modules
can get messed up between different executables.

> So for individual python packages, I will need to do the import test for all the packages I want to test in the script right?

Yes, ideally.

Hi Christopher,

I can't help you with the superbuild, but I can show you how to build PV 
on the XC30. here's the script 
<https://github.com/burlen/pvserver-configs/blob/master/servers/edison/builds/config-pv-mesa.sh> 
I used to build ParaView 4.2 with PrgEnv-gnu/5.2.25 on our XC30

You'll see a bunch of paths that need to be set specific to the version 
of PrgEnv-gnu that you are running. The easiest way to figure out these 
is to look at the CRAY_LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable. If for some 
reason that isn't set then you can alway look at the output of "CC 
--verbose". You also need to point to an OSMesa install 
<http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/ParaView_And_Mesa_3D>.

Hi Christopher,

Are you by any chance logged in with ssh X11 forwarding (ssh -X ...)? It 
seems the error you report comes up often in that context. X forwarding 
would not be the right way to run PV on your cluster.

Depending on how your cluster is setup you may need to start up the 
xserver before launching PV, and make sure to close it after PV exits. 
IUn that scenario your xorg.conf would specify the nvidia driver and a 
screen for each gpu which you would refernece in the shell used to start 
PV through the DISPLAY variable. If you already have x11 running and 
screens configured then it's just a matter of setting the display 
variable correctly. When there are multiple GPU's per node then you'd 
need to set the display using mpi rank modulo the number of gpus per node.

I'm not sure it matters that much but I don't think that you want 
--use-offscreen-rendering option.

Bogdan,

The deal is this: the vtkPVDReader is designed for ParaView, it uses
some of the core client-server infrastructure in ParaView. Thus, you
can't use it directly is a VTK-based C++ executable without
initializing ParaView environment. Initializing ParaView environment
is not too complicated. Look at pvserver_common.h or pvpython.h, it
should give you the necessary code. You basically use
vtkInitializationHelper API to initialize the ParaView environment.

Hope that helps,

Utkarsh

Burlen, Uktarsh,

Thanks for the clarification. I will give this a try and write back.

This might actually also help me with another problem I am having at setting the timestep for which I want to fetch cell/point data.

This also has to be done from the pipeline object, right?

Kind Regards,
Bogdan

Hi Rick,

It doesn't look like you're building for the compute nodes, either that 
or you've got GPU's. for example Qt is on and OSMesa is off. I'm 
unfamiliar with the superbuild process but normally that would produce a 
binary that couldn't be run on the compute node without gpu's.

I'm expecting my installs to work with the Kitware provided client 
binaries. For that in the past at least we need to match their build 
options to some some extent. For example the VisIt bridge would be on. I 
know there have been some updates to how the server capabilities are 
exposed so I'm not sure how much of an issue that is in 4.2.

Message-ID: <AE1E7296-5AC0-40A5-9981-8AA2A9F501A0@ivec.org>

Hi, 
  Is there a rendering model that you have for testing the performance of the paraview?
I have install paraview on our GPU cluster and would like validated it someway other than
just putting timing calls around the Render command in the parallelSphere.py script.
 
Or is that sufficient?

Cheers,
Chris B

Yeah - I have two builds - one for the login nodes and one for the compute
nodes ? yeah, I included the login node build - but the structure is
essentially the same.

Simon,

Although, explicit pvpython/pvbatch test isn't necessary, it's worth
doing it since sometimes the paths to locate ParaView's Python modules
can get messed up between different executables.

> So for individual python packages, I will need to do the import test for all the packages I want to test in the script right?

Yes, ideally.

HI Burlen,
  Yes I am for the purpose of testing on our debug queue.  But you are bang on with setting the DISPLAY environment variable.

so setting in the preview module
setenv LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT 1
or in bash in the job script
export LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT 1

but also adding 
export DISPLAY=:1 
is needed to render on the GPU.

Renders the parallelSphere.py example with no errors across multiple nodes.

my mpirun command looks like this

mpirun pvbatch parallelSphere.py

note we have PBSpro installed so it determines the -np ##-number of processors/cores based on the 
#PBS -l select=.....

So now to see if I can render something awesome!

IUn that scenario your xorg.conf would specify the nvidia driver and a screen for each gpu which you would refernece in the shell used to start PV through the DISPLAY variable. If you already have x11 running and screens configured then it's just a matter of setting the display variable correctly. When there are multiple GPU's per node then you'd need to set the display using mpi rank modulo the number of gpus per node.

Hi Uktarsh, Burlen,

The PVD reader is finally working, thanks for the suggestions.

Initializing the environment before using the PVDReader is what did the trick.

Should it be useful to somebody else, you can use something akin to the following for initialization:
	static vtkSmartPointer<vtkPVOptions> options = vtkSmartPointer<vtkPVOptions>::New();
	char** execName = new char*[1];
	execName[0] = vtksys::SystemTools::DuplicateString("foobar_string");
	vtkInitializationHelper::Initialize( 1, execName, vtkProcessModule::PROCESS_CLIENT, options );

Useful examples are pvserver_common.h, pvpython.h (as suggested by Uktarsh) as well as vtkCPCxxHelper.cxx.

Is there any risk of a memory leak if the environment is initialized multiple times? For instance, if this is done within a class' constructor and this class is
instantiated several times during program execution, or will this initialization be confined to the live of the object?

Kind Regards,
Bogdan

Hi Chris,

your reply makes me suspicious that you may not really be rendering on 
your tesla yet. LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT should not be needed and as far as 
I know this is a Mesa specific variable. Even in an interactive batch 
job you shouldn't use x11 forwarding for ParaView (I couldn't tell if 
you are using it or not, but I wanted to be clear about that because it 
doesn't scale well). If I were you I'd verify that you're really using 
the your tesla by examining the output of glxinfo.

My user wants to know if ParaView can "loft" shells?  Any ideas?

Thanks!

Alan



Alan, 

A shell is a 3d element with 0 thickness in the mesh but includes a thickness in the formulation of the element.  By default paraview renders a shell as a thin surface. In some cases this is good enough but in other cases such as contact it is difficult to visualize the mechanical behavior of the element without being able to see the thickness of the shell that the mechanical formulation uses.  In some codes a shell element that has thickness for visualization was called ?lofted?  there may be other terms used to describe this.

Not as far as I know. One issue is that different FEM codes parameterize shell elements differently:

+ Some assume that the surface is a true mid-surface. Others allow different "top" and "bottom" heights. Others "loft" only in one direction.

+ Some treat neighboring shells as constraining the offset nodes for problems where contact may be an issue. Others do not do contact.

The latter in particular can lead to tricky problems when angles between neighboring shell elements are acute. Doing something akin to the "tube" filter, but for quads+tris would be easy as a Python programmable filter. Doing something where neighboring elements were taken into account would be significantly more work.

 Hi,

I am starting to work with VRPN. I have a HeadTracking Glass and a FlyStick
and i would like to know if i can have the Grab Interaction with an Object

I am using the grab interaction with the Model Transform Matrix, and it
works fine.

My next goal is to use it this interaction with a single object, rotating
and translating the object instead of the whole Model Transform Matrix

Can someone help?

Thanks in advance

Hi all,

I am working with a scientist who is attempting to run a complex programmable filter that uses two inputs and produces one output.    The script generates a result for the first time step is applied on, but if you advance paraview to the next time step, the new result is NOT generated.  (no streamline update, no recalculation, nothing..)  I am not seeing why this is the case.  If you advance the time step, then force a re-apply of the filter, it will run, but that doesn't help for automated image generation.  I am sure the problem has to do with updating the pipeline, but I don't have enough experience with the programmable filter to say for sure what needs to be done.  If someone could take a look and let me know if there is a simple solution, I would be grateful.

I have tried this with the same result on PV4.0.1 and PV4.1.0.  I have not tried on PV4.2 as our reader plugin has not yet been compiled against 4.2.

Thanks,

Josh

Hi Josh,

I've noticed that the default programmable filters does not advertise that
it handle time. To properly do that you can use the attached XML plugin.

Let us know if that fix the problem.

The Programmable Filter can handle time but it has to be done explicitly.
You'll need to do the proper calls in RequestUpdateExtentScript,
RequestInformationScript and Script. (i.e. RequestData). You can use inInfo
and outInfo to set the required information objections like
UPDATE_TIME_STEP, TIME_STEPS, etc.

That'd work. You can use the benchmark module [1] too to give you info
at a finer granularity.

Hi Utkarsh,

unfortunately I am still not able to pass both argument into ParaView superbuild cmake line using the -DPV_EXTRA_CMAKE_ARGS option that Ben suggested. Any help on this is much appreciated

thanks

Message-ID: <1414610502.63426.YahooMailNeo@web126105.mail.ne1.yahoo.com>

Hi all,

  I started using Paraview (4.2.0) about a couple months ago and it was working normally. I don't know exactly when this problem begin because I don't use Paraview everyday but now when I double click on Paraview.exe, no window pops up anymore. Using process monitor, I could see that Paraview.exe does a few things on my computer but I couldn't figure out what went wrong. 

   I'm running Paraview 4.2.0 64-bit on Windows 7 Ultimate. I scanned my computer for virus and malware and got rid of whatever they found. But the problem remains. 

   I don't know if this is relevant but I installed Qt 5.3.2 some time ago. I tried removing Qt and installed Paraview again but it didn't help. I also tried removing my antivirus program and installed Paraview again. It also did not help. 

  Has anyone run into this problem before? Any thoughts on how this problem can be solved or how I can troubleshoot this? 

Joe

Try removing your paraview settings.
On windows this should be at:
%APPDATA%\ParaView\ParaView4.2.0.ini

Elsewhere it is at:
~/.config/Paraview/ParaView4.2.0.ini

Looking at the generated command line, it looks like the value is being
put in as a single argument. Try separating it with a ';' instead of a
space.

Thanks for the response, David.

What you suggested did change the symptom a bit. After I remove the ini file, I was able to see the Paraview logo appear after I execute it, which I did not see prior to the removal. 

However, the window still doesn't show up. Is there anything else I can do?

Message-ID: <C1449BEF40D5CC46B21272BB35290659BA332DEE4D@EXC3.ad.colorado.edu>

Hi.
I have not been able to get PV 4.2.0 to work in stereo interlace mode on my Windows 7 64 bit system. Default mode seems to be red-blue, and that works fine, but  I get this error on startup when I specify -stereo-type=Interlace


ERROR: In C:\DBD\pvs-x64\paraview\src\paraview\VTK\Rendering\OpenGL\vtkOpenGLCamera.cxx, line 167

vtkOpenGLCamera (000000000B119790): failed after Render 1 OpenGL errors detected

0 : (1282) Invalid operation

PV 4.0.1 starts in interlace mode with no problem on the same system.
Suggestions? I didn't see any known bugs regarding this.

In ParaView 4.2.0, I have found a few cases where the color legend disappears, and I can't get it back.  Has anyone else seen this, and found a way to replicate it?  Mind passing the voodoo on how to replicate this bug?

Thanks,

Jean,

I just tried with PV 4.2.0, Linux Mesa (local server), Linux hardware rendering, and my local Windows 7 box (Kitware download), and they all worked with -stereo-type=Interlaced.  At least I believe they worked, nothing crashed and the image looked good.  (Note that the command is Interlaced, not interlace).  Other than that, the only thing I can think of is to delete your config files.  http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView_Settings_Files.

David,

  The problem is now solved. It appears that ParaView does not work with Python 3? Is this true? 

  While I tried calling ParaView from Maltab, I got error message like this: 
     File "C:\Python34\Lib\site.py", line 176
            file = sys.stderr)
                  ^
     SyntaxError: invalid syntax

  which according to a post on Stack Overflow, indicates an error occurring when trying to run Python 3 script using Python 2 interpreter. 

  I then removed Python path from PATH variable and also removed PYTHONPATH variable and ParaView was working again. 

  So is it true that ParaView is not compatible with Python 3? 

Joe

Glad you got it working.

And yes it is true that ParaView does not yet support Python 3.

HI Burlen,
  Thanks again.  Is there and easy way to verify that Paraview is using the GPU ours are TESLA C2075?

Should I need to change the "MOD"(?) setting so it is rendering rather than compute?

IUn that scenario your xorg.conf would specify the nvidia driver and a screen for each gpu which you would refernece in the shell used to start PV through the DISPLAY variable. If you already have x11 running and screens configured then it's just a matter of setting the display variable correctly. When there are multiple GPU's per node then you'd need to set the display using mpi rank modulo the number of gpus per node.

Hi Utkarsh,
  Is there simple way to see if my installation of ParaView done using the ParaViewSuperbuild is configure with the correct gl libs to run on the GPUs.  Should I need to install a version with Mesa to benchmark against or is there a way to that without installing a second version?

Do the log files show if Paraview is rendering on Hardware or software?

Cheers,
Chris B.

Subject: [Paraview] Installing Paraview with system IceT
Message-ID: <CAN5F63FHewYV5q0tk5XBTOMaU+CNQ6aN_xm12Waq8dpQbfjKSA@mail.gmail.com>

Running ccmake to build the Makefile for Paraview-4.2.0 informs me
(when I set "VTK_USE_SYSTEM_ICET=yes") that it can't find
icetConfig.cmake or icet-config.cmake


"CMake Error at VTK/CMake/vtkModuleMacros.cmake:830 (find_package):
   By not providing "Findicet.cmake" in By not providing
"Findicet.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
   asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "icet", but
   CMake did not find one.

   Could not find a package configuration file provided by "icet" with any of
   the following names:

     icetConfig.cmake
     icet-config.cmake

   Add the installation prefix of "icet" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
   "icet_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "icet"
   provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
   installed.
 Call Stack (most recent call first):
   ThirdParty/IceT/CMakeLists.txt:58 (vtk_module_third_party)"



Installation of IceT-2.1.0 (appears to be the same version as packaged
with PV) provided a IceTConfig.cmake file in /usr/lib.

Construction of a symbolic link from

/usr/lib/icetConfig.cmake -> /usr/lib/IceTConfig.cmake

moves me past my first error (when I specify cmake option
"icet_DIR=/usr/lib") but then ccmake complains that

"CMake Error at VTK/CmakeLists.txt:480 (export)
  export given target "IceTCore" which is not built by this project.
CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:774 (export):
  export given target "IceTCore" which is not built by this project."

Google searches suggest I should attempt to modify some file to use
IMPORT statements, but I have no previous experience constructing
CMakeList or .cmake configuration files.

Any help setting this up (or confirmation that Paraview can be built
with IceT as a system library) would be appreciated.

I have experienced it too, but cannot reproduce it!

For me it happened so far only in a client-server setup. When I grab the 
surface (HDF5/XDMF files; 2D unstructured cells) and rotate or move it, 
the legend comes back, but will disappear as soon as I release the 
surface again.
When copying the very same data to my local machine and visualizing it 
in a local ParaView session, everything works fine.

Very odd indeed!

openSUSE 13.1

to verify make a small job on 1 node. In the shell you are starting 
pvserver in, after you've done all the environment settings you need to 
to setup for paraview, run "glxinfo" and look for the gl vendor, gl 
version and gl renderer strings. these should give you info about your 
tesla. that can be done from your batch script or at the command prompt. 
some systems like cray mpiexec command (aprun) runs the program on a  
different set of nodes than the batch script itself, so for a system 
like that run "aprun -n 1 glxinfo".

Subject: [Paraview] Integrate over a volume - integrating over surfaces?
Message-ID: <D077EA3C.1C9D8%mwelland@anl.gov>

Hello,

When I try to apply the 'Integrate variable' over a 3D object I get a strange (wrong) answer. In my simulation results the integral even changes in time, while the variable does not. I tried a simple cube with a constant function value of '1' everywhere, for which the integral is apparently zero.

Am I missing something? I have had reasonable results in 2D, is there something with 3D I should be aware of?

Cube function (PVD /VTU) attached.

Thanks,
Mike

Building ParaView with system IceT hasn't been tried/tested before. I
suspect it would need some tinkering/patching to get working.

Subject: [Paraview] ExtractSubset not working well in pvpython
Message-ID: <CANPyyBLjTBZuJii7kLYvM4=ZYCVb5-HmbrrgUCagoZ0c6TyFMA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have a structured grid computational domain of size 800,2,800. I want to
extract the information along a line and so I do the following in my python
script.

ExtractSubset0 =
ExtractSubset(guiName="ExtractSubset0",IncludeBoundary=0,VOI=[399, 399, 0,
0, 0, 799], SampleRateK=1, SampleRateJ=1, SampleRateI=1)
data = servermanager.Fetch(ExtractSubset0)
numPoints=data.GetNumberOfPoints()

However, when I plot the information on that line, I see it has only
extracted information between 0-399 in the z-coordinate direction. I even
printed numPoints to confirm how much information is extracted and I get
"numPoints=400". I am using PV 3.98.0.

Any help on this will be appreciated.

Subject: [Paraview] Shapefiles?
Message-ID: <7F781841FF1E044388AFA42B70703A7A8A0089EC@CHIMBX6.ad.uillinois.edu>

Hi ParaView,

I found this thread: www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2012-December/027026.html<http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2012-December/027026.html> indicating vtkGDALVectorReader would be added to mainline ParaView, and I do see an option load DEMs, but are ESRI ShapeFiles supported? I can't get any .shp files to be recognized or load.

There's an earlier thread from 2011 discussing vtkgis_vector_reader, is that still the recommended ShapeFile loader?

Thanks,
Mark

Yep, that's the bug.   I have seen it local server.  Anyone else have any ideas how to replicate it?  If anyone does see it, mind writing a state file and sending to me?  It's a long shot, but maybe that will help us figure out what is going on.

Thanks,

Alan

I have experienced it too, but cannot reproduce it!

For me it happened so far only in a client-server setup. When I grab the surface (HDF5/XDMF files; 2D unstructured cells) and rotate or move it, the legend comes back, but will disappear as soon as I release the surface again.
When copying the very same data to my local machine and visualizing it in a local ParaView session, everything works fine.

Very odd indeed!

My workstation:
openSUSE 13.1
ParaView 4.2.0
Intel Core i7-4800QM QC Processor
NVIDIA Quadro K2100M Graphics Card

Subject: [Paraview] "Annotate Time" filter in slice view?
Message-ID: <20141031.132949.379518051.furutaka.kazuyoshi@jaea.go.jp>

Dear ParaView experts,

How can I use the "Annotate Time" source in Slice View?
With a slice view, selecting it from the 'Sources' menu
creates a render view and the source is displayed there...

Or, are there any ways to show current Time in slice view?

I'm using ParaView ver.4.2.0 on linux and windows PCs.

Thanks in advance.

This indeed is a missing feature in the Slice View. Please feel free
to add a feature request to the bug tracker. Cleaning up the Slice
View is on our todo list for near future.

Subject: [Paraview] Structured Grid: strange view of surface+edges
Message-ID: <5453254C.5000405@img-online.de>

Hello,

I have a structured grid which seems to be well formed. If I load the 
vtk file with ParaView 4.2 or 4.1 some strange lines appear if the 
display mode surface+edges is selected. See the attached screen shot. 
For the strange lines/edges no corresponding lines in the wireframe 
model can be found. The modes surface, wireframe or points are looking 
good. I checked the data again and again. I cannot find any issue in the 
structured grid. I have attached the vtk file and some screenshots.

I also viewed the grid with a small self-written python application 
using VTK 6.1.0. It shows the same behaviour as ParaView.

At the moment I do not have any idea how to go on. Any help is appreciated.

Michael

Hi Michael,

Just for your information. I tried the file with Paraview 4.2.0 on 64 bit
linux
and see no such artifacts. So the file itself seems to be fine.

Regards,

Marco

Subject: [Paraview] help with stereoscopic 3d
Message-ID: <5453AF5B.9070005@gmail.com>

I can save an animation/screenshot without issue, however when I select 
option for stereoscopic 3d left/right big gaps appear in the volume 
rendering. image below. Does anyone have any insight into why this is 
happeing, or can suggest a workaround? I'm using 256 cores, the dataset 
is a large image volume and I need the cores for the memory.

Same for me -- I cannot reproduce the problem. It could potentially be
a driver/OpenGL issue?
