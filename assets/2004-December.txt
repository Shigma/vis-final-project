Please submit a minimal script that duplicates this problem to the bug 
tracker:

http://www.paraview.org/Bug

You can only delete sources from the end of the pipeline.  Once you 
connect the output of one source to the input of another, it cannot be 
deleted.  Your script will have to delete sources in the reverse order 
that it created them.

This is an internal driver language for ParaView and is not documented 
to my knowledge.  You can look in the ParaView source tree under 
GUI/Widgets and GUI/Client for classes that define these methods.

Subject: [Paraview] Visualizing Deformation Fields (ITK)
Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.58.0412031148280.7611@caip.rutgers.edu>

Hi,

I use the ITK deformableregistration8 example programs to register 2
volumes. The results are good when I compare the diff images and also the
warped image looks good.

However when I try to visualize the deformation field outputted within
Paraview, it doesn't look right. One thing that I noticed was that if I
regate the dx component in the field, it looks right, under paraview.

Is this a bug or a format issue ?

thanks,

I think they are just thin wrappers around std::vector, std::map. Any 
info on the Standard Template Library should tell you more.

I am in need of both VTK and paraview.  Problems is if I do the install of 
both one overwrites the other's libraries and make one or both not work.  Is 
there a solution to have both installed on one machine?  Or can paraview's 
VTk be built entirely?  It does not build the java wrappers and does not 
have that option available.  Thanks in advance.

You can use the same source tree, but not the same build tree.
So, what I do is this:

ParaView <---- Source tree
ParaViewBuild  <--- binary tree uses ParaView for source
VTKBuild <--- uses ParaView/VTK as the source tree for VTK


You have to run cmake separately for ParaViewBuild and VTKBuild.

Hi all

While anlysing the paraview code (1.8 Beta version) I came to know
that they are inserting class name along with some command functions
into vector NewInstanceFunctions
  and mapper ClassToFunctionMap. 

But I donot able to trace out that where they are using these
functions in future,
Can any one help me out 
Thanks in advance

Since the getsockname function takes "int" on some platforms and 
"socklen_t" on others, there is a try-compile that tests which signature 
is available on your platform.  Look in CMakeError.log for text like this:

"Determining if getsockname accepts socklen_t type"

Somewhere after that text should be the compiler error message 
indicating why ParaView thinks your platform does not have a getsockname 
with socklen_t.

So I guess the executable can't be built as getsockname is not defined.
Can this be fixed by just adding -lsocket to the compile line?

Thanks

Probably.  I'll have to update the try-compile test to include it.  For 
now you can work around the problem by manually editing CMakeCache.txt 
and switching the line

VTK_HAVE_GETSOCKNAME_WITH_SOCKLEN_T:INTERNAL=0

to

VTK_HAVE_GETSOCKNAME_WITH_SOCKLEN_T:INTERNAL=1

Then run make again.  You might also have to add -lsocket to your 
CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS setting.

I have been having massive headaches trying to have Paraview and VTK 
installed on one machine.  I found a solution the paraview binary release 
works perfectly, and is not affected by my VTK libraries.  The problem is I 
need the MPI option, so I need to compile it from source.  I CAN compile it 
from source no problem, BUT I want the results to be like the paraview 
release, which is one BIG "paraview" files with no libraries (having 
libraries causes a problem).

So to reiterate, I know how to compile paraview, but I want to know how I 
can build paraview to be exactly like the binary release but with MPI 
support?

Thanks in advance.

Set BUILD_SHARED_LIBS to OFF. Static versions of the libraries will be
created, but they need not be installed for ParaView to run.

That will require you to have built MPI as a static library.

ParaView always builds its own Tcl/Tk (8.4.5) that comes in the source 
tree, so the version of Tcl on your system does not matter.  As far as 
this error, I think you have to build ParaView with

VTK_USE_COCOA:BOOL=OFF
VTK_USE_CARBON:BOOL=OFF
VTK_USE_X:BOOL=ON

This is a bug related to the change of a reader from subclassing off of 
vtkSource to subclassing off of a different vtkAlgorithm subclass.  I've 
add it to my to-do list to fix.

Hi again,

Building ParaView using the X11 libs will work, I know - I have tried 
that.
So, I was trying to build ParaView with the Carbon approach in order 
not to be
depending on the X11 installation.  ParaView was building with the 
Carbon
approach a while back, but was buggy, probably because of the lack of 
OS X
support in the Tcl/Tk version I used then.

Regards
Jon

Thanks, I've changed back to using the sources instead of algorithms and 
it is behaving a bit more predictably now.

Brad,

I changed the line as you suggest below and it now compiles fine.  I
didn't need to add a -lsocket to CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS.

Thanks for the help.

Hi Jon,

ParaView currently only supports builtin TclTk.

The TclTk in ParaView is build using two scripts. The
configure_tcltk.sh.in does the configure (cmake) step, and
build_tcltk.sh.in does the actual building. The two scripts are only
written for standard unix using X11.

Hello,

is it possilbe that each serial file out of a parallel file is only saved on

correct one? Saving all serial files on a network file system makes the I/O 
the bottleneck.

Jon,

	Could you try to apply the attached patch to your ParaView source. Go 
to ParaView/Utilities/TclTk and then type:

patch -p0 < /tmp/patch (assuming you save the attachment in /tmp)

Let us know how this work, thanks

Andy,
Your comments about how Tcl/Tk is built reminds me of a problem I have. Can Paraview's cmake files control the build properties of the embedded Tcl/Tk? Or will I have to hack configure_tcltk.sh.in in the source tree?

In my case, I've got a x86_64 platform on which a gcc bug prevents me from building an optimized 64-bit executable. Until I get it solved I'd like to build with -m32, but CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS doesn't propagate to the Tcl build.

Thanks,
Lee

All you have to do is add something like:

CFLAGS="@CMAKE_C_FLAGS@"
export CFLAGS


to both build and configure.

Hi Mathieu,

I did the path and did a new make without make clean which resulted in  
the
following error :

Would it be an idea to do a make clean first and then a new make ?

Jon,

	What is the value of this variable from your CMakeCache.txt:

TK_INTERNAL_PATH ?

	Mine look like this :

TK_INTERNAL_PATH:PATH=~/ParaView/VTK/Utilities/TclTk/internals/tk8.4

Thanks
Mathieu

Mathieu,

Mine looks like :

//The path to the Tk internal headers (tkMacOSXPort.h).
TK_INTERNAL_PATH:PATH=/Users/jonk/cvs/VTK/Utilities/TclTk/internals/ 
tk8.4

Regards
Jon

Mathieu,

I did a completely clean build of ParaView using your patch.  Still I  
am seeing
this error:
Building .o file from CXX:  vtkTkRenderWidget.o...

My TK_INTERNAL_PATH is pointing at the same directory as yours now:
~/ParaView/VTK/Utilities/TclTk/internals/tk8.4

Any suggestions ?

Jon

Subject: [Paraview] integration of a variable
Message-ID: <41BFFBD3.9060708@tfd.chalmers.se>

Hi,

I would like to integrate a variable over a surface; is this possible in 
  paraview, and so, how do I do this?

An example of this is, when I have the variables velocity and density 
defined, and I want to calculate the massflow going through a surface. I 
need to calculate the cell face velocity times the cell face density 
times the cell face area times the cell face normal and then sum these 
values for all cell faces lying on a surface. Can this be done in Paraview?

Thanks,

Berend van Wachem.

Hello,

is it possilbe that each serial file out of a parallel file is only saved on 
one of the nodes. How can one make sure that each node is trying to read the 
correct one? Saving all serial files on a network file system makes the I/O 
the bottleneck.

Subject: [Paraview] Removed windows.h from VTK headers.
Message-ID: <41C053B2.5060508@kitware.com>

Hello all,

I have committed changes to VTK that completely remove windows.h from
most of its headers.  This addresses bug #836.  Documentation of this
change is available in
VTK/Utilities/Upgrading/FindWindowsMangledMethods.cmake.

Since many files were changes I will not report their individual
revision numbers.  The CVS tags surrounding this change are:

VTK-RemoveWindowsH-pre
VTK-RemoveWindowsH-post

This change results in a 70% compile time reduction on Windows
compilers because the compiler does not have to parse the 280K lines
of source the preprocessor produces from windows.h.  Only a few OpenGL
and Tk headers in the Rendering directory and
Common/vtkCriticalSection.h still include windows.h, and these may be
removed in the future.  All VTK code that still includes windows.h
does so through vtkWindows.h which includes a minimal part of the real
windows.h header.

In order to avoid the windows method mangling problem all three
possible names for such methods (Foo, FooA, and FooW) are provided
using a preprocessor trick.  Users can detect places in their own code
that may need this trick by using the cmake script
VTK/Utilities/Upgrading/FindWindowsMangledMethods.cmake.

There are two backward-compatibility issues:

1.) User code that used the windows API without including windows.h
   that worked before because VTK included it will now break until the
   explicit inclusion is added.  This is considered acceptable because
   the code was technically wrong in the first place.  As a quick-fix,
   users can define VTK_INCLUDE_WINDOWS_H in their application and VTK
   will include windows.h as it did before.

2.) A few virtual functions in VTK were renamed and replaced by
   non-virtuals that forward their calls to a virtual internal
   implementation.  User code calling these methods will not be
   affected.  User code wishing to override these methods in a subclass
   will have to rename to the internal name.  Such user methods will
   also be exposed by the above mentioned CMake script.  The most
   common such method is GetClassName, which has been renamed to
   GetClassNameInternal.  Since user code is supposed to define this
   method by using vtkTypeMacro or vtkTypeRevisionMacro, this should
   not be a problem.

Hello, I'm looking for any information related to the algorithms
employed by Paraview when it is used in parallel mode. I know how to
setup Paraview to run in parallel mode.  I am interested in learning
how Paraview distributes the VTK pipeline (I'm assuming it does) and
how it handles the distribution of data files.  I would like to use
this information to be able to see if I could do anything to optimize
my current Paraview installation.

Any help that can be offered in this matter would be greatly appreciated.

once we get to execute data I would expect the streaming mechanism to

When running in mpi mode this is the default if the output path is not 
on a shared disk.  The only restriction is that the path be the same on 
all the local disks.  If you read it back in using the same set of nodes 
then each node should only need to read data from the file it wrote.

Not by default.  ParaView is a visualization tool, not a computation 
tool.  It has some support for computation but most of it is provided to 
make interactive visualization more meaningful.  It is possible to write 
plugins to ParaView that will do whatever computation you want, but 
you'll have to write the corresponding VTK filter yourself.

Message-ID: <41C18A5A.1040602@temf.tu-darmstadt.de>

I want to create a animation using data, which is stored in files with 
names "efield-{number}.pvd", where {number} is the number of the 
timestep. I'm only able to create an animation, using the data out of 99 
datafiles (efield-1.pvd to efield-99.pvd). If there are files, where the 
{number} is greater than 100, ParaView doesn't recognize the files 
automatically as it does, when I have less than 100 files. When I try to 
set the range for the {number} manually in the animation menu, then 
ParaView dies with a segmentation fault.

Does anyone know how to solve this problem? Thanks in advance!

This is a known problem with batch mode.  It is on my to-do list to address.

Basically the VTK pipeline is duplicated on all the nodes.  Since VTK 
supports "streaming" data in pieces, each node executes 1 of N pieces 
for N nodes.  Then one of several approaches for rendering the results 
on a single screen is taken.  For small data the geometry is collected 
onto the client process and rendered locally.  For large data the 
geometry on each node is rendered on the node itself and sent to the 
client in the form of an image and a z-buffer.  The client composits it 
for rendering.

For more information you can get the "ParaView Guide" book:

This is a known problem and will eventually be fixed.  For now you can 
extend the limit by editing the source and rebuilding.

Edit the source ParaView/GUI/Client/vtkPVFileEntry.cxx and modify this line:
#define MAX_FILES_ON_THE_LIST 100

Basically it is there as a hack to prevent ParaView form taking a very 
long time to display the timesteps when there are millions in one directory.

Hi John,

I have been working pretty heavily on adding AMR and multiblock
pipeline support to VTK. Meanwhile, I stopped supporting AMR in
ParaView. This is why you are getting that error. The filter simply
does not recognize the data type. Once I have something working in the
new pipeline (very close), I will look into getting ParaView working
again. As far as I can remember, ParaView 1.6 (or maybe even 1.4, I am
not sure) was the last version that worked with AMR datasets. Please
remind me to send you some information on the new pipeline stuff as
well as the changes you will have to make to the reader sometime after
xmas or new year.  And the hierarchical box datasets do not handle
extents like structured data. They handle extents more like
unstructured data (piece based). The smallest update unit is one
block.  I think it is possible to have a hybrid model. I am still
thinking about it. If you have questions, feel free to ask them.

Mathieu,

Removing the source code in /ParaView/Utilities/TclTk and hacking the
CMakeCache file to use the installed TclTk version instead did the 
trick.
I have a Carbon ParaView running on the Mac now.  There are a few minor 
GUI
refresh issues, but apart from that it works.

I also did an Experimental build, so you can see the result on the 
dashboard in
an hour or so.

Regards
Jon

There is an "Integrate attribute" filter that will do this, but it did not 
make it into the 1.8 release.  It is accessible in the 1.9 (nightly/CVS) 
version.
I also wrote filters to compute the cell face velocity, and a filter that 
uses the above two filters to compute surface flow.  I had not thought 
about density.  You would have to use the array calculator to include that 
into the calculation.

If you try these filters, give us some feedback so we know how they work.

Charles.

Also,

There is a filter to move polydata around called 'Balance', the
limitation is the data has to be poly data.

*** Begin evangelizing ***

For general datasets of any type there is a filter called 'D3'.

D3 is a great filter for doing data distribution and computing ghost
cells in parallel.

For instance you can load in a single datafile and the 'distribute' it
to all the nodes just by invoking the D3 filter on it (you can run the
'Process Id Scalars' filter to see the distribution).

D3 should work on any data type and like a said will compute ghost cells
for you. The ghost cell computation makes a big difference (external
faces on 1 dataset went from 80M tris to 2M tris). Also obviously you
will now get the 'correct' visualization results instead of seeing file
or processor boundaries.

In addition the nice spatial distribution has the side benefit that your
parallel rendering (to desktop) and especially to tile-display will be
accelerated.

A description of this filter should have been included in the ParaView
users guide... but was not.... grumble...grumble... :)

Message-ID: <41C081A1.8020003@temf.tu-darmstadt.de>

I want to create a animation using data, which is stored in files with 
names "efield-{number}.pvd", where {number} is the number of the 
timestep. I'm only able to create an animation, using the data out of 99 
datafiles (efield-1.pvd to efield-99.pvd). If there are files, where the 
{number} is greater than 100, ParaView doesn't recognize the files 
automatically as it does, when I have less than 100 files. When I try to 
set the range for the {number} manually in the animation menu, then 
ParaView dies with a segmentation fault.

Does anyone know how to solve this problem? Thanks in advance!

Dear Charles,

Thanks for this! This does exactly what I want. It can integrate any 
point variable over a cut; by using the array calculator you can easly 
get total mass flow - or any other property I presume.

How is the filter called and used to compute cell face velocity? Does 
that create another array?

Thanks,

Berend.

Integrate Attributes:
Only integrates over 2D surfaces for now.
Creates one point and one vertex.
Point and cell data for this point and cell contain the integrated values.
A new "area" cell array is created.
All of the integrated attribute values are displayed in the GUI.

Surface Vectors
Will either project vectors onto the surface, or give the component of the 
vector perpendicular to the surface.
The new output vector point attribute has the same name as the input vector 
attribute.  A glyph filter is still needed to show the vectors.

Surface flow.
Outputs a point and vertex.  It integrates the dot product of a vector 
field with the surface normal.  It puts the result in a attribute called 
surface flow.
The value is also displayed in the GUI.

All three filters have toolbar buttons which are initially hidden.  In 
version 1.9 the user can customize which buttons are visible in the toolbar.

Charles.

Message-ID: <87y8fuca5c.fsf@home.homenet.ru>

Hello, All

One question which interests me a lot: 

Is there any way to limit amount of datasets selected by 'Probe'
filter? 

My concrete problem is:

I have file with several datasets - pressure, velocity, energy and so
on. I want to display chart which shows changing of these parameters
along some line. But absolute value of parameters vary a lot, 
average pressure - 1e6, velocity - 1. 

So, I cannot clearly see changing of parameters on chart. It would be
great if I could select which datasets will be displayed in
chart. Another nice feature that would help a lot - logarithmic axis.  

Any ideas?

check my posting to this mailing list on May 14. A quick hack was to 
convert the multi-datasets results to Grace format. If people are 
interested in the code, I'll be happy to send it. Drop me a note.

Subject: [Paraview] save locations in distributed mode
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.58.0412211707080.371@terra.mcs.anl.gov>


Hi,

I'm running ParaView 1.8.2 in distributed mode and have a few questions 
about saving images and batch scripts.  When I go to save a batch script 
ParaView opens a dialog box where I can enter the path and filename of 
where I want to save the script.  ParaView wants to save it on the local 
filesystem, that is local to the client.  But what I really want to do is 
save it on the server side, since that is where I would want to run 
pvbatch, in order to take advantage of the parallelism of the cluster.  
Also, all of the data is stored on the server side, so I really couldn't 
run pvbatch on the client side anyway.  Is there currently a way to 
specify that you want to save a batch script on the server side, rather 
than the client side?

Similarly, from the animation view, when I try to save images the dialog 
box shows the client side filesystem.  Here again I would like to be able 
to save them on the server side, as I have much more disk space there, 
among other reasons.  Is this currently possible with 1.8.2? 

In both cases, if it is not currently possible, is it likely that it could 
be made possible in future releases?

Thanks,
joe.

I have a problem about paraview when I uses OpenFoam.
   I have installed paraview as following:
   tar -xf paraview.1.8.0.tar
   when I enter the directory 
     $HOME/OpenFOAM/linux/paraview1.8.0/bin and run paraview,an error printouts as following:
-----------------------------------------------
    ParaView error:initialize Tcl failed
    TK_Init error:invalid command name "Tcl_findLibrary"
-----------------------------------------------
    How can I correct this error?
    Thanx.

   S.H.Yang

Message-ID: <a6bc6cc041228064452e8805c@mail.gmail.com>

Hello, I am looking for recommendations for benchmarking Paraview. I
would like to run some tests to obtain some performance measures for a
few of my Paraview installations.  Has anyone done anything similar to
this? Any input would be appreciated.

Jeremy,

We have done quite a bit of benchmarking here at Sandia. The
recommendation I would give is to base the benchmark on something
everyone can easily replicate.

For instance:

If you are benchmarking parallel rendering performance use something
like Sphere source.

You can easily make just about any number of total triangles you wish. 

Example: Sphere source Theta resolution=800 Phi resolution=800 Num
tris=1.27 Million

Also things like sphere source will give nice even 'pieces' to each
processor, so that you don't have to worry about things like load
balancing.

Run ProcessIDScalars and make sure that you have a reasonable load
balance. (If you don't have a reasonable load balance... Then run
'Balance' or 'AllToN' for Poly data or 'D3' for any other kind of data.)

Things that I think are important to record...
1) You should record times for both the 'interactive render' and 'still
render'
2) You should record whether 'Triangle strips' is ON or OFF
3) You should record whether 'Immediate Mode' is ON or OFF
4) You should record the version of ParaView
5) You should record what you used for 'Load balancing'
6) You should record the average memory usage on the processors (I've
had folks complain that ParaView was running very slow on their 4M cell
datasets... The problem was obviously too much mem usage...1% cpu...99%
disk access)

7) You should look carefully at the timer log for any thing folks might
find interesting... :)
8) You should record some of the info under the 'Help...About...'
dialog, which render module is being used, whether software rendering is
ON or OFF, etc, etc... (Note older versions of ParaView do not have
this.... :)

9) You should also record the normal things like...
I'm using 3.4Ghz P4's with 1Gig mem and using MPI over Myrinet... Or
whatever...

If you want to benchmark things like 'computing isosurfaces on
structured data', then I suggest things like Mandelbrot source and
wavelet source for the same reasons as above.


!!! Five cautionary notes !!!

If you are doing a more general benchmark... Like how fast can I
interact with a 13M Tet10 dataset. Be careful of the following...

1) Run ProcessIDScalars and make sure that you have a reasonable load
balance. 

2) If you're looking at unstructured data, run 'Extract Surface' and
look at the information tab to get the number of triangles you are
actually looking at. Or if you've computed an isosurface, same thing.
(We had a dataset that we couldn't interact with, 13M unstructured
dataset. We found out we had generated 80 Million triangles from the
data when computing 'External Faces' within the vtkDataSetMapper, not
having ghost cells computed in the load balancing is a killer... We ran
D3 and then we only had 2 Million triangles...)

3) Mem usage again... We've found that about 1M Unstructured cells per
processor, gives fairly good performance.

4) LOD is mostly your friend but every once and a while it can shot you
in the foot. If you have a very large dataset and the size of the LOD
happens to be just under your composite threshold you may spend a bunch
of time computing the LOD (server side) and collecting the LOD (client
side).

5) Related to 4.. Compositing Threshold default of 10MB might be too
high in my opinion. (I would vote for 5MB perhaps)

Example: Dataset with 400 time steps. Animate through time. Very common
operation obviously.

Lets say that the geometry generated at each time step is 9.99MB, so
that it is beneath the threshold and will be delivered to the client.
Lets do the math... (using 10MB just for easy math).


400 time steps x 10MB = 4GB

In this example the 4GB is delivered over a 100T network connection to
the client.

So 100T gives you about 10MB/sec at best. So 4GB / 10MB/sec = 400 sec or
6.66 minutes! Obviously an 'evil' amount of time that's basically
'wasted' on delivering geometry to the client, since the client will
only render it once and then throw away.


Good luck, if you want me to post Sandia's benchmarks just give a
holler.

Best,

Subject: [Paraview] paraview script (for load data to form an animation)
Message-ID: <1E2E66102E75104D8C740340EBCD986701BC685A@tomoex.tomotherapy.com>

Hi, I am relatively new to paraview.  I have a series of data files (in vtk
format).  I can load them individually to view as 3D surface.  Now I want to
create an animation using each file as individual frame.  I am wondering if
I can realize that with a script.  Could anyone provide me with an example?
Also, from my experience, it seems the paraview will automatically adjust
camera position (and zoom) when new data is loaded (I assume it
automatically set the view centered on the object).  Can I fix the camera
position and orientation when new data is loaded? 
 
Thanks for any input.
 
Regards,
Quan

Quan,
 
When you open the file. Hit the 'Timesteps' button next to the filename
widget. Once all the timesteps (numbered files) are loaded...
 
You can go to 'View... Animation....'
 
Select the first file as your 'source'
Select filename as your 'parameter'
 
and then animate over the files that way. Camera setup should stay and
not adjust... (that has been my experience anyway).
