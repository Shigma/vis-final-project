Subject: [Paraview] Changes in Sources/Filters applied in all RenderView's
Message-ID: <CAE=GJrbYYFNkd6baiqNiD7Dj+8H2gaH33dY3qFBUjkv2esbpSQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi!

Is there a way to apply in all the RenderView's  the modifications made in
the data sources/filters of the pipeline browser?

I've tried linking them but with no sucess.

Hi,

What you are asking for is the default behavior of ParaView.

You may want to give a more precise description of what your are trying to
achieve.

Best regards,

Mathieu Westphal

To elaborate, any changes under the "Properties" section of the
Properties panel will be reflected in all open RenderViews. Changes
under the "Display" and "View" sections, however, apply only to
objects in the active RenderView (the one with the blue box drawn
around it). I believe this is what Leonardo would like to have updated
all at once.

There is no setting to link all "Display" and "View" properties
because not all display types (also called representations) have the
same properties, nor do all view types have the same properties. You
could do this programmatically with Python with a bit of somewhat
involved code. Easier may be to click the "Copy display properties"
button to the right of the "Display" header in the Properties Panel,
switch to another display in the other view, and click the "Paste
copied display properties".

HTH,
Cory

Hi, Alan!

Thanks for sharing, I'll use the trick after solve the issue. Indeed it 
doesn't related to the fontconfig errors and currently I'm stuck with 
it... Don't think it's somehow related to pv, seems the problem is in my 
system -- it glitches here and there! Testing is testing:)

Closing the loop, this is now fixed in ParaView master and will be
available in ParaView 5.6.

Message-ID: <CADHSJjDfbF9bpyf7DE1+ny1gBeom37AJfhcDoEXG_Dczy41Yag@mail.gmail.com>

Folks,

We have moved to Discourse (quite successfully). Given the latest
round of phishing emails, with spam email masquerading as being sent
by legitimate users, may be it's time to close the paraview mailing
list? I expect we can shut down the mailing list with a default reply
message instructing any sender to use discourse.paraview.org instead.

Thoughts? Objections?

Yep. Traffic on the mailing list is very low now, and activity on
Discourse is up to around ~14 messages a day on weekdays, which I take
to be a sign of healthy usage.

The current paraview website has a link to mailing lists:

https://www.paraview.org/

buried within that is a message that the lists have been deprecated and 
a link to the discourse forum:

https://discourse.paraview.org/

It may be helpful to make the forum a little more prominent on the 
Paraview website

Do subscribers to the lists have to unsubscribe, or will they just go
quietly away?

Thank you,

Tom,

No one will be required to unsubscribe. Whether you are subscribed or
unsubscribed, you won't receive any new messages once the list is
shuttered.

When you close the mailing lists, would it be possible to set it up so that anyone who attempts to email to those addresses gets an email back with a clear message about the mailing lists being closed down and instructions on posting to discourse?

Hi,


I was wondering if there has been any development in this issue since July?


We will soon provide a Spack package for Damaris. Damaris now supports Catalyst as an in-situ visualization backend, so it would be great to be able to support Damaris+Catalyst through Spack.


Thanks!


Matthieu

Yes this is something that Simone has been trying to tackle:

https://github.com/RemoteConnectionManager/spack/commits/packages/update_paraview

You can try a few different things, but nothing really helps.
In the spack package it might help to set the GIT_DIR env to point to
the catalyst directory before the patch/staging part, but that might
just prevent the warning about exploring across file boundaries.

On top of that someone (Andy!) probably needs to adjust the catalyze.py
script to add the checks there, since this error will always occur when
building from a tarball.

Subject: [Paraview] Structured Grid display
Message-ID: <F247BFF2-F26D-457B-B372-17F647039958@iris.washington.edu>

Hello,

I have created a structured grid and when I select ?Point Gaussian? for representation, I can see all the points with proper color representation (attached image). However, when I change the representation to ?Points? or ?Surface", I only see the top set of points and points on two edges (attached image)! Any suggestions? 

Thanks,

?manoch

I would expect points/lines representation to only show the outer surface
(all surface rendering does an extract surface behind the scenes), so none
of the inner points should be visible, but it is strange that you aren't
seeing both top and bottom sides.

I am thinking that the extent defined wrong. Can you share the dataset?

Also note that this mailing list is moving to discourse.paraview.org and
will be shut down in the very near future.

Hi David,

Perfect! That was exactly the problem. My grid was 26x5x29 and I was setting the extent to 0,26 ,0,5 ,0,29 and as soon as I changed it to 0,25,0,4,0,28 it worked perfectly. I really appreciate your help.

Best,
?manoch

Subject: [Paraview] Sequence of TIFF
Message-ID: <fe2e54bbbe321c3188c7a49a2adc4eb5@openmail.cc>

Hello,

I am a beginner in the use of ParaView. I would like to show the 
deformation of a mesh on top of a series of tiff images, where
0001.tiff
0002.tiff
...

correspond to instants 1, 2, etc. I can open the TIFF files in ParaView. 
I tried setting a Force Time filter on each of them. The images are 
displayed, but I would like to show them only at the specified time 
frame. Is that possible? Thanks!

Hi,

If you want to animate tiff file series, you need to append specific
name to them like something below.
foo_0001.tiff
foo_0002.tiff
...

Then ParaView can recognize them as a tiff sequence, and the file
browser should look like foo_..tiff. In reading it, uncheck "Read As
Image Stack" so as not to read a list as a volume.

Best,

p.s. ParaView discussion has moved to https://discourse.paraview.org.
Please post future questions on that forum.

Subject: [Paraview] glyph/pattern of a vector field
Message-ID: <CAMDHuzZFE0VrdYDp-E2DMS3DA=o768SO3LsKqnwGJ+ZN+Y_Wdw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I have a question on how to make a glyph/pattern of a vector field: a
current distribution on a regular rectangular grid in my case.
Which file format does better suit for this?

Looks like vtk files can be only used for scalars (?),
and vtu files are only designed for a complex unstructured grid (?) (I may
be wrong.)

2D distribution is fine for me, to start with; 3D would be appreciated as
well.

Thanks,

Message-ID: <5BA8FC73.8020502@rhpcs.mcmaster.ca>

Hello,

I write a programmable source in python, in which I hard code the path 
to a data file. Now I want to use a file dialog in the python script. I 
have installed easygui in .local of my home directory and it works fine 
with python 2.7. But "import easygui" doesn't work in the python shell 
from Paraview. Any suggestion about how to install a python package so 
that it can be imported into Paraview? Thanks.

There was a post on the mailing list discussing the topic with subject 
"installing additional Python modules" back in Dec 18, 2017.

Best,

Subject: [Paraview] point to surface
Message-ID: <786ab57b-c772-85ae-bfad-c6fe19a1974a@bsc.es>

Hi every one

I have a list of point (coordinate x,y,z), using*table to point* I can 
visualize it on PV.
But I would like to know the total area of those points.
So I tried *glyph* (sphere, all the points) than *integrate variable 
*and I obtained the area.
But the area is depending of the radius that I put on *glyph* parameter.

those points are the deposition of particles in a complex geometry(human 
nasal cavity)
They are calculated when they intersect the surface mesh of the nasal 
cavity.

my question:
There is a way to "project" those points on the mesh surface (then 
filtering and *integrate variable* to calculate the total area) ?

thank you

Hadrien,

I?m not sure what you mean by the ?area? of points. As I?m sure you know, particles are 0D elements and themselves have no area to speak of. As you said, you can use the glyph operation to create a surface around each point, but the surface area in that case is simply the surface area of the sphere size you chose times the number of points.

You?ve asked if you can project the points onto an existing mesh surface. I don?t know of an easy way to do that, but let?s put that problem aside for a moment. Assuming you could, what good would that do? Points on a surface are still just points. The surface area of your mesh (nasal cavity) will be the same surface area regardless of how many points are in it and where they are.

Can you more precisely describe what it is you are trying to measure?

-Ken

Message-ID: <9a61918c-9465-aba8-7abc-29f5dc0e8891@mh-hannover.de>

Dear mailing list members,


I have problems compiling ITK (4.13.1) with VTK from PV>5.2.0 (it works for 
PV-5.2.0) and it was suggested that it is likely a PV issue 
(https://discourse.itk.org/t/compile-itk-vtkglue-on-with-vtk-from-paraview/1289) 
so I created an issue here:
https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/issues/18454
But I am not sure if that is the best place to ask.
Any ideas what could cause the problem for PV > 5.2.0?

Any help or hints are very much appreciated
Roman

Message-ID: <CAGRS4a4d8BM_3hPwX=T+5cNGem0JA4X-XX7ngj1KhrA640-_tg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am trying to install Paraview with source code and following the steps as:

1: git pull source code - directory name is paraview
2. to build in paraview in separate directory - directory name
paraview-build
3. from inside the paraview-build directory  ccmake ../paraview
4. Try to configure but error related to VTK
5. So checked that VTK directory is there in paraview but empty
6. git pull VTK source code in paraview/VTK
7. ccmake ../paraview
8. No VTK error but error related to protobuf:

                                    CMake Error at
VTK/CMake/vtkModuleMacros.cmake:934 (add_subdirectory):
                                    add_subdirectory given source
"vtkprotobuf" which is not an existing
                                    directory.
                                    Call Stack (most recent call first):
                                    ThirdParty/protobuf/CMakeLists.txt:40
(vtk_module_third_party)

                                    CMake Error at VTK/CMakeLists.txt:138
(export):
                                    export given target "protobuf" which is
not built by this project.

                                    CMake Error at VTK/CMakeLists.txt:146
(export):
                                     export given target "protoc_compiler"
which is not built by this project.

9. My solution:
                   created protobuf directory in
/ParaView/VTK/ThirdParty/protobuf and extracted source code of protocol
buffer

Still I am getting same error statements upon configuration.

How do I proceed for successful paraview build.

Hi Govind,

ParaView has a number of dependencies it handles using `git submodules`.  
The normal way that I download and install ParaView is by first cloning 
the main repository, then checking out which branch I need, and finally 
checking out the submodules like this:

	git submodule update --init --recursive

This downloads the submodules (such as VTK) into their proper locations.  
I would delete your separate copy of VTK and use the submodules instead 
because there may be a mismatch between the two.

You could also clone the repository including the submodules all at once 
using the following:

	git clone --recurse-submodules <repo url>

or by pulling the latest commits from the remote with:

	git pull --recurse-submodules

NOTE: This mailing list is being deprecated, and further discussion 
occurs on the ParaView discourse

Regards,
Chris

Subject: [Paraview] DO_NOT_PARAVIEW_EXECUTABLE_AFTER_BUILD
Message-ID: <CAGRS4a4iO00-rBYOjHniZoNc2htO-=gafsh2TNqR20ArkjGrhA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,
Paraview build has been done successfully but as I am not able to run with
./bin/paraview

I have checked bin directory in paraview_build, there is not paraview
executable.
Only executable with paraview name is paraview-config.

How do I resolve this?
