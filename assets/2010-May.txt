Subject: [Paraview] ParaView 3.8.0 RC2 Available for download
Message-ID: <x2qa44d4ae01005010840mbfa6661fpecf140ffeb27ba53@mail.gmail.com>

Hello All,

I am pleased to announce the availability of ParaView 3.8.0 Release
Candidate 2 binaries for download on the ParaView download page. Final
binaries and/or more release candidates should follow shortly.

http://paraview.org/paraview/resources/software.html

The original release notes can be found here:

http://www.kitware.com/news/home/browse/Paraview?2010_04_05&ParaView+3.8

The release was built using 643a47f3c24f5dde33dccbbb0f77a94d268866df of the
'release' branch on Git. We didn't make an official tag as this branch will
be going away as we implement our branchy git workflow.

Since the RC1 binaries released the following Bugs have been addressed.

BUG: Fixes for installing FFMPEG in ParaViewServers.
COMP: Link to FFMPEG if it is enabled
  We cannot transitively link in FFMPEG through vtkIO we must link it
directly if enabled.
BUG: Disable Surface LIC plugin on MAC as major work needs to be done to get
this working correctly.
Fix ExtractDocumentation to append and not override the runtime path.
ENH: Speed up vtkManta by changing to a one level manta pipeline.
  Requires Manta r2439 or greater because of the new flag I added therethat
enable the new Manta pipeline configuration.
BUG: Fix SMExtractDocumentation to work on Windows.
  ExecuteSMExtractDocumentation was recieving $(OutDir) on Windows and did
not know how to expand it. Changed the calling ADD_CUSTOM_COMMAND to pass it
in
BUG: Fixes for documentation to properly be configured and copied.
BUG: Changed Documentation CMakeLists.txt to properly configure
index.html.in while only copying the rest of the documentation files and
images.
BUG:0010565 install VTK level vtkManta libraries with plugin.
BUG: Fix pvblot plugin's CMakeLists.txt
COMP: Fix FFMPEG try_compile link failures.
  When using older ffmpeg on the Mac the try_compiles are failing because a
link error and thus were not producing accurate configuration results.
BUG: Fix copying images into build tree to not replace @.. at .
BUG: Remove conditional logic so that OpenFoam is always built.
BUG: Do not build pvblot if python is not enabled.
ENH: Add missing install rules for FFMPEG to ParaViewServers.
ENH: Fix pv_install_library macro for use on Mac
BUG: Fix Macro to correctly install libs and their symlinks on Mac which use
a different nameing convention (lib.*.dylib) than Linux (lib.so.*).
ENH: Add display list control to manta benchmark and improve reporting.
ENH: Allow choice of manta accel structure.
  Expose it and sliding window to benchmark.
BUG: Fix streaming app build.
ENH: improve manta benchmark, especially make it measure preprocess time
BUG: Disable another manta test that isn't passing on the dashboard.
BUG: Adaptive wasn't clearing screen during interaction with colormap
scalars.
BUG: Silence proxy warnings by removing unused parallel proxy
configurations.
BUG: Disable Manta multilayer render test until it works.
BUG: Fixes to make adaptive streaming test at least run.
BUG: adaptive app settings were not being read until user opened
preferences.
BUG: Fix infinite recursion from selection inspector.
  Fixed infinite recusrion in selection inspector when "Create Selection"
was
  clicked for a source with global ids.
COMP: Fix dependency issue with documentation.
ENH: Clear out FilePrefix and FilePattern when loading time file series.
  When loading a time series of restarted Exodus files, it is important to
  let vtkPExodusIIReader to convert a FileName into a pattern of files.  It
  will not do this if the FilePrefix or FilePattern changes.  This can
happen
  when loading state.  To get around the problem, set those ivars to NULL
  when loading multiple files.
BUG: Ensure the model is updated when attribute type changes.
BUG: Fixed issues with initial display of data.
  Utkarsh and I worked through several issues with initial display of data
  in the charts, adding back in the attribute mode for the charts, and X
  array combo box update/save issues.
BUG: Fix two bugs in python trace and add a test.
BUG: with a server connection the global controller is null on the client.
Fix when server connection in global controller is null on client.
Fixed a bug where we had multiple definitions of the CTRL+O shortcut.
BUG: Export interface classes and move cleanup virtual destructors.
BUG: Fix install rule for sqldrivers.


Please feel free to try them out and provide any feedback about your
experiences with them.


Thanks!

Subject: [Paraview] Compiling with MinGW - why is it looking for QtChart?
Message-ID: <BAY109-W107781780BDB59EB2B7A4AB2F00@phx.gbl>


I am trying to compile PV with MinGW. Everything goes fine till I get a surprinsing error (see below).
I tried to add the required option of the linker --enable-auto-import everywhere I can in the cmake configuration file (in all the linker options and even in the linker name itself at the end) without any change (how does cmake works with this file??).
And I do not know if this lacking option is the reason of the following errors.
Any idea?

Subject: [Paraview] Improvement in memory usage (no more leakage)
Message-ID: <4BDCD8CC.1090708@web.de>

A few moons ago, I wrote about what seemed to me to be memory leaks in 
Paraview -- that was back in the days of version 3.6.2.
See: http://markmail.org/message/julmjsirhzf3mosz

Fast forwad to today. I've loading datasets in Paraview all day and I'm 
pleased to observe that the memory issues I flagged have gone away. In 
the past I would have had to restart Paraview after a few data loads, 
but that's now a thing of the past, and I would like to thank the 
developers for a job well done.

Hi Dave,

When I tried to compile the RC2 source
(643a47f3c24f5dde33dccbbb0f77a94d268866df of the 'release' branch) on
OS X 10.6.3, Qt 4.6.2, CMake 2.8.1 with PARAVIEW_USE_MPI=ON, the
compilation fails when linking libCosmo.dylib with

Undefined symbols:
  "_MPI_Graphdims_get", referenced from:
      MPI::Graphcomm::Get_dims(int*, int*) constin Partition.cxx.o
.....

The error was fixed by cherry-picking
d6dc7df4e8f18aa8533c3c6e5be3507989ae3251
(COMP: Fix link errors building libCosmo on OSX with MPI enabled.)
and
9dff61f664dd4f918336cabe49a42f87bc0e393f
(ENH: fix configure error if MPI_EXTRA_LIBRARY is not set.)
from master so perhaps these could be backported?

Also, at the download page, links to the following files seems to be
broken.
ParaViewServers-3.8.0-RC2-Darwin-Universal.tar.gz
ParaViewServers-3.8.0-RC2-Darwin-x86_64.tar.gz
ParaView-3.8.0-RC2.tar.gz

p.s. Thanks for adding the OpenFOAM reader to the RC2 binaries.

Seems like http://paraview.org/files/v3.8/ParaView-3.8.0-RC2.tar.gz is missing... Further, Plugins/VisTrails in the .zip download still contains the .hg repository and I assume that all the .cvsignore, .svnref, .gitmodules and .gitignore files are also no longer required in the source package.

It would also be great if the Ogg/Theora writer was mentioned in the release notes (as promised by David DeMarle) ;-)

Hi,

Testing ParaView-3.8.0-RC2-Linux-x86_64 on a clean install of Ubuntu 10.4,
pvpython and pvbatch have a dependency on libdc1394_control.so.13 which
can't be found.

Subject: [Paraview] XDMF/HDF5 reader memory usage
Message-ID: <l2sb8f06b561005030406r55184925y129fb56fecf61972@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm experiencing some strange behaviour with the XDMF reader when
trying to create an animation of the data contained in a set of HDF5
files. My approach is as follows:

1. One XDMF file which is a temporal collection containing links to a
list of other XDMF files
2. One XDMF file for each time step (linked to by the XDMF file
above), each of which is a spatial collection of several 2D structured
grids. The data for the grids is contained in HDF5 files (also one for
each time step).

When I open the file with the temporal collection in Paraview, the
data shows up as a temporal collection as expected. I can step back
and forth in time and everything seems to work just fine. However, as
I load in more time steps (by stepping forward in time), Paraview's
memory usage keeps increasing. It seems like it is not freeing the
memory associated with the old time step when reading in a new one.

To illustrate this problem, I've uploaded a collection of XDMF and
HDF5 files to the following location:

http://www2.eng.cam.ac.uk/~tb302/xdmf_example.tar.gz

There are 10 time steps in the collection. The data set is very small,
but it should still show the problem (I could easily generate larger
data sets if necessary). I get the same behaviour in Paraview 3.6 and
3.8 on both Centos 5.3 (64 bit) and Mac OS X 10.5.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Best wishes,
Tobias

Subject: [Paraview] Optional input and Change input behaviour
Message-ID: <y2he7f43c4f1005030502g101ffceene79bab8a8b7b83cf@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I wrote a filter with 3 inputs, one being optional.
The first time I update the filter, if I don't set any input to the
optional one, all is ok. Then I "Change input" from the pipeline
browser, set an input to the optional one. All is ok as well.
Problem is: I want my optional input back to "no input". How can I do
that from the "Change input" panel?

Thanks!

Thanks Takuya,

The links have now been fixed and I cherry picked those fixes onto the
release branch.

Hi Michael,

The links should be working now. Thanks for catching the extraneous
repository files, I had hidden files not visible and forgot to remove them.
I just cleaned up both source packages and re-uploaded them to the download
page.

Weird, Does 3.6.2 not work on that machine as well? I did both builds with
the same machine/compilers.

Hi,

I also confirm the same problem on a clean install of Ubuntu 10.04
64bit, though 3.6.2 works on the machine. The depending library is
libvtkPVPython.so. Since libdc1394_control.so.13 is listed around the
video codec libraries if I run objedump over the .so file, I have a
vague intuition that the transition from ffmpeg may be causing the
problem.

$ objdump -p libvtkPVPython.so

Hi!

Is there a way to access the Information Properties in Python? For the 
display properties it is

GetDisplayProperties(object)


Is there also something like "GetInformationProperties" ? I'd like to 
know the extents of my volume data such that I do not exceed the maximum 
slice when changing that in a script.


Best regards,
Christian

Hi Andy,

Thanks for your reply. It seems pretty similar. I can merge the outputs
(element and node files) from Tetgen and then give a try to the plug-in you
developed. Let me know if you are interested for sharing.

Below is my guess on the mesh file format. Is it right?
E4T(Element type)     1(Element Number)  4913  5569  4914  5530 (4 Nodes)
    2(Material type)

By the way, is it possible to read Abaqus mesh files into Paraview, or
export mesh files in Paraview to a format which Abaqus could recognize?

Thanks in advance,

Ken

You should be able to call this method directly on your proxy object that
own your dataset such as a filter of a reader.

extent = data.GetDataInformation().GetExtent();

Hi Ken,

can you tell us if ParaView 3.6.2 can take advantage of SLI architecture?

Thank you very much

Message-ID: <z2zc9adba421005040602vaf2acb8s9898a0c46202989f@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm noticing big delays when running in ParaView in parallel (running 2
cores on latest ParaView version with OpenMPI v1.2.6).  To reproduce:

   - create sphere
   - create cone
   - group datasets (group the sphere and cone)
   - extract block (and select one of the objects)

The first time the extract block filter is called it will hang for about 15
seconds.  After the first update it is instant when reapplying after
changing the block to extract.  But, this will happen again if I delete the
extract block filter and add another one.  I tried debugging this but the
hanging occurs after the RequestData for both processes.  Does anyone know
what could be happening?  Or, can anyone give any advice for what to try?

Thanks in advance,
Paul

Message-ID: <C80595AC.1B9B5%kmorel@sandia.gov>

I have no experience with SLI so absolve myself from any promises of performance.  Perhaps someone else on the list has tried ParaView on SLI.

It is my understanding that there needs to be no specific software support to take advantage of SLI.  All I can offer is the obvious advice: get plenty of CPU memory, use a 64-bit build of ParaView so that you can use that memory (turning on VTK_USE_64BIT_IDS might be a good idea, too), and run with immediate mode rendering off (Settings -> Render View -> General).  However, I have no idea what kind of rendering performance increase you might expect.

Message-ID: <45E114F9-7BD4-403A-AB8A-BC7CC1C9A909@ucalgary.ca>

When building ParaView 3.8.0 RC2 on OS-X, I run into the following:

/Users/eric/source/ParaView-3.8.0-RC2/Plugins/VisTrails/PluginMain.cxx: In member function ?void PluginMain::Startup()?:
/Users/eric/source/ParaView-3.8.0-RC2/Plugins/VisTrails/PluginMain.cxx:170: error: redeclaration of ?const char* path?
/Users/eric/source/ParaView-3.8.0-RC2/Plugins/VisTrails/PluginMain.cxx:143: error: ?const char* path? previously declared here
/Users/eric/source/ParaView-3.8.0-RC2/Plugins/VisTrails/PluginMain.cxx:171: error: redeclaration of ?vtksys::String appDir?
/Users/eric/source/ParaView-3.8.0-RC2/Plugins/VisTrails/PluginMain.cxx:144: error: ?vtksys::String appDir? previously declared here

Note that this is a somewhat non-standard build of ParaView, as I am trying to build as both 32 bit and 64 bit against Qt 4.6.2 using Cocoa.

The solution appears to be fairly simple, as the redeclarations are in fact redundant and can be commented out.  Here's the diff:

170,171c170,171
<         const char* path = vtkProcessModule::GetProcessModule()->GetOptions()->GetApplicationPath();
<         vtksys::String appDir = vtksys::SystemTools::GetProgramPath(path);
---
>         // const char* path = vtkProcessModule::GetProcessModule()->GetOptions()->GetApplicationPath();

Subject: [Paraview] Add values from 2 files and number of points in a Slice
Message-ID: <x2ha5b864971005050100g5b63c9afga98c242a975d5ce@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

I am trying to add scalar values from two different .vtk files with the same
geometry: I have two files giving me the potential in each node and I would
like to add these potentials. I was trying to use the calculator, but I can
just manage to treat each file at a time. Any ideas?

Another thing I was wondering if it could be done is increasing the number
of points in the spreadsheet View when we make a Slice. I am trying to get
some points on a circle and so I perform two slices of my volume: first a
spherical slice and then a planar slice, but when I try to see it in the
Spreadsheet View (so that I can export the points) only get 50 points. This
is not enough for a plot I pretend to do and so I would like to increase the
resolution. For example having a sphere with with more points when I do the
slice.

Thanks,

best regards,
Nuno

Stephen,

That's a known issue with PV 3.4.0. See

You might want to consider upgrading to PV 3.6.2 or 3.8 RC2.

The calculator should work if you previously append the two dataset with

Subject: [Paraview] Relative Paths in ParaView State Files
Message-ID: <EFC3B3CF-CE84-4D0F-92C2-7F93A5F0D397@mac.com>

Is it possible to store the relative path of data files in ParaView state files instead of absolute paths? 

I've found that the state files become broken if you rename or move their parent directories. To fix this, you can edit the state files in a text editor and change all the absolute paths to relative paths. 

But is there a hidden switch or preference in ParaView that controls this? If not, it would be a nice feature.

Hi All,
Has anyone had experience of using volume rendering after applying 
"Temporal Interpolator" to your data set?
I have a regular grid time series data set. I would like to "increase" 
the temporal resolution and applied "Temporal Interpolator" filter to 
it. Here is my paraview pipeline:

Data -> TemporalIntepolator -> Threshold

In this configuration, I cannot enable volume rendering in the 
Threshold/Display Style. However if the pipe line is

Data -> Threshold

I can do volume rendering in Threashold/Display Style. What should I do? 
Thanks a lot.

Best,
xunlei

Paul,

Looking at the log, doesn't look like any of the filters is taking
time. Any possibility of attaching to the server processes while it's
waiting and looking at the call stack? I could not reproduce this on
my machine, fyi.

Currently, this is not possible. But I am adding a bug report to have
a mechanism to update filenames after loading state files.

Message-ID: <r2q303b1f661005051148of5697234wadcad8b5c02d28c2@mail.gmail.com>

Hi!

I have a quesation about the paraview interface (GUI):
is the entire interface based on QT?
 I read that if you need to change any of the paraview code, specifically
the interface you need to have a comercial lisence, obviously as we know you
can add filters to it and customize the interface.
I am trying plan developing a software which uses a lot of Paraview
functions and some other software packages so we are thinking of eiter
changing the paraview interface or writing our own interface using QT and
just use the paraview codes we need. does anyone has any idea?
any suggestion is appreciated.

This is not exactly accurate.

First, you _used_ to need a commercial license of Qt if you wanted to
change ParaView's Qt code (or add new Qt code) AND if you wanted to
release this code under anything other than GPL.

Second, this is not the case anymore. Qt is now (also) licensed under
LGPL. Therefore, you can make any changes to ParaView's GUI as long as
you comply with LGPL, which is much more forgiving than GPL.

Yes. The most generic HDF5 support is through Xdmf. See xdmf.org. We
also support a few other HDF5 based formats. Are you referring to
specific flavor of HDF5?

Yes, but since hdf5 is a generalized data storage format, you need to
write an xdmf file that tells paraview how to interpret the contents
of the hdf5 file.

Hi,

If you have two files "file1" and "file2" with scalars respectively named
"potential1" and "potential2" and you set file1and file2 as inputs of a
"Append Attributes" filter, you will have one data set with two attributes named
"potential1" and "potential2".

If you plug the calculator to the "Append Attributes" filter, you just have to
type the following function: "potential1+potential2"

The output of the calculator will have one scalar, default name being "Result",
containing the addition of the two input scalar.

Hi,

I am back with this extent bug.
Reminder: a filter that produces output with larger extent than input has a
weird behaviour.

I attached a ServerManager XML that describes the vtkImageResample filter. With
 this filter, you can choose an output spacing smaller than the input, inducing
  an oversampling of the input image. You can load it in ParaView as a Plugin.

In ParaView, this simple pipeline will reproduce what I call here a bug
(however, I hope that someone will tell me that my XML is soooo bad):

      builtin
          |
    Wavelet1 (Menu Sources -> Wavelet)
          |
ImageResample1 (Menu Filters -> Image Resample )


- Wavelet is set to default values
- Set, in ImageResample, the AxisOutputSpacing property to: 0.5   0.5   0.5
- Apply

Now, take a look at the Information tabs:
- Wavelet1 has an extent of [ -10,10 , -10,10 , -10,10 ] and same bounds.
Normal, spacing is 1
- ImageResample extent ought to be [ -20,20 , -20,20 , -20,20 ] with bounds
[ -10,10 , -10,10 , -10,10 ]. But it is not! Extent is unchanged, but the new
spacing has been takn into account as the bounds are now [ -5,5 , ...]. My
conclusion is that ParaView prevents the output extent to be greater than the
input one (to be convinced, change the AxisOutputSpacing to 2: everything work
well).
Weird additional things: the outline representation is aligned to the input
bounding box (good point: it has to be). But setting representation to slice or
volume throw an error or show the slice with wrong extent/bounds.

I hope that someone will tackle this problem: I thing it is not so rare to have
output extent greater than input extent (oversampling, curved planar
reformation, ...)

Hi,

I submitted a tiny bug few weeks ago:

I wonder if someone could reproduce it. I do with WinXP and Linux
Fedora, git development version.

Thanks a lot

Subject: [Paraview] node ordering mismatch when saving vtu as exodus and
	vice versa
Message-ID: <j2yb0a936c01005060042ke202d77ga875cf83b3caba0d@mail.gmail.com>

I think there is a mismatch in node ordering when we want to save vtu
file as exodus and vice versa for 20-noded hexahedral meshes. This is
due to the different node ordering scheme for VTK and exodus for this
particular element type.

e.g., if you open an attached vtu file, it is fine. If you save that
as .e file and open looks different. That was due the different
ordering!

Thanks,
HNG

Hi,
I forward this e-mail from the VTK mailing list, as ParaView users may be
interested
and not necessary VTK subscribers...

I add a note: the concerned vtkStripper is called Triangle Strips in the
ParaView Filters list.
But it can be used to strip lines as well as triangles!

I've tried attaching a debugger and it seems to be waiting for
communications on the socket whenever I stop it.  I can only assume it is an
issue with the MPI setup on the system I am using.  When I launch on the
main cluster and connect I do not experience this problem.

 I tried to translate ParaView into Chinese. When dealing with xml in
paraview, I found it is so hard to translate some parts, like property in
 Object Inspector in ParaView, into Chinese. I have tried to change the
 encoding xml has used, like replace Utf-8 with Unicode,but the result is a
error. How can I translate paraview into chinese completely? Would you give
me some advice, please?
   Thanks!

Subject: [Paraview] Python scripting with native OpenFOAM reader for
	ParaView 3.6.2
Message-ID: <t2r8da594fb1005060620t63f63466wcd0c3590fc31ba3d@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

Recently I was encouraged by a colleague to use the Native OpenFOAM reader
for ParaView, which was created by Takuya Oshima. I really appreciate the
reader since it loads my data faster and uses less memory than the standard
OpenFOAM reader and it works faster than using the OpenFOAM utility to first
create vtk files and than load these one by one. However using the vtk
reader in a python script I am able to run identical postprocessing for
similar cases. Now I would like to combine the better performance of the
native reader with python scripting. I am able to call the reader from
either a script or from the python shell, but I would like to be able to
select only certain patches, or the internal mesh separately. I used the
python trace function to find a way to do this, however the trace that
results does not work when repeated in the shell. For instance if I load
data from a case as:

foam = OpenFOAMReader(FileName='foam.foam')
foam.CellArrays = ['U','p']

as suggested from the trace, I get an error message from the second line
stating that there is no CellArrayStatus:

File
"/home/tom/Paraview/paraview3.6.2/paraView3-bin/Utilities/VTKPythonWrapping/paraview/simple.py",
line 433, in CreateObject

setattr(px, param, params[param])

File
"/home/tom/Paraview/paraview3.6.2/paraView3-bin/Utilities/VTKPythonWrapping/paraview/servermanager.py",
line 204, in __setattr__

setter(self, value)

File
"/home/tom/Paraview/paraview3.6.2/paraView3-bin/Utilities/VTKPythonWrapping/paraview/servermanager.py",
line 2329, in setProperty

return self.SetPropertyWithName(propName, value)

File
"/home/tom/Paraview/paraview3.6.2/paraView3-bin/Utilities/VTKPythonWrapping/paraview/servermanager.py",
line 252, in SetPropertyWithName

raise RuntimeError, "Property %s does not exist. Please check the property
name for typos." % pname

RuntimeError: Property CellArrayStatus does not exist. Please check the
property name for typos.

I was wondering if there is a solution to this problem?

If someone could help me, that would be great!

Kind regards,

Tom Fahner

You can use the --script option.

  --script=opt          Set a python script to be evaluated on startup.

e.g.

I think he meant that he wants to pass arguments to the script when he launches it (the script), not run a script when he launches paraview from the command line.

To pass command options to the script, then you could set your arguments in
sys.argv before calling the script.

import sys
sys.argv = ['script.py', 'arg1', 'arg2']
execfile('script.py')

Hey J?r?me,

I don't know if this will be helpful to you, but I wrote a plugin (a long time ago, using an older API) that added a toolbar button which popped up a dialog and then ran a python script. The solution I used was to do a search-and-replace on the python script string to put values returned from the dialog directly into the python script before running it.

Use pqPythonDialog::runString(const QString& script).  Calling
pqPythonDialog::runString("execfile('script.py')") is the same as calling
pqPythonDialog::runScript(QStringList("script.py")).

I have updated the bug with my testing. I was unable to reproduce on Windows
7 64bit and Linuxwith 3.8.0RC1 and Git Head. Tested reverse connection as
both manual and command startup.

Can you confirm that the reverse server setting is saved in one of the pvsc
files (http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView:Server_Configuration )  for the
user launching paraview, and provide more information on the reverse
connection you are using please.

Subject: [Paraview] Active stereo cave
Message-ID: <4BE2DE3F.9040509@ufz.de>

Hello,

I try to use ParaView on a stereo (active shutter glasses) cave. I
compiled PV 3.8.0-RC2 with MPI support on Linux. For testing I use only
1 pc connected to one 1 beamer of the cave. Stereo display is working in
general (I tested it on that machine with glxgears -stereo and also the
paraview standalone executable can be run in stereo).

But when I try to run this in a client / server setup the stereo is not
working. On the server (no matter if starting normal (pvserver cave.pvx)
or with MPI (mpiexec pvserver cave.pvx)) I only see a normal (mono) image.
I start the client with paraview --stereo --stereo-type="Crystal Eyes".
Do I have to specify the stereo argument also to the pvserver? Or can it
be a problem that the client runs on a virtual machine? The client
paraview application also shows a mono image. Is it needed that the
client machine has also stereo capabilities?

Thanks in advance!!
Lars.

Hi!

Is there a way to show the user some MessageBox? I'd like to get some 
user input to control a scripts execution. I am thinking about something 
like that: "Binary Measurement? Yes/No", or "Enter background value in 
the awesome text box below."

Best regards,

I've done some testing, and I agree that it does appear to be working 
correctly with 3.8.0RC1 and with a recent build of 3.9.0.   I tested 
with "--state=" and "--script=" and both are behaving correctly.     I'd 
say that this ticket can be closed.

In paraview 3.8 you can use this in the python console:

var = raw_input("Enter something: ")
print "you entered ", var

It's not as pretty as a QMessageBox, but it works.  In fact, it would be
trivial to change the c++ code to make a QMessageBox appear instead of a
QLineEdit appear.

This bug still exists, and is actually obnoxious.  Furthermore, there is another twist to it - you cannot reset the background color by just saying Edit/ View Settings/ General/ Restore Default/ OK.  I cannot edit this bug - you may want to add the previous sentence as a note to the bug.

Hi,

I wonder if someone could reproduce it. I do with WinXP and Linux
Fedora, git development version.

Thanks a lot

Subject: [Paraview] node ordering mismatch when saving vtu as exodus and vice versa

I think there is a mismatch in node ordering when we want to save vtu file as exodus and vice versa for 20-noded hexahedral meshes. This is due to the different node ordering scheme for VTK and exodus for this particular element type.

e.g., if you open an attached vtu file, it is fine. If you save that as .e file and open looks different. That was due the different ordering!

Thanks,

Hi

I have an issue that I am not sure how to solve, I was wondering if someone
could help me please:

I am trying to compile Paraview on windows platform using visual studio, I
have QT and VTK  installed correctly but when I compile the source code I
get an error which says it can not find Python.h library, the issue here is
that when I CMake'd the source code I didn't check the option for the python
scripting therefore I am not sure why I am getting such an error, that would
be unless some other parts of Paraview is using Python.h. How can I solve
this problem so the compilation can contiiue!? do I need to download python?
is there a specific library that I need to download for visual studio? any
help is really appreciated!

Did you turn on PARAVIEW_ENABLE_PYTHON cmake flag? If so, then you'd
need python.

Hi!

No I didn't and that is what I meant by " I didn't check the option for the

Hey Dave,

Mike's patch worked well for me, too. Would you be able to get this into the git head? It's really nice to be able to build on OS X with RPATH OFF without extra (outside CMake) requirements.

I can put this in on the bug tracker if it will help.

Thanks,
-Eric

Yes Please make a bug. I want to make some tweaks to it and should be able
to merge it in the next few days.

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview, Exodus and Gauss Points
Message-ID: <4F65515D-492A-4516-A2CA-E6EC7C8E10DC@tugraz.at>

Hi!

This is my first post here - so please excuse me if I'm off topic.
I plan to use ExodusII as my output file format. I'm aware of the following document regarding to that: http://infoserve.sandia.gov/sand_doc/2007/077169.pdf

This article is rather old, so is there any actual documentation related to multiple cell data, ExodusII and Paraview? The features I found out are not enough for me. For instance it is not possible to show gauss-point data with multiple blocks and different mesh-types.

Thanks a lot!
	Juergen

Lars,

In the current version, stereo is only supported in builtin mode. We
plan to add support for stereo for (at least) cave view in future.

Subject: [Paraview] Plotting Transient data
Message-ID: <4BE32505.4050807@engr.uky.edu>

Hi,

I am trying to plot some transient data on an unstructed mesh using 
paraview.  I've found the thread here that advises writing each 
time-step to a separate file.

http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2007-June/005161.html

This works.  My problem is that (if I am understanding correctly), each 
file has to have the full mesh representation as well as the particular 
time-step data.  For small meshes this is not a problem, but some meshes 
I am looking at are very large.  It seems wasteful to have to re-define 
the mesh in each file.

Is there a way to separate the mesh data from the data sets so that I 
can define the mesh only once in one file and only have the data sets in 
the list of time-step files?

Thanks,
John

I just tried opening the file and saved as a .e file and then opened the .e and did not notice any difference.

What version of paraview is this happening?

Thanks,
Nathan.

Subject: [Paraview] node ordering mismatch when saving vtu as exodus and vice versa

I think there is a mismatch in node ordering when we want to save vtu file as exodus and vice versa for 20-noded hexahedral meshes. This is due to the different node ordering scheme for VTK and exodus for this particular element type.

e.g., if you open an attached vtu file, it is fine. If you save that as .e file and open looks different. That was due the different ordering!

Thanks,
HNG

Hello!
I noticed that Native OpenFOAM Reader (NOF) and foamToVTK  give
different results for the slip boundary condition:  with NOF normal
component of velocity on the boundary is not zero as you can view on
attached fig. Why this happens?

My config is:
	ParaView 3.6.2

"In fact, it would be trivial to change the c++ code to make a 
QMessageBox appear instead of a QLineEdit."

Are you saying that I should submit a feature request for that? A 
QMessageBox would definitely be more helpful than the QLineEdit.

Hi Sergei, D.,

Thanks for reporting. The problem is that the reader only respects
"value" entries of boundaryFields in field files (which the slip
condition does not write out) and does no more complex things such as
calculating tangential component of the velocity vector. Addressing
the issue has long been in my to-do list but will still take some time
until I get it fixed.

I think you can repeat it like this:

create wavelet source
apply append datasets to convert to unstructured grid
save as exodus, then reopen the saved file

Subject: [Paraview] Problem with stereo in v3.8.0
Message-ID: <4BE4262E.4000100@renci.org>

In ParaView 3.6.2 I am able to run ParaView in stereo with paraview 
--stereo, which renders with red-blue stereo.  Then when saving 
screenshots or animations, I can select Left Eye Only stereo mode or 
Right Eye Only stereo mode to generate full-color left-eye and right-eye 
stereo pairs.  This is very useful for creating stereo content for 
playback on passive-stereo systems.

This appears to be broken in ParaView 3.8.0, as trying to save with Left 
Eye Only or Right Eye Only both result in the same red-blue stereo 
image.  Is there another way to achieve the result I want, or should 
this be filed as a bug?  Thanks,

David

Yes, you can use the xdmf format file, and use the XPath,

"XPath, allows for elements in the XML document and the API to  
reference specific elements in a document"
http://www.xdmf.org/index.php/XDMF_Model_and_Format

then if your data is realy big, you can use the hdf5 format inside  
your Xdmf to store the information in binary/compress .





in the example only the topology and geometry of the first timestep is  
written.

Subject: [Paraview] Contours of streamlines crashing
Message-ID: <4BE44236.20104@renci.org>

I have some steady-state vector field data that I am visualizing using 
streamlines and particles via the following pipeline:

Mask Points on the input (~100 points) to generate seeds
Stream Tracer with Custom Source to generate the streamlines
Contour on Integration Time to generate particles, which can then be 
animated by animating the Isosurface value.

This was working fine in v3.6.2, but started crashing in v3.8.0.  
*Note:  The crashing only occurs when the streamline filter output is 
attached to a contour filter.*  After some investigating, I realized 
that part of the problem is with different default values for the Stream 
Tracer in 3.8.0 vs. 3.6.2.  From what I have been able to figure out so 
far, it looks like different values for the Integrator Type (default of 
Runge-Kutta 2 in 3.6.2 and Runge-Kutta 4.5 in 3.8.0) and Initial Step 
Length (default of 0.5 in 3.6.2 and 0.2 in 3.8.0).  After experimenting 
with these values, I have found the following:


Windows 3.6.2 64-bit binaries:  Crashes for any Runge-Kutta with Initial 
Step Size 0.5
                                                 Works for any 
Runge-Kutta with Initial Step Size 0.2

Windows 3.8.0 64-bit binaries:  Crashes for any Runge-Kutta with Initial 
Step Size 0.5,
                                                  Hangs for Runge-Kutta 
4 and 4.5 with Initial Step Size 0.2

Ubuntu Linux 3.6.2 64-bit build:  Crashes for any Runge-Kutta with 
Initial Step Size 0.5,
                                                    Crashes for 
Runge-Kutta 4.5 with Initial Step Size 0.2

Ubuntu Linux 3.8.0 64-bit build:  Crashes for any Runge-Kutta with 
Initial Step Size 0.5,
                                                    Crashes for 
Runge-Kutta 4.5 with Initial Step Size 0.2


The results on Linux seem to be more consistent than on Windows (go 
figure...), and different data sets on Windows seem to have slightly 
differnt behavior, but there certainly seems to be some interaction 
between the initial step size and the integrator type.  I'd be happy to 
log a bug if that is more appropriate than posting to the mailing list.

I take it back.  The string given as an argument to raw_input will be
displayed as regular stdout in the python console, not in the QMessageBox.
It wouldn't be straight forward to capture the string for display in the
message box.  But feel free to make a feature request if you want.

Hi David:

    The streamline integrator sometimes is sensitive to the selection of the
initial step size (which is currently kind of large to incur some issues,
given a complex dataset particularly containing multiple blocks of irregular
boundaries, with some extreme topological structures). Whenever possible,
please use RK-45 (which may not necessarily be slower than RK-2,
particularly when your dataset is not large) and small values for the step
sizes (initial, max) as well as the error threshold.

    In addition, care needs to be taken when using 'Mask points' to select
the seed points. Sometimes many resulting seeds reside exactly on the
boundaries between different blocks. In some rare cases, such seeds may
cause problems when 'OUT-OF-DOMAIN' status is detected by the integrator.

    -Zhanping

Thanks Zhanping.

I'm not sure this answers the question of why it is crashing though, as 
it only happens when the streamline output is connected to a contour 
filter, and happens even when generating what appear to be valid 
streamlines.  I also did some testing, and the behavior appears to be 
independent of whether Mask Points or something else (e.g. SphereSource) 
is used for the seed points...

Hi, All,


I'm new to paraview. Could you anybody kindly provide me some simple
example to see how this software works? we just installed it and want
to test our installation is completed.

BTW, my model is going to be atomistic simulations with hundreds of
millions of atoms. If you can give me one example of visualized work
with atoms, that would be highly appreciated.

Thanks,

AC

I am not able to reproduce a crash using ParaView 3.8RC2. Using the included Python script, you may play the scene for as long as you want. Modify the file name to read your own copy of RectGrid.vtk from the ParaViewData distribution.

run with pvpython, and it will play for ever.

Hi!

So I am a little confused! I read a paper by Utkarsh A. Ayachit and in this
paper he mentioned to clone the repository at
git://github.com/utkarshayachit/ParaView.git to obtain the modified ParaView
source, up to here it is just fine, I can clone the directory just fine.
Then he goes on and and says the "The branding code is on the *Branding
branch*, and a new reference application, called
*paraview_revamed* will be found in *Applications/Client2* that is what I
can NOT find. where is this branding branch exactly and how can I download
the rest of what he is talking about? Does anyone knows?

I looked at   http://github.com/utkarshayachit/ParaView the ParaView code is
there but I didn't see anything called branding branch! Can anyone help me
please!

Best!

Thanks Pat!

I figured it out, I deleted everything, downloaded the source again and
recompiled this time it did not give me an error. I am fairly certain that
last time I didn't check the PARAVIEW_ENABLE_PYTHON because I don't use
Python, the only thing I can see is different this time is that last time I
downloaded the ParaView-3.8.0-SRC1 and this time when I downloaded the
source it was ParaView-3.8.0-SRC2 is there any difference between the two?

Since that time, the branding infrastructure has merged from Utkarsh's
bleeding edge repository mentioned in the paper, into the ParaView
development branch, and then into the 3.8 release of ParaView.

So just follow instructions from www.paraview.org to get the ParaView
source, either 3.8 or current developement from git and use that make
your own custom applications.

In particular, the sample applications mentioned in the presentation
that accompanied the paper are under the Examples/Applications
directory.

Yeah, the RC2 (release candidate 2) has many bug fixes since RC1.  One of
the bugs may have been the cause of your problem- the pvblot plugin uses
python and was enabled even when PARAVIEW_ENABLE_PYTHON was OFF.

Message-ID: <4BE7C9BC.4070306@onera.fr>

Hello

I have just tested the 3.8 RC2 binaries (Linux 64). If some 3.8 RC1 bugs 
have been solved in line charts (points 1 and 2 in my previous mail 
about 3.8 RC1 regression in line chart), it is still impossible to 
change the default "bottom-left" axis system for another system with top 
or right axis.

I have this very simple image file:

The value of the above points correspponds to the intensity/height of
each pixel.

Is it possible to plot the above intensities as a heightmap (surface
in 3D)? Something like this:

when adding more points.

Hi,
Because your data are structured points, I think that the following
pipeline would do the trick:

reader -> Extract Surface -> Warp by Scalar

You have small spacing compared to the height. So be careful of the warp factor.

Subject: [Paraview] Mac branded packaging
Message-ID: <62336B71-2109-4D48-A615-C84E0FFD7CDC@cs.duke.edu>

Hey all,

Packaging of my branded app is working well on Windows and Linux, but I'm trying once again to see if I can get packaging to work on OS X. I'm getting closer (after making sure my scripts were almost a verbatim copy of the PV ones), but I'm confused about a few things -- maybe someone can help get me further and/or clarify. The main difficulty is that I'm trying to not only get my app to run, but give my users access to the PV Python functionality (python shell and "command line tools").

1. When I generate an executable app bundle (either with CPack or with "make install"), the app itself runs fine on a "clean" system, but the Python shell can't find some of the libraries. It looks like a lot of the python-required libraries are not being copied to .app/Contents/Libraries. How can I tell the system that I need all of that stuff bundled, too, when I build a DragNDrop?

2. If I want to distribute a version of the "command line tools" for making batch animations that will recognize all of the plugins I've hard-coded into my branded app, I've been assuming I need to package these binaries (pvpython, etc) based on my branded app build -- Is this true, or do I just need to somehow add my custom plugin libraries to a standard package of the paraview servers executables? 

The problem I have with (2) is that even when I build against a PV built with VTK_USE_RPATH: OFF and my branded app with CMAKE_SKIP_RPATH: ON, I end up with my executables and libraries depending on (the absolute path of) my local Qt installation, so they won't run on other machines. (And, I can't get my branded app to build against a version of PV which has PARAVIEW_BUILD_QT_GUI: OFF.)

Any help would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks,
-Eric

	scale set
Message-ID: <4BE81656.7010107@cea.fr>

Hi,

Testing ParaView-3.8.0-RC2 on Linux x86, 32 bit

When I use a clip filter after having set a transformation z-scale (here 
set at 0.001),
I get a clip tool set at the dimension of the original object.
I would be easier to use if the clipping tool was considering the previous
set of transformation.

See attached image.

Let me know if I have missed something on this topic.

Allowing netCDF CF is a great job. Thank you very much for this effort !

Good point. Just as an FYI, once you apply the clip filter, the result
will still be transformed using the input's transformation.  I've
added  a feature request.
http://paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=10698

BTW, if you used the Transform filter to scale the data itself, before
clipping (instead of using the transform from the display tab), the
clipping place will show up correctly.

Yes, looks like I can't replicate it with RectGrid.vtk either.  However 
I have been able to replicate it with bluntfin.vts...

thanks Utkarsh

The page you suggested cleared some stuff for me!
As David suggested I tried to look at the examples under
Examples\CustomApplications directory in the paraview source. I CMake'd the
examples there such as Clone1&2 and Demo0&1 and tried to run them to see how
they work (That would be a good working example to understand the process
better), the projects compiled just fine but when I tried to run them I got
the following two errors for Clone and Demo respectively:
"pqapplicationcomponents.dll was not found, re-installing the application
may fix this problem"
"pqCore.dll was not found, re-installing the application may fix this
problem"

anyone has any idea what I did wrong here! what are these two dll files?

When you are running on windows, windows expects that all the dlls are
in PATH (or the same location as the exe). You may want to start the
clone executable from a terminal ensuring that you set the PATH
environment variable correctly to point to the dlls under the ParaView
build dir.

I committed some fixes for this in ParaView/VTK master, the commit IDs are
in the bug report notes,

http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=10387

The patch is quite big, and so we will have to wait until the 3.8.2 release
to integrate them (it will be one of the first changes to be merged after
the final tagging for ParaView). So in the short term I will remove those
elements from the display panel for the line charts, and add them back in
once the 3.8 branch has tagged.

It was necessary to refactor quite a lot of the logic in the vtkChartXY
class to deal with effectively having four plots in each chart, manage four
transforms, and sharing axes between the up to four plots. Please let me
know if you experience further issues after applying the changes.

Thanks,

Marcus

Yes, looks like I can't replicate it with RectGrid.vtk either.  However
I have been able to replicate it with bluntfin.vts...

bluntfin.vts works just fine for me. So I can't help unless you tell us with a debugger, where you see a crash. Send your script using the bluntfin.vts file.

Hi Marcus.

Thank you for this answer. I will wait for the 3.8.2 release before 
testing line chart again and I will continue to test other features in 
3.8.0 RC2.

After doing some more digging, it appears this problem is not only
related to temporal collections, but all XDMF/HDF5 files with spatial
collections. If repeatedly open and close a file containing a spatial
collection, Paraview's memory usage gradually increases until it hangs
my machine. I observe this in both 3.6 and 3.8 RC2.

Cheers,
Tobias

As you suggested, I added the dll path (ParaView-3.8.0-bin\bin\Debug) to the
environment variable as well as the Qt path, however when I ran the .exe
file again I got the same error, so I added the dll files manually to the
same directory as the .exe file, at first was asking about some Paraview
dlls and the some Qt dlls (I have both of this added to the use path
enviroment variable!) and then asked form some vtk dlls, the last error
which I can not get passed of is asking for vtkCommon.dll, I added the dll
to the directory and  I got this:

" the procedure entry point ?ComputePointForExtent at vtkStructuredData
@@SAQAH0 at Z could not be located in the dynamic library link vtkCommon.dll"
!!!!!

I run on WinXP SP3,  visual studio 9 2008 and the latest version of Paraview
and Qt

as I mentioned I added all the paths to all this dlls to the user
environment variable but somehow the system does not see this dlls!!!  and
it will be really inconvenient to add all this dlls every time you write a
software and want to run it!

any help is really appreciated!

best
~Sam

Well, unfortunately, the DLL mess is a Windows OS thing. I am not a
regular Windows developer so I cannot tell you exactly how to access
that option, but Visual Studio does have an option somewhere that
allows you to specify the environment in which the application is
running. There you can set the PATH to include the ParaView bin/debug
(or bin/release as the case maybe) and Qt dirs.

You might want to download dependency walker
(http://www.dependencywalker.com/), a handy utility to determine
exactly what dlls are being used/not found etc. Use this to ensure
that correct versions of the dlls are being imported.

I'd refrain from copying over dlls, this often leads to user-related
errors down the line.

As far as the missing symbol error goes, it's possible your program is
accidentally bringing in a mismatched vtkCommon dll. Do you have other
VTK / ParaView builds in your PATH? Use the dependency walker to
ensure that it's using the correct vtkCOmmon (and other) dlls.

Hope that helps.

To set the PATH when debugging from the IDE:

1. Right click the project and select Properties
2. In the tree view on the left select Debugging
3. In the main panel there will be an entry called 'Environment'
4. Set the Path by entering something like:

PATH=C:\Path\To\Something;%PATH%

Hey Sam,

Instead of trying to build those branded applications separately, did you try first to build ParaView with BUILD_EXAMPLES: ON and see if those applications are built correctly and run okay?

I'm not really a Windows developer, either, but I've been able to build Release versions of the Example applications and my own branded app on Windows 7 64-bit. (I run them from the bin/Release directory under my build directory.) I used Qt 4.6.2 that I compiled myself with VS 64-bit compiler, Visual Studio 2008 Pro, CMake 2.8.1 and Python 2.6.

My PATH variable is very minimal, I think only the Qt library entry is used to help configure the ParaView build:

%USERPROFILE%\Programming\qt-everywhere-opensource-src-4.6.2\lib;"C:\Program Files (x86)\CMake 2.8\bin";C:\Python26;C:\Program Files (x86)\VTK\bin

(the VTK part at the end is just so my separate vtk python stuff runs okay)

Sorry to hear you're having so much trouble. All of us run into these strange things sometimes, but just so you know, it should work without any manual copying of libraries, etc.

Good luck,
-Eric

I played around with this some more.  Looks like I *can* replicate it 
with RectGrid2.vtk

I'm using the regular Stream Tracer with a Point Source (not the Custom 
Source version with a Mask Points input), and changing the number of 
points to 10.  Then applying a Contour filter on the Integration Time to 
generate particles.

This works fine for the default settings of the Stream Tracer.  However, 
  if I change the Maximum Error to 1e-10, it crashes (again, only when 
attached to a Contour Filter).

This is beginning to make some sense to me (I think).  Because 
Runge-Kutta 4-5 is an adaptive integrator, the step size is decreased to 
  match the error.

Something similar must have been happening with my other data set, but 
because the scale of the data was different, a different Maximum Error 
was causing the crash.  I think the Contour Filter is having issues when 
individual points on the streamlines are too close together.

I've attached a python trace that works.  However, changing the Maximum 
Error to 1e-10 causes a crash.

Here is the location in the ContourFilter that is causing problems:

#12 0x00007fffe7b66f93 in vtkContourFilter::RequestData (this=0x23f58e0, 
request=0x21ce010, inputVector=0x238cc90, outputVector=0x2387d60)

Dear David and Eric

Thanks for the comments,
Davie:

I added the path to the environment variable in VS and I still have the same
issue. I wrote something like this

PATH=C:\Program Files\CMake 2.6\bin; C:\Qt\4.6.2\bin;C:\Program
Files\ParaView\bin ;%PATH%
this is what I think you meant.

Eric:
I did that already (I mean compiling Paraview with the examples and
BUILD_EXAMPLES: ON) I still get the same error, I almost tried any trick in
the book you can imagine!  the PATH variable in my use environment variable
looks like the flowing:

C:\Program Files\CMake 2.6\bin;
C:\Qt\4.6.2\bin
C:\Program Files\ParaView\bin ;
plus some other stuff not related to paraview, which seems pretty normal to
me, however I got the same errors as before! it does not find the dll files.


I honestly don't know what to do anymore. The only solution I can think of
right now is to switch to Linux operating system instead of windows, and
that doesn't necessarily means that problem would be solved either,


best!

Hey again,

Okay, so I was able to solve #1: There was a cmake variable that wasn't set (i.e. wasn't carried over from the ParaView build) so the bundle-fixing script wasn't looking in the right spot for the Python libraries.

If someone could still help me with the conceptual question in #2 I'd really appreciate it. I would like my users to be able to generate batch animations with pvpython. In my branded app I hard-code my custom plugins into my main window class, and the python shell within PV automatically "knows about" my custom filters, but I'm not clear on what it takes to get pvpython to know about those custom filters, too.

So, sorry this sounds so ignorant, but is it possible to build a version of pvpython that will already have my custom filters built in? Or, will I always have to do an explicit LoadPlugin(), in which case I can just use the standard procedure for packaging the server executables, but also include my custom plugin libraries along with the standard PV ones.

Thanks,
-Eric

I'm getting closer (after making sure my scripts were almost a verbatim copy of the PV ones), but I'm confused about a few things -- maybe someone can help get me further and/or clarify. The main difficulty is that I'm trying to not only get my app to run, but give my users access to the PV Python functionality (python shell and "command line tools").

If I want to distribute a version of the "command line tools" for making batch animations that will recognize all of the plugins I've hard-coded into my branded app, I've been assuming I need to package these binaries (pvpython, etc) based on my branded app build -- Is this true, or do I just need to somehow add my custom plugin libraries to a standard package of the paraview servers executables?

(And, I can't get my branded app to build against a version of PV which has PARAVIEW_BUILD_QT_GUI: OFF.)

Hey Sam,

Maybe this won't make a difference (and I don't remember where I saw to do this), but you have your PATH set to the Qt bin directory rather than the lib directory. I have some notes saying I had trouble unless the lib directory was in my PATH...

Eric,

You are correct, there's no way for pvpython/pvbatch to know about
your plugins currently, nor is there a way to create "custom pvbatch
or pvpython" executables. You will have to do an explicit LoadPlugin()
in your python scripts.

Thanks eric


I  added the Qt lib path to the PATH too but it didn't really make any
difference either! I am just installing netbeans on the linux system I have
here to see if I can compile and run paraview and the examples, it might
work I don't know!

best!

What do you mean by it does not work? Missing DLLs still? Did you try
running the dependency walker to determine which dlls are missing?
Ensure that your PATH has those missing dlls.

Subject: [Paraview] git cmake error
Message-ID: <9e63c5c5e0143b616442a7d7b63b1096@cs.utah.edu>

I'm getting the following cmake error when trying to compile from the new
git repository:
"
 CMake Error at Utilities/VTKClientServer/vtkClientServer.cmake:16
(INCLUDE):
   include could not find load file:

    
/home/carson/svn/ParaView/build/Utilities/Xdmf2/vtk/Utilities/vtkXdmfKit.cmake
 Call Stack (most recent call first):
   Utilities/VTKClientServer/vtkClientServer.cmake:37 (PV_PRE_WRAP_VTK_CS)
   Utilities/VTKClientServer/Xdmf2/CMakeLists.txt:7 (PV_WRAP_VTK_CS)
"

I have done a find on vtkXdmfKit.cmake and it doesn't exist anywhere.  It
also is not in that directory through the webgit listing.  Is this a
missing file or did I clone the git repository or it's dependencies
incorrectly somehow?
thanks,
Carson

Hey Utkarsh,

Thanks for clearing that up for me. At least that makes it easier to get rid of the Qt dependencies I was running into -- I can just focus on modified server executables packaging which will include my plugin libraries.

Talk to you later,
-Eric

Message-ID: <223aef.c931.1288b132b7d.Coremail.weaponfire2005@163.com>

Hi:
    I use a .xmf file to read HDF5 raw data. I find that the volume represention option would be not active when I use "Collection Grid".  Volume represention can be used until I remove the "Collection Grid". Does this mean that paraview can't volume render multi-block data? or I write a wrong xmf file? Thanks for you help:)
 
the following is my xmf file:

Subject: [Paraview] About 2D Glyph orientation
Message-ID: <AANLkTilFOV7fQR1Gy6wB7ISb3L0ImiaFnc6IqJIdmnTC@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I am new to Paraview and I could not find any clear information on how 2D
glyphs are oriented. Is there a way to control their normals to the the 2D
plane?

Here is the code I use to generate a cloud of points from a text file to
which I would like to assign different filters (it can be 3D or 2D, but
circles oriented by their normals would be perfect...)

/// here is the part to recover the data
std::ifstream file ("cracks.txt",std::ios::in);
        if(file){
             while ( !file.eof() ){
                std::string line;
                Real p0,p1,p2,s,o0,o1,o2;
                while ( std::getline(file, line) ){
                    file >> p0 >> p1 >> p2 >> s >> o0 >> o1 >> o2;
                    vtkIdType pid[1];
                    pid[0] = crackPos->InsertNextPoint(p0, p1, p2);
                    crackCells->InsertNextCell(1,pid);
                    crackSize->InsertNextValue(s);
                    float n[3] = { o0,o1,o2 };
                    crackOri->InsertNextTupleValue(n);
                }
             }
             file.close();
}

/// here is the code to create the VTK file
vtkSmartPointer<vtkUnstructuredGrid> crackUg =
vtkSmartPointer<vtkUnstructuredGrid>::New();
crackUg->SetPoints(crackPos);
crackUg->SetCells(VTK_VERTEX, crackCells);
crackUg->GetPointData()->AddArray(crackSize);
crackUg->GetPointData()->AddArray(crackOri);

vtkSmartPointer<vtkXMLUnstructuredGridWriter> writer =
vtkSmartPointer<vtkXMLUnstructuredGridWriter>::New();
string
fn=fileName+"cracks."+lexical_cast<string>scene->currentIteration)+".vtu";
writer->SetFileName(fn.c_str());
writer->SetInput(crackUg);
writer->Write();

Do you have any advice?

Tahnks a lot in advance

Hi,

I would like to build the python dependencies for 64 bit windows.  Does
anyone have a build script for this?  It's not an easy task!  I'm using
MSVS9 and Intel Fortran.

Any help would be appreciated,

Hey Paul,

I don't have that much experience with Windows, but I was able to get ParaView to build with Python functionality on Windows 7 64-bit (Visual Studio 2008) using the pre-compiled Python 2.6.5 from python.org:

http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.6.5/python-2.6.5.amd64.msi

along with numpy from:

http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/

Hopefully someone else has notes if you really need to build it yourself, but this worked for me.

Hey Luc,

If I understand you correctly, you want 2D glyphs on your points, but you want them oriented according to the normal vectors you've read from your file?

If you apply the Glyph filter to your data set, and then choose 2D Glyph from the Glyph Type combo-box, then you can set the type of 2d glyphs to Circle. If you want them to be oriented by the normals you've calculated, then just make sure the Orient check-box is checked, and your normals are chosen in the Vectors combo-box. I'll attach an example screen shot of the output so you can see if this is what you're looking for. (Note, I've also checked Filled to fill in the circles, but this isn't necessary.)

If I'm misunderstanding your question, feel free to rephrase it and we'll try again. :)

-Eric

Subject: [Paraview] Too many open files
Message-ID: <AANLkTild7JVz63DwnVbZL24cEReNe4vf5epAGvdVMYBW@mail.gmail.com>

I have data for 630 time steps in EnSight format.  When I try to play the
data I get that there are too many open files (nothing after time step 509
is displayed).  Is there something I can change in Windows or ParaView to
allow more open files?  Since I currently have each time step data in its
own file, can I write all the data to a single file?  Or do the files need
to stay open after they have been read?

Thanks,

Message-ID: <A053886D-1737-433D-ACAF-483E95FD5F90@gmail.com>

Is there a file format for Paraview that stores diffs rather than data  
for the whole model?  Right now I use a PVD file with many VTP files  
representing a time series. However, muh of the data between VTP files  
is identical.  Is there a format that will conserve space by looking  
only at the differences between two timesteps (this is how svn works  
for instance)?

Thank you Eric, but I was probably not as clear as I thought. I have already
seen that a 2D glyphs can be oriented given a defined vector, but, actually,
I was wondering if we can make the 2D plane perpendicular/normal to this
vector, as in the attached picture.

Hope it is clearer now

Regards

Message-ID: <5861C625258167499D051F0CE1D0FE4B02F9E5DA@GLKMS2104.GREENLNK.NET>

Hi all,
 
I'm learning to integrate existing VTK filters into Paraview as plugins
through the info found at http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Plugin_HowTo.
I'd like to do the same for the vtkSelectVisiblePoints filter but am
having trouble.  The filter requires both a dataset (the easy bit!) and
a renderer (the hard bit!).  I have been unable to find any information
on how to pass the existing ParaView renderer to a filter within the
ServerManagerConfiguration xml.
 
Any help would be great!
 
Many Thanks,
 
Duncan Johnson

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview 3.8 RC2 makes the whole X restart
Message-ID: <001501caf288$46d070e0$d47152a0$@dubsky@gcsc.uni-frankfurt.de>

Dear all,

I have the following problem with Paraview 3.8 RC2. Actually the problem
already appeared with the version 3.7 which I built from source. However, as
it was a development version, I thought there might be still some bugs. But
the 3.8 RC2 which I've installed just today behaves the same.

So the problem is the following: After a few minutes (can really reach from
~30 seconds to ~20 minutes) of working with Paraview suddenly my whole Linux
session restarts and I have to login again. Of course by this I lose all the
opened applications (not just Paraview), which is pretty bad.

There's no real way, how to exactly reproduce the problem. I mean the time
when the crash occurs seems more or less random. But after max ~30 mins of
working with Paraview, you can be almost sure it crashes.

The only thing I can say is, that if I just leave Paraview minimized and do
something else, the crash doesn't occur. Thus it really happens only if you
actively do something in Paraview.

I'm using CentOS 5.5.

Are there any logs or error messages you could help to analyze the situation
more? I'm not sure where I could find something relevant.

 

Regards

 

Josef

Hey Luc,

Ah, I see. I'd actually never looked at which way the 2D glyphs are oriented. Interesting.

So with a slightly more complicated pipeline you can do it. From Sources create a 2D Glyph source. Apply a Transform filter to that, which only has a rotation of 90 degrees around the Y-axis. Then from your data, apply the Glyph With Custom Source filter, and when it pops up the dialog for choosing each, choose your data for Input and the Transform filter for Source.

Seems like there should be an easier way of doing this, but it works. (see screen shot)

Talk to you later,
-Eric

Hi Paul,

Thanks for your hint, but I do have enough disk space (~10 GB). I've already
tried to look in /var/log/ but didn't really find anything suspicious.

The strange thing is that it never happened with 3.6.2 or 3.6.1. The problem
started to appear as of 3.7 (which I compiled from source) and remains also
for 3.8 RC2 too

A thought - do you have enough disk space? I am using 3.8 RC1/2 on Centos
5.5 with no issues. However I have noticed that if you run out of disk
space, you get no warning and the session just crashes. Maybe ParaView is
generating some file (swap?) that pushes your system to the limit of disk.

 

I am not sure how to debug ParaView (yet) so I don't know if there is
anything in the /var/log directory to look for.

Any chance you have a GL driver issue? Was your driver updated recently? 
Can you *still* run 3.6.2 without problems?

I can view 500 time steps.  My problem is when it goes to time step 509.  My
guess is that there is a limit of 512 open files somewhere.

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview and Multicore
Message-ID: <20100513110632.0296999e@grisu>

Hi all,

I have succesfully compiled Paraview with MPI support on my
Workstation (Quad Core). I have read that paraview runs serial,
pvserver parallel, so I started the server by mpirun -np 4 pvserver and
connected through X. Everything seems to work fine.

But there are two strange behaviours I have noticed:

1. CPU usage on workstation is almost 100% on three of the four cores
although no client is connected (when I type mpirun -np 3 pvserver there
are 2 out of 4 running at 100%; with -np 2 only 1). I have noticed this
using MPICH2 and OpenMPI.

2. When I now start a client process the server uses only one core (-np
4/3/2/1). Why?

Does MPI not work on multicore systems as on multiprocessor systems or
is this a Paraview issue?

Thanks,
Guido

For windows _setmaxstdio<http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/6e3b887c(v=vs.71).aspx>
could
be the solution to allow more than 512 open files per process.

The web page with the build details, http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView_Binaries , seems to be a bit out of date:

- In the 3.8.0 section, most of the entries are labeled as 3.6.2, for example "paraview-3.6.2-Linux64-x86.tar.gz".  I think this is probably a case of mis-labelling, since the details listed are different than those listed for "paraview-3.6.2-Linux64-x86.tar.gz" in the 3.6.2 section for example.

- Build details for ParaView-3.8.0-RC2-Darwin-x86_64.dmg are absent, although it is available from the download page.

One additional detail that would be handy to know for the OS-X builds:  Whether the Qt version used was built with Carbon or Cocoa.  Nokia offers both as binary downloads.  The Carbon build is 32 bit only, so presumably it is the Carbon version of Qt for ParaView-3.8.0-RC2-Darwin-Universal.dmg and the Cocoa version of Qt for ParaView-3.8.0-RC2-Darwin-x86_64.dmg , but it would be nice not to have to guess.

The question about why the pvserver processes are always at 100% CPU comes up frequently on the mailing list (such as http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2008-December/010338.html).  I've added some information to the Wiki about it to provide an explanation: http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Setting_up_a_ParaView_Server#Server_processes_always_have_100.25_CPU_usage

Hi all,

I have succesfully compiled Paraview with MPI support on my
Workstation (Quad Core). I have read that paraview runs serial,
pvserver parallel, so I started the server by mpirun -np 4 pvserver and
connected through X. Everything seems to work fine.

But there are two strange behaviours I have noticed:

1. CPU usage on workstation is almost 100% on three of the four cores
although no client is connected (when I type mpirun -np 3 pvserver there
are 2 out of 4 running at 100%; with -np 2 only 1). I have noticed this
using MPICH2 and OpenMPI.

2. When I now start a client process the server uses only one core (-np
4/3/2/1). Why?

Does MPI not work on multicore systems as on multiprocessor systems or
is this a Paraview issue?

Thanks,
Guido

Can someone give an update on when the 3.8.0 release will happen? I know that a lot of people are working out bugs in the release candidate to make a better product. It's just that I got the impression (from this list) that in early April the release would be imminent.

Are we a day away, a week, a month?

Hi Greg, things have calmed down as far as bug reports are concerned. I was
going to make the binaries earlier this week but I got side tracked to
another project. To answer your question, we are days away.

Thanks Ken, but I have already read this thread, therefore I started the
client process anyway without taking care of cpu usage for now.

However my second question still keeps me busy. Isn't it possible to
use all 4 cores?

I am afraid I simply don't understand the question.  You said in (1) that you have three cores running at 100%.  Then in (2) you said that you only have one core running.  Is it happening when you start the client, connect the client to the server, launch the server from the client, or something else?  Is something running or is the client sitting idle waiting for the user?

Well if I start pvserver by mpirun -np 4 pvserver I have 3 cores running
at almost 100%. Now I connect to the server and start a Delaunay 2D
calculation on one of my datasets. As a result all of the 4 cores are
showing 100%. However I assume that there is only one core doing the
job, because on the one hand calculation is really slow. I have done
similar processing on an other PC (an outdated one) and there is no
significant performance advantage as one would expect.
And on the other hand, running pvserver with e.g. -np 2 results in 100%
for 2 CPUs when starting the Delaunay 2D calc (1 core at 100% when
cpu is idle).

Hi Ken,

Sorry for the slow reply.  What I have is a reader for poly files
(vtkPolyReader*) and a GMS mesh reader which I believe has the 3dm file
extension.  Hope this helps.

Does ParaView itself work for you at all?

Ah, I see.  It sounds like your data is not balanced.  Many of the "non parallel" file formats will do something stupid when loading data in parallel.  For example, they might load everything on process 0 or load everything everywhere.  (And now that I think about it, the Delaunay filter may have trouble in parallel.)

Try running the "Process Id Scalars" filter on your data.  Do the points look evenly distributed?

Well if I start pvserver by mpirun -np 4 pvserver I have 3 cores running
at almost 100%. Now I connect to the server and start a Delaunay 2D
calculation on one of my datasets. As a result all of the 4 cores are
showing 100%. However I assume that there is only one core doing the
job, because on the one hand calculation is really slow. I have done
similar processing on an other PC (an outdated one) and there is no
significant performance advantage as one would expect.
And on the other hand, running pvserver with e.g. -np 2 results in 100%
for 2 CPUs when starting the Delaunay 2D calc (1 core at 100% when
cpu is idle).

Another thought - just try the precompiled RC2 binaries and see what the
difference is.

I also agree with checking the driver, the last issue I had was caused by
this (an upgrade fixed it).

For the list - are there any debug options that make ParaView print/log what
it is doing? E.g. export DEBUG_INFO=TRUE 

There seems to be a few instances like this where something goes wrong and
there is no information. Even if there isn't ParaView should make use of the
QStatusBar to give some hints.
 
Cheers,

Paul

Any chance you have a GL driver issue? Was your driver updated recently? 
Can you *still* run 3.6.2 without problems?

Process Id Scalars didn't do the trick, still no performance gain with
Delaunay 2D.
My data is stored in a h5 file which gets loaded through a xdmf file.
After running the Process Id Scalars filter I do not see any changes in
the distribution of the data. However I guess that they are
already "evenly distributed" by default. 

So maybe exporting the file to an other format will do it or is there a
problem with the Delaunay implementation in general when running in
parallel?

Process Id Scalars doesn't do any load balancing, it just shows what cells
are assigned to what process.  You can try the D3 filter to do actual
load-balancing (your reader may already be doing this though in which case
you would see the same results from a Process Id Scalars filter used after
the D3 filter).  I'm not that familiar with the internals of Delauney2D for
distributed points but it's quite possible that for the set of points you
have that the partitioning is not appropriate.  As Ken said, using the
Process Id Scalars to see if the input is fairly well balanced.

Excellent!

This is exactly what I needed even if it is not really direct though... Does
someone know if there is a way to "automatize" this procedure, as with a
custom glyph? I tried to make a Custom Glyph but without any success
(probably missed all the steps necessary for such a combination). Or maybe I
could include the rotation of 90 degrees around Y-axis during the recording
of my data...

Cheers

Subject: [Paraview] Minimal X Window System config
Message-ID: <8B422C7AF4964D898BE599D18E8AD5B5@notebook>

Hi All,

Does any one have information they can share on a minimal X Window System
config (Centos 5.5 cluster nodes) for pvserver remote rendering to work?

I can install a very minimal system consisting of things like fonts,
xorg-x11-twm, glx-utils, xorg-x11-server-Xorg, xorg-x11-twm, xorg-x11-xinit,
xorg-x11-server-Xorg and xorg-x11-xauth.

If I run Specviewperf, glxgears or glxinfo the output is as expected.
However pvserver just hangs when I connect to it from a client. The weird
thing is that if I run pvserver or ParaView via VirtualGL in a TurboVNC
session it works!?

My solution at the moment works but is big bang and overkill for a cluster
node:

yum groupinstall "X Window System" "GNOME Desktop Environment"

Note I have read the following:

Setting up a ParaView Server
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Setting_up_a_ParaView_Server

Step by step guide for the installation and configuration of a cluster to
run ParaView

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview 3.8.0 crash in Edit Color Map
Message-ID: <4BECE7D8.3030108@uq.edu.au>

Hi list,

I just compiled Paraview 3.8.0 RC2 and found a reproducible crash 
whenever I click on "Edit Color Map".
Version 3.6.2 compiled with exactly the same dependencies (mesa, mpi, 
qt) does not exhibit this crash.

Configuration details:
Linux 2.6.27.45-0.1 SMP x86_64
Qt 4.6.2, Mesa 7.8.1, MPT 2.00
Mesa built with off-screen support

I created the stack trace below and found this suspicious value:
(gdb) print ctx->DrawBuffer
$2 = (GLframebuffer *) 0xefefef00efefef

Stack trace:

Subject: [Paraview] Problem changing InputFile property of CVSReader
Message-ID: <OF41ACD45B.C462D0F4-ONC1257723.002B39F0-C1257723.002B3A11@tororosso.com>



Hi all,
I have saved the state of a pipeline diffCP.pvsm where I have to two
CVSReader then two table to point, a delaunay2d, a resample and a
ProgrammableFilter to do the diff.
In the sample code attached below Im trying to change the two input file
name used in the CVSReader (Input1, Input2) and then run the pipeline to
get an immage.

But when I run this script the produced png is always referring to the
original two input files that where stored in the pvsm file no matter what
I put in inputFile1 or inputFile2. It's like if the InputFile property
doesn't get updated by my code.

I tried the code with both 3.6.2 and the trunk CVS of ~20 days ago.

Am I missing something?


Thanks for your help,
Luca

-------------------------------------------------------------------
servermanager.Connect()
servermanager.LoadState("diffCP.pvsm")
pm = servermanager.ProxyManager()
#changing input1 and input2 fileNames
for (pName, pId), pObject in pm.GetProxiesInGroup("sources").iteritems():
    if (pName == "Input1"):
        print "setting Input1 from " + str(pObject.FileName) + " to " +
        inputFile1
        pObject.FileName=inputFile1
        pObject.FileNameInfo=inputFile1
        pObject.UpdateProperty("FileName")
        pObject.UpdateProperty("FileNameInfo")
        #pObject.UpdatePipelineInformation
    elif (pName == "Input2"):
        print "setting Input2 from " + str(pObject.FileName) + " to " +
        inputFile2
        pObject.FileName=inputFile2
        pObject.FileNameInfo=inputFile2
        pObject.UpdateProperty("FileName")
        pObject.UpdateProperty("FileNameInfo")

view.StillRender()

You might find some clues in the /var/log/Xorg.0.log and Xorg.0.log.old

As far has glx, I'd still update/downgrade the OpenGL driver even just to
rule that out.

Well, I can confirm the problem doesn't occur with 3.6.2 (using the
precompiled vision, downloaded directly from the web). However the 3.8 RC2
(also the precompiled version from the web) does crash after some time
exactly as the 3.7CVS does.
So I think this shouldn't be a glx issue, right?

Another thought - just try the precompiled RC2 binaries and see what the
difference is.

I also agree with checking the driver, the last issue I had was caused by
this (an upgrade fixed it).

For the list - are there any debug options that make ParaView print/log what
it is doing? E.g. export DEBUG_INFO=TRUE 

There seems to be a few instances like this where something goes wrong and
there is no information. Even if there isn't ParaView should make use of the
QStatusBar to give some hints.

Paul

Any chance you have a GL driver issue? Was your driver updated recently? 
Can you *still* run 3.6.2 without problems?

Hi,
Ok, so this is what I found in the Xorg.0.log file:

So you think it might be GL problem after all? I don't have much experience
with that. The strange thing is it really never happens with the 3.6.2
version.
The bad thing for me is, that I cannot really experiment with the driver, as
I'm using VMware. (I fully aware of the fact that I lose on performance, but
the flexibility that VMware offers me is more valuable in my situation and
also my models are really small).

You might find some clues in the /var/log/Xorg.0.log and Xorg.0.log.old

As far has glx, I'd still update/downgrade the OpenGL driver even just to
rule that out.

Well, I can confirm the problem doesn't occur with 3.6.2 (using the
precompiled vision, downloaded directly from the web). However the 3.8 RC2
(also the precompiled version from the web) does crash after some time
exactly as the 3.7CVS does.
So I think this shouldn't be a glx issue, right?

Another thought - just try the precompiled RC2 binaries and see what the
difference is.

I also agree with checking the driver, the last issue I had was caused by
this (an upgrade fixed it).

For the list - are there any debug options that make ParaView print/log what
it is doing? E.g. export DEBUG_INFO=TRUE 

There seems to be a few instances like this where something goes wrong and
there is no information. Even if there isn't ParaView should make use of the
QStatusBar to give some hints.
 
Cheers,

Paul

Any chance you have a GL driver issue? Was your driver updated recently? 
Can you *still* run 3.6.2 without problems?

On Thursday, I was debugging an issue between 3.6.2, 3.8.0RC2 and the 
3.9.0 development tree.    My version of Paraview built against the GL 
libraries (not Mesa) and the command "pvbatch --use-offscreen-rendering" 
worked using 3.6.2 and 3.9.0, but failed against 3.8.0RC1 and RC2.    
There were a couple of error messages pointing to the GL libraries, so I 
upgraded my nVidia driver, and the problem went away.  Does it make 
sense - no.   But, sometimes, you just go with whatever works ......

Hey Luc,

One option you have with many things like this is, once you create your complicated filter you can create a "custom filter" out of it, and just expose the parameters you need to adjust. I'll attach an example (where all I exposed was the glyph type and filled/not -- I'm sure in a real use case you'd also want to expose the scaling factor, etc). 

To load this go to Tools->Manage Custom Filters and click Import. To create one you highlight all of the elements you want to include and then go to Tools->Create Custom Filter. Here's a page the might get you started:

http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Custom_Filters

Good luck,
-Eric

This is still NOT working on the latest pull of the "release" branch  
of ParaView. I can NOT simply do a "make install" on OS X and have my  
custom plugins copied into the Application Bundle along with any other  
plugins that are included with ParaView.

Hi Mike,

Do you mind trying to print some messages then? When you
call ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN the plugin gets Appended to PARAVIEW_PLUGINLIST and
also install rules should be created. Can you add this line say in
Applications\ParaView\CMakeLists.txt and then configure and see if you're
plugins get printed in the list of plugins?

message("PARAVIEW_PLUGINLIST ${PARAVIEW_PLUGINLIST}")

Subject: [Paraview] SILO reader
Message-ID: <4BED7A51.3040203@tacc.utexas.edu>

Hey, y'all -

Anyone know much about the silo reader?  I have a multimesh with 256 
parts, and I'm running in parallel - as many as 256 processes.  
Unfortunately, it bombs out in the reader with a message that there are 
too many files open and, sure enough, each node seems to be holding 
every part file open, and silo by default hits a limit at 256 (256 parts 
+ the multimesh file, I suppose).  I changed silo to allow 512 open 
files, and that works in my case, but does each process  *have* to hold 
all the files open?

Greg

Hi Greg,

You're talking about the vtkSiloReader in paraview, or the visit silo reader
via the visit bridge?

Message-ID: <AANLkTiksFw3KaoZ-s2-38Z-8go86vcUFCAJU2wEsn333@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am new to Paraview and trying to wade my way through the Paraview sources,
examples and doxygen to figure out how to programatically connect to a
server, create a simple pipeline and display the result of its execution in
a client.

I would really appreciate if someone could point out where to find a simple
example that would demonstrate how to construct a data/rendering pipeline
consisting of a source, a filter, a mapper, an actor, a renderer, and a
render window with the Paraview API.

Thank you,
Jenya Burstein

I've never used PARAVIEW_EXTRA_EXTERNAL_MODULES before but what I have
figured out was to set it to PVMXADataModel and place your git repository
adjacent to my ParaView source directory. When I do this I get these
configure errors.

CMake Error at
C:/Kitware/ParaView/PVMXADataModel/PVMXADataModelParaViewImport.cmake:39
(INCLUDE):

 include could not find load file:

C:/Kitware/ParaView/PVMXADataModel/Resources/CMake/ParaViewPluginIncludeMXADataModel.cmake

I don't see these in the Repository. Are they missing from where I cloned
from?

Ok,
   So here is the problem. The PARAVIEW_EXTRA_EXTERNAL_MODULES is  
called in the top level ParaView CMakeLists.txt file. AFTER that call  
the line:
SET(PARAVIEW_PLUGINLIST "" CACHE INTERNAL "List of configured plugins"  
FORCE)

is called which wipes out any plugins that were added by External  
Modules. So one needs to initialize the PARAVIEW_PLUGINLIST BEFORE the  
line:

INCLUDE(ParaViewCommon)

is executed:

But that still didn't work but is probably part of the problem

Subject: [Paraview] Full Recompile after running Cmake in 3.8 Release
	Candidate
Message-ID: <6BEFE588-35BF-4637-9E8F-0E3F0DC3B301@bluequartz.net>

Not really sure what is going on (Maybe it is my setup) but every time  
I run cmake to simply turn on or off a plugin, a full recompile is  
performed which kind of slows down development a bit. I am assuming  
some file is getting regenerated (like a header or include file) which  
then forces all the dependencies to be recompiled? Is anyone else  
seeing this?

Thanks for any sanity check. (My sanity that is.. )

There is another cmake variable "BUILD_PARAVIEW_PLUGINLIST" which  
needs to be enabled in the *ParaViewImport.cmake file. I added SET  
(BUILD_PARAVIEW_PLUGINLIST ON) to my  
PVMXADataModelParaViewImport.cmake file (and with the other  
corrections) I now can do a "make install" and have ParaView.app  
include my plugins. So where should I send a patch?

   Now.. if I could only convince "make install" to actually install  
ParaView.app where I want that would be great. No Write privs in / 
Applications.

Cool okay! Can you make a proper git patch against Master and send it to the
list? I will apply it and cherry pick it into the list.

Subject: [Paraview] request help with plugin and line widget
Message-ID: <4BF0D0E70200008E000367B8@groupwise.hpc.msstate.edu>

I am new to ParaView plugins and would really appreciate help with a task.

I want to read a structured grid file and probe the grid with a line, almost identical to ParaView's Plot Over Line filter. 
This new filter needs to generate a particular meteorology plot called "Skew T Log P" rather than an XY plot, otherwise I would just use Plot Over Line.

The ability of Plot Over Line to interactively move the line is a very nice feature that I'd like to have as well.

I've tried two approaches, but have encountered problems with both, and that's the reason for this request.

First approach was to try to find the source for Plot Over Line but I wasn't able to find that and modify the plot output.

Second approach was to try pqLineWidget to realize an interactive line for the probe, but I'm currently not able to make that work, either.  Example code successfully incorporating pqLineWidget would be very helpful.

Any help or thoughts would be much appreciated. 

I'm working with ParaView 3.6.2, Windows XP, and MSVC 2008.

Subject: [Paraview] request help with plugin and line widget
In-Reply-To: <4BF0D0E70200008E000367B8@groupwise.hpc.msstate.edu>

In  ParaViewSource/Servers/ServerManager/Resources/filters.xml ,
there's a proxy named "ProbeLine" under the "filters" group. (You can
directly refer to the ProbeLine filter under the "internal_filters"
group, just to make it easier to understand). That's the XML for the
"Plot Over Line" filter. You want to model your XML on that. You don't
need to directly deal with pqLineWidget. The trick is the following
property:

 <InputProperty
        name="Source"
        command="SetInputConnection"
        label="Probe Type">
           <ProxyGroupDomain name="groups">
             <Group name="sources"/>
           </ProxyGroupDomain>
           <ProxyListDomain name="proxy_list">
             <Proxy group="extended_sources" name="HighResLineSource" />
           </ProxyListDomain>
           <Documentation>
             This property specifies the dataset whose geometry will
be used in determining positions to probe.
           </Documentation>
    </InputProperty>

This refers to "HighResLineSource". Now if you open utilities.xml at
the same location, you'll find the xml for HighResLineSource that has
some XML in <Hints/> section that defines that the line widget is to
be used.

Jenya,


Before answering this question, may I ask what type of application you
are trying to create? The question is, is it a Qt-based application at
all? Or a pure client-server C++ application.

That is the first change. The issue with BUILD_PARAVIEW_PLUGINLIST I  
am not sure where that should properly be enabled. Currently it is  
enabled in ParaView/Plugins/CMakeLists.txt at the top of the file. If  
someone uses the PARAVIEW_EXTRA_EXTERNAL_MODULES I don't think the  
BUILD_PARAVIEW_PLUGINLIST gets enabled in the proper sequence. So I  
guess it comes down to is it the responsibility of the programmer to  
enable it or should it get enabled if the ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN is  
called which would cover all the bases?

That is correct, currently, we do not support volume rendering of
multi-block datasets for uniform, rectilinear grids. Note that volume
rendering on multiblocks is supported for unstructured-grids (only one
block at a time, however).

Where do I put that?  I'm using Windows XP which I think allows a maximum of
2048 open files.  So I assume I need to put this in the ParaView code.  I'm
also wondering if there is a reason why the files need to stay open.  It
would be a lot nicer if I could close the files instead of leaving them
open, then it wouldn't matter how many time steps I have.

Thanks,

Carolyn

Hello Utkarsh,

It is a Qt-based application. I did notice that there is the pqXXX family of
classes that appear to be wrapping some of the lower level vtkSMXXX
responsibilities.

However, I wonder if we could get away by simply using the pqXXX layer
considering that we may want to use some custom implementations for things
like widget representations, executives, interactors, etc. As I understand
it, pqRendererView encapsulates the mapper, actor and a renderer.
It isn't apparent to me yet how one would go about installing a custom
interactor, for example.

I really appreciate your assistance,
Jenya

Yes the ParaView Works perfectly fine!
However I fixed the problem and now I can compile the examples!! I think
there was two things caused this issue

   1. as you mentioned I had the compiled and binary of Paraview (Two
   different versions) both installed on the my computer which I think created
   some kind of conflicts there, I deleted all the versions and compiled the
   latest version.
   2. The second issue was the Path variable issue with Qt (as Eric
   mentioned) I added the Qt/lib to the path and also added the bin,lib and
   include to Visual Studio and just rebooted the computer, worked perfectly
   fine.

Thanks for your help though! really appreciated.


Kind Regards
~sam

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView 3.8.0-rc2: segfault in libXdmf.so
Message-ID: <4BF26446.7030802@gmx.de>

Hi,

using the following xdmf-file (see attachment) ParaView 3.8.0-rc2
segfaults in libXdmf.so (see backtrace).
(tested with binary-package paraview-3.6.2-Linux64-x86.tar.gz from webpage)

I can visualize the data without any problems using ParaView 3.6.2.

Hope this helps...

Greetings
Jens

Dear Jens and whom it may concern,

Since I faced the same problem, I had debugged it.
I made a patch and I sent it to XDMF group, but no action has been taken.

The patch is really simple. So you can also modify yourself and compile it.

P.S. I actually sent you a similar email from XDMF mailing list....

Thank you,
Kenji Takizawa

Subject: [Paraview] request help with plugin and line widget
Message-ID: <4BF2415B0200008E0003689A@groupwise.hpc.msstate.edu>

Utkarsh,

Your directions allowed me to use a copy of the xml for "Plot Over Line" to duplicate that filter.  Appreciate your description of the xml and where to find it.

Next I'm off to work on modifying the plot portion of the filter.

Thanks!

               Phil

In  ParaViewSource/Servers/ServerManager/Resources/filters.xml ,
there's a proxy named "ProbeLine" under the "filters" group. (You can
directly refer to the ProbeLine filter under the "internal_filters"
group, just to make it easier to understand). That's the XML for the
"Plot Over Line" filter. You want to model your XML on that. You don't
need to directly deal with pqLineWidget. The trick is the following
property:

 <InputProperty
        name="Source"
        command="SetInputConnection"
        label="Probe Type">
           <ProxyGroupDomain name="groups">
             <Group name="sources"/>
           </ProxyGroupDomain>
           <ProxyListDomain name="proxy_list">
             <Proxy group="extended_sources" name="HighResLineSource" />
           </ProxyListDomain>
           <Documentation>
             This property specifies the dataset whose geometry will
be used in determining positions to probe.
           </Documentation>
    </InputProperty>

This refers to "HighResLineSource". Now if you open utilities.xml at
the same location, you'll find the xml for HighResLineSource that has
some XML in <Hints/> section that defines that the line widget is to
be used.

I patched this in the Xdmf trunk yesterday.  I am not sure who has the
authority to commit the change to the ParaView RC.

Can anyone confirm/deny?

Subject: [Paraview] how to record an animation in 3.6.2?
Message-ID: <20100518132619.GA10597@mech-cluster241.men.bris.ac.uk>

I've a 3D binary file which I can view in paraview 3.6.2 fine.
There's no time history in the model.

I'd like to record (create) a keyframe animation, but can't see
how to do this.

I've tried to follow
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView:AnimationTutorial

but can't get the menus the tutorial refers to.
Perhaps 3.6.2 is out of date? Or maybe the tutorial is outdated?

Just to explain better what I'd like (based on my keyframe
experience with Ensight) - I'd like to manually create frames
with the desired rotation/magnification/translucency, etc.
and record them one after another. Then to sync them with some
time measure.

Am I missing something very simple?

many thanks
anton

Subject: [Paraview] extracting the surface between filters
Message-ID: <OF089FD816.544590B4-ONC1257727.004B15B8-C1257727.004B7E79@notes.edfgdf.fr>

Hi all,

I am seeing a bug recently that is puzzling me : 
It seems that the surface of the datasets is extracted between two 
filters.

For instance, I setup the following pipeline : 
reader -> shrink

The first time this is executed, I see the shrink of the border cells. 
If I do the following manipulation 
*mofidy any parameter in the reader, 
*unmodify this parameter 
*and click on apply
(the result being that no change is actually sent to the server, which I 
can check because the RequestData method is not called again in the 
reader), 

then the shrink filter is refreshed and gives me the good output (the 
internal cells shrinked).
Has anybody else seen this?

Stephane

Hm,

git pull

and compiled again but got the same error. Is that not right right
command to update everything?

Thanks,

What did you pull? ParaView? VTK?

If your VTK is inside paraview then do this:

$ cd ParaView
$ git submodule update --recursive

Ah yes, I forgot VTK isn't directly included when updating Paraview anymore.

I tried this:
[doriad at daviddoria ParaView]$ git submodule update --recursive

But it seems to be an invalid syntax, as it replied with:

Usage: git submodule [--quiet] [--cached] [add [-b branch] <repo>
<path>]|[status|init|update [-i|--ini-N|--no-fetch]|summary
[-n|--summary-limit <n>] [<commit>]] [--] [<path>...]|[foreach
<command>]|[sync  [<path>...]]

I also tried this:
[doriad at daviddoria ParaView]$ git submodule update VTK

but it didn't seem to do anything?

Any other ideas?

Thanks,

David

--recursive was added in git 1.6.5:

ref: http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/RelNotes-1.6.5.txt

and it apparently not useful in VTK because there is no submodule inside VTK.

I cannot replicate that behavior.  I've tried loading the ParaView data files bluntfin, disk_out_ref, and RectGrid2.  I've tried them on the current git pull, 3.8.0-RC1, and 3.8.0-RC2.  It works as expected every time.

Hi all,

I am seeing a bug recently that is puzzling me :
It seems that the surface of the datasets is extracted between two filters.

For instance, I setup the following pipeline :
reader -> shrink

The first time this is executed, I see the shrink of the border cells.
If I do the following manipulation
*mofidy any parameter in the reader,
*unmodify this parameter
*and click on apply
(the result being that no change is actually sent to the server, which I can check because the RequestData method is not called again in the reader),

then the shrink filter is refreshed and gives me the good output (the internal cells shrinked).
Has anybody else seen this?

I could not reproduce this. What type of file are you opening. I tried it 
with can.ex2, without any issues. Can you reproduce it with can.ex2?

Hi all, 

I am seeing a bug recently that is puzzling me : 
It seems that the surface of the datasets is extracted between two 
filters. 

For instance, I setup the following pipeline : 
reader -> shrink 

The first time this is executed, I see the shrink of the border cells. 
If I do the following manipulation 
*mofidy any parameter in the reader, 
*unmodify this parameter 
*and click on apply 
(the result being that no change is actually sent to the server, which I 
can check because the RequestData method is not called again in the 
reader), 

then the shrink filter is refreshed and gives me the good output (the 
internal cells shrinked). 
Has anybody else seen this? 

Stephane

Subject: [Paraview] Sum of cell value
Message-ID: <4BF2D42E.8080600@yahoo.de>

I need to sum of a cell value over all cells. I guess this is possible
using a Python Calculator but I don't know how? Other ways?
Is there some documentation for this feature out there?

In general I am little confused about scripting ways: What is the
difference between Python scripting/macro, Python programmable filter
and Python calculator? I guess scripting can do all of the other two
tools, too?

Subject: [Paraview] VTK_USE_PARALLEL missing?
Message-ID: <AANLkTimPqxmNAvXC14wS7loTbd3j7N9OqSamVVlYes1i@mail.gmail.com>

I am not (intentionally) using anything from vtkParallel. However,
when I load my plugin, I get an error that says:

libvtkParallel.so.5.7: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

I have fixed this in the past by turning on VTK_USE_PARALLEL in the
Paraview ccmake and recompiling. However, now VTK_USE_PARLLEL is not
in the advanced options.

1) Any clues how this vtkParallel dependency could be introduced
unintentionally in a VTK filter (it links to vtkHybrid and
vtkInfovis)?
2) Why is the VTK_USE_PARLLEL option missing?

Thanks,

David

Using Process ID Scalars results in an Data Array ProcessId which in
case of np 3 ranges from 0 to 2 (and from 0 to 3 in case of np 4). I
have selected colorBy ProcessID to see if the input is well balanced or
not, unfortunately all the points have the same color. So I conclude
that the data is not well balanced, right?

If I apply the D3 filter I almost see the same results. The only
difference I have noticed is that there is no new Data Array. 

Delaunay 2D is now about three times faster after I applied D3 filter.
However I do not like the resulting triangulation, seems like some
isosurfaces have been calculted.

Subject: [Paraview]  datasets operation
Message-ID: <AANLkTilLbRgnRHaamsdqbIyS8lQpGHNvLH1GH5MtbEhZ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Given two datasets X0 and X1 of cell/point datasets comming from 2 separated
VTK files, with X1 being, at least, X0 incremented with some new cell/point
data such as: X1 = X0 + Xi

Is there a way to visualize the dataset Xi resulting from the substraction
X1 - X0 with Paraview? I tried several solutions with the Append filters but
without any success. I must precise that I don't want here to visualize the
vector field corresponding to the "displacements" between X0 and X1, but
only the "incremented" dataset.

Hope I am clear enough...

Thanks in advance for any help or advice

Hi,

After some more digging around this problem, it seems that it only shows 
up for quadratic cells.
It might be related to the recent evolution I saw where the wireframe 
representation of quadratic cells are not triangulated anymore (which is 
nice!).
Are there quadratic cells in any test file (in ParaViewData) so that I can 
try to reproduce it with it?

Best,
Stephane

I cannot replicate that behavior.  I?ve tried loading the ParaView data 
files bluntfin, disk_out_ref, and RectGrid2.  I?ve tried them on the 
current git pull, 3.8.0-RC1, and 3.8.0-RC2.  It works as expected every 
time.

Hi all, 

I am seeing a bug recently that is puzzling me : 
It seems that the surface of the datasets is extracted between two 
filters. 

For instance, I setup the following pipeline : 
reader -> shrink 

The first time this is executed, I see the shrink of the border cells. 
If I do the following manipulation 
*mofidy any parameter in the reader, 
*unmodify this parameter 
*and click on apply 
(the result being that no change is actually sent to the server, which I 
can check because the RequestData method is not called again in the 
reader), 

then the shrink filter is refreshed and gives me the good output (the 
internal cells shrinked). 
Has anybody else seen this?

Subject: [Paraview] Image Padding : extent problem again
Message-ID: <AANLkTimlprLxI5xcXKce4Cl0PCkrPvFTz1IIlJlTF4GA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I am back with the strange extent/bounds problem (see other threads...)

I want to process FFT-based image convolution in ParaView. Thus I
enabled different VTK filters in ParaView so that I can implement the
following pipeline :

- Read an image and pad it to include
- built a kernel (eg. Wavelet source), normalize it to 1 and pad it in
order to match the image extent
- FFT image and kernel
- Multiply the two FFT
- R-FFT
- Crop

It *should* work ! An "Insight journal" paper has been proposed on
this topic. The first thing I had to do was to enable the VTK
ImagePadFilter's children (mirror, constant and wrap). You will find
the ServerManager XML attached. Problem is that..it doesn't work.

Please try this:
- First, load the XML through the "Manage Plugins" in the "Tools"
menu. It will add a "Image Padding (Constant)" to the filters menu.
- Create a wavelet source with default values
- Plug the "Image Padding (constant)" filter to the wavelet source and
set the OutputWholeExtent to [-20 20 -20 20 -20 20]

Press apply and set the wavelet source to "visible": the bounding
boxes seem to look good, isn't it? Thus, we expect the Pad filter
output extent to be [-20 20 ...].
Now, go to the information tab of the pad filter: extent is [-10
10...], the same as input!
Now, set the representation to slice: "Cannot volume render since no
point (or cell) data available."
Now, set the representation to volume: it works, but with input extent.

If you set the OutputWholeExtent to [-5 5 ... ], this bug doesn't
occur. It is an enlarging-exclusive extent weird behaviour. It means
that today, I am not able to:
   - resample images with finer resolution
   - build volume with input-independent extent
   - pad images
in ParaView.

Please, please, let me know if you can reproduce the problem. If so, I
will (re)submit a bug on Mantis.
Let me know also if this is a builtin limitation of ParaView (because
of Parallel Visualisation or something) and I will stop annoying you
with that.

Thanks a lot
Jerome

Hi,
I am new to this group and am working on paraview extensively from the
last 1 month on  windows.
I am working on images of the size 9MB .
But generally when I have more than 3-4 images (with their counter or
glyph mapping), paraview crashes suddenly. This is more frequent when i
select and deselect different objects in pipeline browser.

Computer details:
Windows XP
Intel Xeon CPU
5150 @ 2.66GHz
1.97 GHz 3.25GB of RAM

The error reads as
Paraview Application error
"The instruction at "0x7c910ede" referenced memory at "0x39e93211". The
memory could not be "read"."

I always save the state of the files , and load it when required. Is this
creating some problems with the memory allocation or no?


I have to collaborate six 3Mb and six 9MB images for my final animation
output, is this feasible.

Please help me out , as I am stuck at this point as my paraview always
crashes .

Thank You in advance

Is this a prebuilt version of ParaView or something that you built?
Can you do a debug build and attach a debugger to it when it crashes
and get the stack trace? That will help us understand why it's
crashing.

Hmm.  Now that I think about it, all my datasets with quadratic elements are surface elements, so this problem wouldn't show up.  The other test data sets have 3D quadratic cells, but without any neighbors.  Is there a simple small example you can post?

Re: [Paraview] extracting the surface between filters




I cannot replicate that behavior.  I've tried loading the ParaView data files bluntfin, disk_out_ref, and RectGrid2.  I've tried them on the current git pull, 3.8.0-RC1, and 3.8.0-RC2.  It works as expected every time.

Hi all,

I am seeing a bug recently that is puzzling me :
It seems that the surface of the datasets is extracted between two filters.

For instance, I setup the following pipeline :
reader -> shrink

The first time this is executed, I see the shrink of the border cells.
If I do the following manipulation
*mofidy any parameter in the reader,
*unmodify this parameter
*and click on apply
(the result being that no change is actually sent to the server, which I can check because the RequestData method is not called again in the reader),

then the shrink filter is refreshed and gives me the good output (the internal cells shrinked).
Has anybody else seen this?

Hi,
I installed the new version without any problems (in the prevous mail I
had problems due to previous process instances of paraview still opened)

The error still exists, Again the debugger has problems , so I could only
get the disassembly file for the problem if of any help,which is attached.

Thank You

Rhushabh

Rhushabh,

You cannot debug the binaries downloaded from paraview.org since they
don't have debugging symbols in them. You'll have to compile ParaView
from source. Refer to the following wiki page on how to build
ParaView.

So, with D3 things run faster now. Solved as well the mentioned
problem, it was due to not scaling the z values. However, maybe a
logical behaviour, the result of the triangulation now consists of
four tiles. Anybody knows how to for example connect them? I have
attached a screenshot showing the separation (vertical lines) of the
tiles.

Jenya,

You might want to look at  Qt/Core/Testing/BasicApp.cxx as a simplest
example of using the pq layer. For more complete customization
examples look under Examples/CustomApplications.

This wiki page may come in handy:
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Writing_Custom_Applications

If you look at the plugins wiki
(http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Plugin_HowTo) it talks about writing
plugins for adding new views/representations. That's what you can
leverage to add new mappers/interactors.

Plot over line probes the original dataset for values at locations
along the line alone. So the max and min that you get after Plot over
line are the max and min values along the line alone, not the whole
input dataset.

It looks like the streamlines filter only accepts point data and the data on the mesh is cell data.  You can get around that by running the Point Data to Cell Data filter, although this seems like an odd restriction on the streamlines filter and you might want to add a feature request to the ParaView bug tracker if this is an issue.

Are you sure that the data isn't simply flat?  It looks like the mesh extends on the order of 100,000 units in the x and y direction, and only about 150 units in the height direction.  What happens if you apply the transform filter and scale the z by, say, 1000?

Hi Ken,

I am now able to load FVCOM model (oceanographic) netCDF data into paraview by enabling Visit plug-ins (there exists a Visit plug-in for reading in FVCOM model data).

However, it plots variables that are functions of 3 spatial variables (in x, y and h) over 2D space (over x and y).  (Yet the horizontal coordinates x and y and the height h are all listed as 'variables' variables as opposed to 'dimensions' variables.)  How using the appropriate filters can I derive 3D images; e.g. scalar fields over x, y and h?  Ultimately I wish to draw streamlines in 3D.

I've attached a small FVCOM file (2 time steps with 3D data).  In order to properly load this particular file, I had to run the following line of script:
upper1_0001_nc = VisItNETCDFDatabaseBridge(  FileName='/array/home/jculina/Desktop/ParaView-3.8.0-RC1-Linux-x86_64/my_data/upper1_0001.nc' )
For some reason, it automatically reads SOME FVCOM files using the visit plug-in, but other FVCOM files (with similar names and .nc extension and visit plugins enabled), it reads in the files as netcdf files.

thanks alot!
Joel

Subject: Re: [Paraview] trouble reading in netCDF file

The netCDF reader in version understands the COARDS convention (a common subset of CF).  It sounds like the variable annotation you describe should be supported.  However, one major limitation of the netCDF reader is that it only supports reading variables of the same dimensions because it puts them all on the same grid.  So if you have selected to load variables with different dimensions, it will use the dimensions of the first variable and fail to load the rest.  That would explain the behavior you are getting since most netCDF files I have run into seem to have variables with low dimension listed first. (There is no particular reason for this.  It just seems to be what people/applications do.) If this is the case, you are probably also getting a lot of warnings from the netCDF reader about it and the Information panel will be missing many of your variables.  Try turning off all variables in the Object Inspector and turning on only one variable you are interested in.

If this is the problem, it should go away in version 3.8.  Realizing this the 3.6 interface to the netCDF reader really sucks, I changed it to select dimensions instead of variables.  All variables conforming to the selected dimensions are loaded.  It makes using the netCDF reader much easier and problems like the one I described go away.  I also expanded the reader to understand most of the CF convention.

Unfortunately, don't use the CVS for this just yet.  I have recently discovered that a new netCDF reader that was apparently built for a specific use case but seems to screw up on most data was added to ParaView and it is overriding the existing netCDF reader.  We are trying to work on a resolution.

Hi,

Thank you Ken for responding.

I suspect that your diagnosis is correct; the root of the problem, I believe, is that I am reading in netCDF data that follows the CF convention.   In particular, the grid is an unstructured triangular 2D grid ('poly data' grid in the venacular of paraview).  The 'dimensions' variables include integer identifiers for triangle nodes, but NOT lat, long, x, y, time etc.  Rather, these are included among the 'variables' variables (e.g. lat = lat(node)).

Is the problem indeed that the paraview netCDF reader cannot understand this particular netCDF-CF file?  Is there a way around this, without having to change the way the data is outputted (from netCDF-CF to netCDF-COARDS convention)?  Note that I can read into paraview certain variables by filtering out the 1-dimensional variables (lat, long etc.), but of course these variables do not have the correct dependencies (they should be dependent on the variables I filtered out - lat, long etc.)

thanks,
Joel

It sounds like you are reading in an array with 0 or 1 dimensions (not including time).  Although the reader should happily create an image data of that structure, the standard rendering views only understand image data of 2 or 3 dimensions.  Hence you get the error.

If you want to see the data in a plot, try adding the "Plot Data" filter.

Hi,

I am trying to read in a netCDF file using Paraview 3.6.2.  It can 'see' the netCDF file, but when I attempt to read in the file by pressing 'Apply', I get the following error message:

ERROR: In /home/kitware/ParaView3/Utilities/BuildScripts/ParaView-3.6/ParaView3/Servers/Filters/vtkTexturePainter.cxx, line 280
vtkTexturePainter (0xb8a0000): Incorrect dimensionality.

I'm not sure which netCDF release created the netCDF file.  However, I read in a previous post that paraview 3.6.1 could handle netCDF 4, and since  "all netCDF files ever written can always be read by the latest netCDF release. That is, we guarantee backward data compatibility" then 3.6.2 should be able to handle my netCDF file (which wasn't created too recently).

I can read the netCDF file into MATLAB, so it isn't corrupt.

So what's the problem?

thanks
Joel

I have seen a crash when using Cygwin, and X forwarding to a Linux box.  Are you doing this?

Otherwise, to the best of my knowledge, this seems to be an unknown, unrepeatable bug.

Hi Luc,

I am not aware of a filter in paraview that does this.  You could write a
python programmable filter that takes two datasets and labels the common
points.  Then use the clip filter to clip away the labeled points (set Clip
Type to scalar.)

...and since the paraview wiki didn't have any programmable filter examples
using multiple inputs, I decided to add this as an example.  Here's the
link:

Hmm. I'm actually running it on a Linux cluster (SGI ICE) and X 
forwarding to another Linux box. So the forwarding bit is similar but I 
wonder if that could cause a crash like this?!

Any hints on how I might be able to track down the problem?

Cheers,
Cihan

try, using the "resample with dataset" to transfer the X1 field to the  
geometry of the second file topology, then use "append attributes" to  
add the extracted X1 field to the second file, finally use the  
"Calculator filter" to calculate the difference.

Hi!

I've now tried to compile ParaView 3.8.0 with Manta. I followed the instructions of http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/images/a/a4/Manta_adaptive_paraview.pdf, but I running make for ParaView, I get the error

[ 85%] /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/4.3.4/../../../../x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/bin/ld: ../../../bin/libvtkManta.a(vtkMantaActor.o): relocation R_X86_64_32S against `vtkMantaActorThreadCache::FreeMantaResources()' can not be used when making a shared object; recompile with -fPIC
../../../bin/libvtkManta.a: could not read symbols: Bad value

How can I recompile with -fPIC in CMake? Should I recompile Manta or ParaView with that option?

Thx,
Natalie

When one saves plot over line data in a .csv file, the first line contains
"Points:0" "Points:1" "Points:2"

Would it be more descriptive to give the real names which are "X" "Y" "Z" ?

Or at least coordsX, coordsY, coordsZ to be consistent with the

That'd explain it. There's is a fix for this issue on  the "release"
branch that was committed after 3.8-RC2. It will be included in the
3.8 final release. You can checkout out the release branch from
ParaView git repo, to test it out.

If I remember correctly, after you partition your points, you try to create
a grid with the Delaunay2D filter.  It looks like the Delaunay2D filter
isn't a "true" parallel filter meaning that each process does the
triangulation on all of the points that are assigned to it but doesn't take
into account creating cells between close points that are on different
processes.  The best suggestion I have is to try the following:
1) use D3 to partition your points
2) triangulate on each process using Delaunay2D
3) extract the edges on each process using Extract Edges
4) try the Delaunay2D to stitch these edges together (this may not work as
desired)
5) append the datasets/polydatas together using the Append Datasets filter

I have no idea whether or not this will work for you.  The main problem is
that VTK/ParaView wasn't designed to be used as a parallel grid generation
tool.

Subject: [Paraview] 3.8.0 segfault - Animate Parameters -> File Prefix
Message-ID: <20100520155311.GB15095@mech-cluster241.men.bris.ac.uk>

I run pv 3.8.0-RC2, QT version 4.6.2, built from source on
Linux 2.6.18-164.6.1.el5 #1 SMP x86_64 GNU/Linux

I've a sequence of numbered binary files named <filename>.number,
which I want to load into PV and create a keyframe animation of.

I followed this guide:
http://www.arsc.edu/support/news/HPCnews/HPCnews403.shtml#article3

I chose in the Object Inspector Properties -> File Prefix:

	/path/to/file/<filename>

in File Pattern:

	%s.%d

then Apply - all seems fine.

The pipeline browser displays the name of the first file
in the sequence: <filename>.0

I then open Animation View.

In Animate more Parameters I choose File Prefix. HIt "+" and
created a new animation track. Now I needed to change the Prefix
to the value of the last file in the sequence. I double click
on the track to bring up the Animation Keyframes menu. Then
double click on the Value field, enter the desired value
(10 in my case), and hit ok. The new value appears in the
anumation track.

When I click play animation - I get segfault.
No other output.

Please advise

I do apologise if this is explained in the manual somewhere.

many thanks
anton

Andy,

thanks for your suggestion, however it does not work, I guess what
you have mentioned about that Paraview was not designed as a
parallel grid generation tool is the crucial point here. I will try to
find a solution for my problem without falling back to serial
processing.

Hi Eric,

I just committed a change to trace so that it inserts this line at the top
of all generated scripts:

  paraview.simple._DisableFirstRenderCameraReset()

It's not the ideal solution, but it resolves the problem for now.  Maybe
we'll come up with something better in the future.

I'm trying to connect to a server with pvpython and want to use the
--connect-id option.  Is it possible to set this inside my python
script? 

Thanks,

You can specify connect-id as a command line argument to pvpython or pvbatch:

 ./bin/pvpython --connect-id=12 /tmp/foo.py

I see that, but is it possible to set it _inside_ the script?  Right now, my script doesn't know what the connection id will be until after the script has started running.

Here's a sample script:

from paraview.simple import *
pm = servermanager.vtkProcessModule.GetProcessModule()
pm.GetOptions().SetConnectID(13)

It would only be the people who were writing a script from scratch and adding camera controls that might not know about those commands or flags and be surprised. But, with all of the Trace functionality built in now, how big a percentage will be doing that?

Or I could add the flag to the view constructor-  view = CreateRenderView(ResetCameraOnFirstRender=False).  My first preference would be to just get rid of the reset camera behavior.  I'd have to update some of the python tutorials to add calls to ResetCamera().

Are you referring to bug 10621? I patched RC2 with the fix for this bug 
following your suggestion but I still get the same behaviour. Note that 
everything else I do with ParaView seems to work fine except for the 
crash when trying to open the Color Map editor.

I ran with valgrind and found this:

Subject: [Paraview] Pressure around cylinder
Message-ID: <AANLkTinFu0nnkZrDzoUlXpGO_SvbhaxVcaA-96VN3A7t@mail.gmail.com>

Is there a filter in paraview to plot the pressure around a curved line? I
need to plot the pressure around a circumference at a section of cylinder.

The ^A is the "vtkValidPointMask" entry.

Hi Stephen,

The issue has been fixed on the development head. I have included a link to
the fix if you are interested.

Subject: [Paraview] How to set the default executive to
	vtkCompositeDataPipeline?
Message-ID: <AANLkTikeoV3YB1LMLrnZfAHsm9OcVmZicX81y-Ggm8Ck@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I would like to create a vtkCompositeDataSet-based source with Paraview API
and set the default executive of vtkAlgorithm to the
vtkCompositeDataPipeline.


I couldn't find an SM proxy defined for the vtkCompositeDataSet class in the
ServerManager resource XMLs and I don't see any proxies defined for
executives either.

Is there a way to to do that with the Paraview out of the box or do I need
to create my own custom proxies?

Any advise is much appreciated,
Jenya

ParaView's default Executive type is vttkCompositeDataPipeline, see
vtkSMSourceProxy for where that is done.

Only two sourceproxies don't use that default, grep for the executive
tag in the XML configuration to see which ones.

If you are looking for examples of how to make a reader/source that
produces composite data I recommend vtkDataObjectGenerator. That can
produce multiblock and amr data if you give it the right program
string.

David,

Thank you for the reply.

A follow up question: how would I go about changing an executive to try out
the new streaming multi-threaded executive? There don't seem to be
"executive" properties declared for the SM proxy objects.

That is uncharted territory. I've been meaning to try it, but haven't
gotten to that yet. Perhaps Huy Vo or Claudio Silva (cc'd) from the
University Of Utah will let us know if they have tried their new
executive under ParaView.

To start down that path, begin by changing vtkSMSourceProxy's
constructor to make that the default executive instead of the
composite executive. It should be upwards compatible with composite
data pipeline. If that much works, you will then have to enable
multithreading view the new executive to try to get some speedup out
of the thread level parallelism.

Enabling the push pipeline features of the executive will probably be
much more work because ParaView wasn't designed with that in mind.

Let us know how it goes!

Message-ID: <A38DF1C3-7D36-45DD-B72F-CDA2090D64CB@whoi.edu>



I and my colleagues have trouble visualizing our pvts/vtk files on Linux housed on Mac OS 10.6.2.
We can determine this is a sort of compatibility issue in ParaView on Mac OS because same input files
perfectly work with ParaView on PC. Typical phenomena in our visualization is the crash of ParaView
either at certain timesteps (time step 0, time step 8 crashes ParaView etc.) or certain fields (e.g. stress field, strain field, etc.).
Has anybody reported similar problem? What would be the solution?
We recognize that ParaView is extremely useful for us to visualize results from heavy finite-element modeling on geodynamics.
I would greatly appreciate if you can provide any advice on this.

Any possibility of providing small sample dataset to reproduce the crash?

Hello Utkarsh,

I could not find this filter in my paraview installation v3.6.1. Is it
avialble in different version? or is it a plugin to be installed. BY now you
would have realized that I am quite new to Paraview. Thanks for addressing
to my query.

if you go to filters->alphabetical -> Plot On Intersection,  Curves you will
see it I am using 3.8 though but it should be in 3.6 as well though!

The filter is available in 3.8-release candidates and will be in the
3.8 release. It's not present in 3.6.

Message-ID: <AANLkTilSnFBggT5gdsHlpZQQbTN0ye-3g5JroRp-gsvm@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, hopefully you can help me with my issue.

I'd like to do some calculations involving some vector data, but it keeps
throwing an error.

(iHat*abs(2DVEL_X))+(jHat*abs(
2DVEL_Y))+(kHat*0)

I think what's happening is that ParaView expects an operator between the 2
and the D. However, the 2 is part of the variable name. Is there a way to
tell ParaView this, such as an escape character or a way to enclose the
variable name?

I'd like to not have to rename the variables in the file, because I'm not in
charge of the data. If there is a way I can do that in ParaView, that would
work as well, I think.

I've just started using ParaView, so hopefully I'm not missing something
obvious, but thanks in advance for your help.

Hi Micheal,

You can use the calculator filter to rename variables. Could you also create
a bug report at http://www.paraview.org/Bug/main_page.php.

You won't be able to use the calculator to rename it but you can use a
Programmable Filter:

input = self.GetPolyDataInput()

output = self.GetPolyDataOutput()

 output.ShallowCopy(input)

 output.GetPointData().GetArray("2DVEL_X").SetName("SomethingElse")


Regards,
Paul

Hello, 

I have saved the segmentation-outputs of two algorithms (itk-watershed and region growing) as. mhd file. Then I wanted to load the .mhd files with Paraview, but I get the following errors.

"ERROR: In .. \ .. \ .. \ src \ server \ Filters \ vtkTexturePainter.cxx, line 287 vtkTexturePainter (00000000082D23E0): Incorrect dimensionality." and

Can someone please tell me what these errors mean.

Hi,
I don't have any errors with the "RegionGrowing" dataset: I loaded it
successfully.

The Watershed is 300MB, I don't have time to download it...

Good luck!

Subject: [Paraview] Minimal X Window System config
Message-ID: <3E1A4BF19EB946AC83D20BB3EE896278@notebook>

An update... I have a solution :)

I think that twm hangs because it expects user interaction (i.e. a mouse
click) before creating the window. Debugging pvserver shows that it is
sitting waiting for XGetWindowAttributes and never gets them.

So I tried another tack and just ran pvserver without twm (or any window
manager) and used xinit to invoke the X Server. The following commands work
and will probably be useful for someone else...

1) Run a single instance (X Server shuts down when complete)
xinit <fullpath>/pvserver 

2) Run multiple instances (X Server shuts down when complete)
xinit <fullpath>/mpirun -np 16 ./pvserver

3) Run multiple instances across multiple GPUs (X Server shuts down when
complete)
xinit <fullpath>/mpirun -bynode -np 8 ./pvserver -display :0.0 : -np 8
./pvserver -display :0.1

Cheers,

Paul

Subject: Minimal X Window System config

Hi All,

Does any one have information they can share on a minimal X Window System
config (Centos 5.5 cluster nodes) for pvserver remote rendering to work?

I can install a very minimal system consisting of things like fonts,
xorg-x11-twm, glx-utils, xorg-x11-server-Xorg, xorg-x11-twm, xorg-x11-xinit,
xorg-x11-server-Xorg and xorg-x11-xauth.

If I run Specviewperf, glxgears or glxinfo the output is as expected.
However pvserver just hangs when I connect to it from a client. The weird
thing is that if I run pvserver or ParaView via VirtualGL in a TurboVNC
session it works!?

My solution at the moment works but is big bang and overkill for a cluster
node:

yum groupinstall "X Window System" "GNOME Desktop Environment"

Note I have read the following:

Setting up a ParaView Server
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Setting_up_a_ParaView_Server

Step by step guide for the installation and configuration of a cluster to
run ParaView

Hi!

Is it possible that when installing paraview from the ParaView-3.8.0-RC2-Win32-x86.exe installer, the Manta Plugin is not supported?

Greets,

Yes, that's correct. Manta is not packaged with ParaView hence the
plugin is not enabled in the binaries.

Subject: [Paraview] Adding an interactive slice widget
Message-ID: <AANLkTinnOLp59YMdwaVD-fcAQ9gRZRw_dTOAFVWgXdUL@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am trying to figure out how to add a slice widget that has the
interactivity behavior just liek in the Paraview application.
When I add the following code, I get the visual representation of the
widget. However, performing mouse events on the bounding box or normal of
the widget doesn't make the widget change its position, orientation. Instead
the whole view's camera position is changing.

    vtkSMProxy* sliceWidget =
m_paraviewObjectBuilder->createProxy("representations",

"ImplicitPlaneWidgetRepresentation",

m_paraviewActiveObjects->activeServer(),
                                                                   "slice
widget");
    doubleProp = vtkSMDoubleVectorProperty::SafeDownCast(

sliceWidget->GetProperty("PlaceWidget"));
    double sourceBounds[6];
    sourceRepresentation.getDataBounds(sourceBounds);
    doubleProp->SetElements(sourceBounds);
    pqSMAdaptor::setElementProperty(sliceWidget->GetProperty("Visibility"),
true);
    sliceWidget->UpdateVTKObjects();
    // Add the widget to the view.
    pqSMAdaptor::addProxyProperty(
        m_renderView->getProxy()->GetProperty("Representations"),
sliceWidget);

Any advise is much appreciated,
Jenya

Try adding the following code after your code:
      pqSMAdaptor::setElementProperty(sliceWidget->GetProperty("Enabled"), 1);
     sliceWidget->UpdateVTKObjects();

Utkarsh,

Thank you for the response. I think that moved me one step closer to the
solution.

However, now I get the following runtime error in the Output window:
ERROR: In ..\..\..\VTK\Widgets\vtkAbstractWidget.cxx, line 119

vtkImplicitPlaneWidget2 (000000000D01C8C0): The interactor must be set prior
to enabling the widget



I don't see an "Interactor" property defined in the XML file for the
ImplicitPlaneWidgetRepresentation and I get a zero pointer if I try to get
it with:
  vtkSMProperty* p = sliceWidget->GetProperty("Interactor");

Make sure you are changing the enabled state after the widget has been
added to the view i.e. after the following code:

 pqSMAdaptor::addProxyProperty(
        m_renderView->getProxy()->GetProperty("Representations"), sliceWidget)
m_renderView->getProxy()->UpdateVTKObjects();

Utkarsh,

Thanks again, that worked.

Now that the widget shows and can be interacted with I need to register an
oberver with it. I am not sure how to do that, since, again, I don't see any
command properties defined for it in the XML resource file.

And another question - where or how would I find the information that, for
example a widget has to be added to a view before it can be enabled,  so
that I wouldn't be bugging others with my posts to the mailing list? Is
there a documentation or a set of examples?

Jenya,

Look at vtkSMNewWidgetRepresentationProxy::ExecuteEvent. It fires
events when one interacts with the widget. You can add observers for
those events.

As far as documentation for such things goes, the source code if your
best guide -- attaching debugger and back tracking to determine why
that error is being thrown serves as a good starting point.

Hi,

I am having a devil of a time trying to get my python shell plugins
to work right, I can't seem to find any extensive documentation, just
loads of examples...  Anyway, hopefully you will be able to help me!

I would like to popup a dialog box when there is an error in the
plugin.  How can I do that?  If the user doesn't have the python shell
open, they can't even see the output of a print statement.

Secondly how can one gracefully end a python shell plugin?   A
sys.exit() just kills paraview since the plugin is running in the
same process I guess.  Throwing an exception is OK if the user has the
python shell open, otherwise it is just a silent failure.

Thank you for any help

Matt Wilkins

Hi,

I am writing a plugin in the python shell.  I can get source info with
ActiveSource, or FindSource, but I need to be able to get some info
from the user.  Is there a way to popup a dialog box?  I know I could
just import Qt myself and do it, but I am guessing paraview already has
an active Qt mainloop somewhere, and starting another wouldn't be
smart.

Any help would be much appreciated please 

Thank you

Hi!

I've got another problem - kind of "from one day to the other". I remember having tested paraview in parallel yesterday, but today I try

mpirun -np 4 ./pvserver

and it says 

Listen on port: 11111
Process id: 0 >> ERROR: In /home/happenhofer/svn/paraview/branches/ParaView-3.8.0-RC2/Servers/Common/vtkProcessModuleConnectionManager.cxx, line 192
vtkProcessModuleConnectionManager (0x18dc570): Failed to set up server socket.

Any ideas what could cause the problem here?

Thanks a lot,
Natalie

Hi Natalie,

The error is meant to tell you that there is already some process using
port 11111. Given that you seem to be running ParaView on Linux you can
confirm this by
$ netstat -na | grep 11111
or alternatively
$ lsof -i:11111

The latter will tell you the name of the process that is blocking the
port (the first won't). If that name is cropped and not unique try
adding "+c15" to the lsof command line. Either kill the process that
blocks the port or use another one yourself with
$ pvserver --server-port=11112

Message-ID: <1834A9E2-90B4-4B1A-B30C-64B3CE215608@ucalgary.ca>

Is there some file, distributed with ParaView binaries, that specifies the particular versions of libraries that the ParaView binary was built with?  This would make it easier to build plug-ins that can be used with the binary versions available from the ParaView download page.

The required information is (or should be) available on this web page:

http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView_Binaries

However, this page seems not to be always kept up to date (e.g. ParaView-3.8.0-RC2-Darwin-x86_64.dmg is not listed).

Ideally, such a list of build library versions would be automatically generated by CMake and distributed with the binary distribution.

You can use python's raw_input() function to get user input.  Paraview's
raw_input support is meant to mimic command line programs, so it expects
that the python shell is open and places the text input box at the cursor.

If you want to use PyQt4, see

Thank you, this is what I needed, good stuff.  The only thing I
couldn't immediately figure out from that post, was what to do with
widgets that need a parent, because I couldn't get hold of the main
paraview window widget.  Anyway this is what I did:

---
import PyQt4.QtGui

# this is a dummy widget to use as the parent for other widgets that need a
parent
wid = PyQt4.QtGui.QWidget()

# get some user input
ret = PyQt4.QtGui.QInputDialog.getText(wid, 'hi', 'first question')

# do some other stuff

# oh dear a warning
ret = PyQt4.QtGui.QMessageBox.warning(wid, 'hi', 'there was a recoverable problem', PyQt4.QtGui.QMessageBox.Ok, PyQt4.QtGui.QMessageBox.NoButton, PyQt4.QtGui.QMessageBox.NoButton) 

# maybe get some more input
ret = PyQt4.QtGui.QInputDialog.getText(wid, 'hi', 'second question')
---


Thanks

Matt

Hi,

Following up on my own post here...

This I can do now using the advice from Pat (in previous posting which
I can't link to right now since it isn't archived, but the subject was
"Getting user input while in python shell plugin").  I just import
PyQt4.QtGui and go from there.

So the failure won't be silent now, since I can popup a warning or
error box, then I can just raise an exception to stop execution.  For
completeness here we go:

import PyQt4.QtGui

# this is a dummy widget to use as the parent for other widgets that need a parent
wid = PyQt4.QtGui.QWidget()

# get some user input
ret = PyQt4.QtGui.QInputDialog.getText(wid, 'hi', 'first question')

# do some other stuff

# oh dear a warning
ret = PyQt4.QtGui.QMessageBox.warning(wid, 'hi', 'there was a recoverable problem', PyQt4.QtGui.QMessageBox.Abort, PyQt4.QtGui.QMessageBox.Retry, PyQt4.QtGui.QMessageBox.NoButton)

if ret == PyQt4.QtGui.QMessageBox.Abort:
   raise ValueError, "pooed out"
else:
   ret = PyQt4.QtGui.QInputDialog.getText(wid, 'hi', 'second question')

You could use QApplication.activeWindow(), you might get the mainwindow or
python dialog.  Or you could cycle thru the list of
QApplication.topLevelWidgets() to look for the paraview mainwindow.

Alternatively use: pqCoreUtilities::mainWidget() -- it tries to find
an active mainwindow by default.

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView 3.8.0 Available for download
Message-ID: <AANLkTiml39i-Z6sXO4NyZOI5eOW_Fhfoq_Ofi-59TQsJ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello All,

Kitware, Sandia National Laboratories and Los Alamos National Laboratory are
proud to announce the release of ParaView 3.8.0. The binaries and sources
are available for download from the ParaView website (
http://www.paraview.org/paraview/resources/software.html). This release
includes several performance improvements, bug fixes for users, and plenty
of new features for plugin and application developers. We have made it
easier to locate cells/points in your dataset using queries. Search the
ParaView Wiki for "Find Data using Queries" for more information.

The plugin loading and management dialog was redesigned to make it easier to
load plugins. It's now possible to configure plugins to be auto-loaded every
time ParaView starts. We've added support for plotting over curves and
intersection lines using the filters "Plot On Sorted Lines" and "Plot On
Intersection Curves".

A couple of GPU-based rendering/visualization techniques have been
incorporated along with GPU-based volume rendering support for 3D image
volumes, which is accessible through the "Volume Mapper" option on the
Display tab. Support for Line Integral Convolution (LIC) is available as a
plugin; this support can be used for visualizing vector fields over
arbitrary surfaces.

ParaView now includes (in source form only) an interface to the University
of Utah's Manta interactive software ray tracing engine. The Manta plugin
provides a new 3D View type which uses Manta instead of OpenGL for
rendering. The plugin is primarily being developed for visualization of
large datasets on parallel machines. In single processor configuration it
has the benefit of allowing realistic rendering effects such as shadows,
translucency and reflection.

In terms of performance improvements, we've greatly improved the first
render time for datasets with large numbers of blocks. Raw image reading for
parallel file systems underwent a major overhaul making it fast and
efficient. Options were added to the Settings dialog to fine tune image
compression, improving interactivity when remote rendering over connections
with varying bandwidths.

After the introducing Python tracing in the previous release, we have
expanded the purview of tracing to include selections, lookup tables, and
implicit functions.

For climate simulation folks, this release includes support for NetCDF with
CF (Climate and Forecast) conventions. For cosmology researchers, the Cosmo
plugin has been substantially revised. The major improvement is that the
plugin now works in a data parallel fashion, so that it can be used with
higher resolution simulation results. We have reintroduced basic support for
CAVE rendering which was lost since the major overhaul for ParaView 3.0.

Several new readers have been contributed: WindBlade a reader for wind
turbine and fire simulation data, VPIC a reader for particle and cell
physics simulation data, and netcdf POP a reader for POP ocean simulation
data in a netcdf container format.

AdaptiveParaView, a new experimental application developed using the
ParaView application framework is also now available in source format. Like
StreamingParaView, AdaptiveParaView processes structured datasets in a
piecewise fashion, omitting pieces which are unimportant, in order to make
it possible to visualize datasets which do not otherwise fit in RAM.
AdaptiveParaView differs from prior work in that it renders pieces in a
multi-resolution manner, initially producing low-resolution images and then
progressively filling in greater detail within the viewing frustum. This
application still contains many experimental features and is not yet
documented, but we encourage users to try it out and report bugs and feature
requests.

PVBlot is a command tool for batch or interactive processing of Exodus data
files. It is provided as a plugin. The commands create various mesh
visualzations and XY plots of variable versus time, or variable versus
variable. The plugin adds an interactive pvblot console to the ParaView
Tools menu. Documentation for PVBlot is built into the tool, just type
'help' or 'help '. The SierraTools plugin provides pvblot-like features but
exposes the functionality through toolbar buttons and dialogs in place of
text commands.

There are several other fixes including those for charting and plotting,
wireframes for quadratic surfaces, and for dealing with temporal ranges.

For developers, this release includes major changes to the core ParaView
libraries making it easier to create and deploy custom applications based on
the ParaView framework. This enables developers to create applications with
fundamentally different workflows than that of ParaView while still
leveraging ParaView's parallel processing and large data visualization
capabilities. Search for "Writing Custom Applications" on the ParaView Wiki
for details.

The plugin framework has undergone an overhaul as well, making it easier to
debug issues with loading of plugins as well as support for importing
plugins in static applications.

Starting with ParaView 3.8, we will be releasing development binaries for
ParaView, which will make it easier for developers to build and distribute
plugins that are compatible with the binaries downloaded from our website.
These development binaries will be available shortly.

As always, we rely on your feedback to make ParaView better. Please use
http://paraview.uservoice.com/ or click on the "Tell us what you think" link
on paraview.org to leave your feedback and vote for new features.

The ParaView Team.

Subject: [Paraview] Couple of bugs in 3.8.0
Message-ID: <ADD23E5AF059430C8FB5718AF9A82664@notebook>

I have come across a couple of bugs/quirks in the official release of 3.8.0

1) When using MPI version I compiled I see the following trying to open raw
files...

ERROR: In ..\..\..\src\Servers\Common\vtkPVDataSetAttributesInformation.cxx,
line 494
vtkPVDataSetAttributesInformation (0000000007551280): Error parsing default
attributes from message.

2) Using the precompiled binarys, with Server ParaView-3.8.0-Linux-x86_64
and Client Win64. Volumnes have the outline on all the time.


The good news is that in 3.8.0 RC2 GPU intermittant rendering wasn't working
well, in 3.8.0 it does.

I can work with 3.8.0 RC2 for now but thought I'd mention the above in case
it impacts someone else.

Cheers,

Paul

Once you clone paraview with

git clone git://paraview.org/ParaView.git

then checkout the release branch with

git branch --track release origin/release

That reminds me, I need to sign the tag for the release. I'll do that now

Eric,

The wiki page you referred is supposed to have all the necessary

Hi Eric,

I just updated that wiki yesterday afternoon as part of the final release.
Please let me know if there is information missing. Though I agree with you
that something that is generated as part of the release would be nice :-).

Message-ID: <9CF2C436-70C3-48D7-B4D2-C54B40D67809@videotron.ca>

Hi,

is it possible to change the default font and size, color and others for the color legend in ~/.config/ParaView/ParaView3.9.0.ini ?
This is something I have been fighting with for some time ... If not possible, where in the source code those values are hard-coded ?
The "Make Default" button in the color scale editor does not work for me.

Best regards,

PO

Paraview doesn't have a way to pass pointers to QObjects from c++ to python,
or vice versa.  You can use PyQt wrapped methods to search for named widgets
though.

Doh! didn't realize you were going to call it from python. Stick with

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView 3.8.0 Not Installing Client Plugins correctly.
Message-ID: <AANLkTikqViuzKLPVxGiv1qyRFMIr2VGmYykWxsveJmCU@mail.gmail.com>

Pulled ParaView 3.8.0 from Git. Configured with CMake for VS2008 x64
with PARAVIEW_EXTRA_EXTERNAL_MODULES listing 4 of my custom plugins.
Compiled. Installed. And all the "client" plugins are installed lose
into the ParaView-3.8.0/bin directory instead of
ParaView-3.8.0/bin/plugins. Also, I have NSIS installed, where is the
"PACKAGE" target in the VS Solution or is there another mechanism to
use to create the installer?
  The other (probably more likely) possibility is that I didn't really
pull the 3.8.0 tag from git and instead have some other tag.

# On branch v3.8.0
# Changed but not updated:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
#   (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
#
#	modified:   CMake/FindHDF5.cmake
#
# Untracked files:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
#
#	.cproject
#	.project
#	Applications/ParaView/Testing/XML/Fractal3D.xml
#	CMake/AdjustLibVars.cmake
#	CMake/_FindHDF5.cmake
#	i386/
#	x64/
no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

 I just tried this with the ParaView 3.8.0 source code .zip file from
the paraview.org web site and had the same results. I also built the
NSIS installer, and then actually ran the installer and the same issue
happens. Bug?

Just built ParaView 3.8.0 (using the .zip file from the paraview.org
web site) on Windows 7 x64 using VS 2008 Win32 project and then
generated the NSIS installer. The name of the installer, and in fact
the name of the installed binaries reads ParaView 3.9.0 which is a bit
confusing to say the least.

Thanks for catching that Mike, apparently my script that makes the tar balls
didn't properly switch to the release. I have replaced the source with the
correct version

Thanks again!

Hi Paul

1. Can you send us a sample dataset to try and recreate this
2. I think that is controlled by a setting in Under Edit->Setting->Render
View-> Adjust the Outline Threshold.

Thanks!

Subject: [Paraview] pvbatch + LoadState('..') +XDMF = empty image
Message-ID: <4BFEC04F.4050409@gmx.de>

Hi,

I try to use pvbatch to render a whole bunch of screenshots using a
script. pvbatch works fine if I simply create a sphere and write that
image to disk.

But loading a predefined pipeline using LoadState('pstate.pvsm') which
includes a datset in XDMF file format fails.

Any idea what I am doing wrong?
This seems to be related to bug 6495
(http://www.itk.org/Bug/view.php?id=6495&nbn=2), but the suggested
solution cannot be used with LoadState(..).

Greetings
Jens

====================
from paraview import servermanager

# connect to pvserver
servermanager.Connect()

# reload state
#r = servermanager.LoadState('paraview_state.pvsm')

# render png
view = servermanager.CreateRenderView()
view.ResetCamera()
view.StillRender()
view.WriteImage( "Test1.png", "vtkPNGWriter" )
====================

Here's an updated script:
=================
from paraview.simple import *

# reload state
servermanager.LoadState('/tmp/state.pvsm')

view = GetRenderViews()[0]

## render png
view.ResetCamera()
view.StillRender()
view.WriteImage( "/tmp/Test1.png", "vtkPNGWriter" )
==================


The problem was that your script was creating a new view, and not
using the view created by the state file.

Dave,
 Thanks for the quick update. The version now seems correct on the
generated installer. Bad news is that plugins are _still_ not
installed correctly which results in a pretty non-functional ParaView.

Mike,

That was a conscious decision. We deliberately install all plugin dlls
in the same directory as the paraview.exe on windows, just to avoid
missing dlls issues at runtime. Originally, we had the separate
"plugins" directory to make it easier for users to locate the plugins
and load them manually. But now, that's a non-issue, since paraview
explicitly lists all the plugins it's distributed with in the plugin
manager dialog.

Are you saying that the plugins added using
PARAVIEW_EXTRA_EXTERNAL_MODULES are not being installed at all? If
that's the case, then it's definitely a bug.

As far as the package generation goes, you need to use CPack. Refer to
this wiki page for details:

Subject: [Paraview] Ignore pyc files?
Message-ID: <C824289F.1635E%kmorel@sandia.gov>

I've noticed that my build runs python on source files, and python automatically creates a compiled python file next to the source file.  Consequently, after a build git reports untracked files:

# On branch master
# Untracked files:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
#
#       CoProcessing/CoProcessor/Testing/Cxx/PythonScriptTest.pyc
#       Servers/ServerManager/Testing/Python/SMPythonTesting.pyc
nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

Does it make sense to add and check in a .gitignore file to ignore all .pyc files?

So then what is the point of having ParaView look in the plugins
directory if it is not going to be used. Why not just have ParaView
look in the "bin" folder (at least on windows)?

I see there is a file called ".plugins" inside the bin directory. Mine
has the following content:

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<Plugins>
  <Plugin name="SierraPlotTools" auto_load="0"/>
  <Plugin name="SurfaceLIC" auto_load="0"/>
  <Plugin name="AnalyzeReader" auto_load="0"/>
  <Plugin name="AnalyzeWriter" auto_load="0"/>
  <Plugin name="NIfTIReader" auto_load="0"/>
  <Plugin name="NIfTIWriter" auto_load="0"/>
</Plugins>

This is missing my plugins although the plugins are "installed" in the
bin directory during the "INSTALL" project build. There is another
file in the build directory called "PluginList.txt" that _does_ list
my plugins though.

How are you building your plugin? I believe that the ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN
macro constructs the list of Plugins that get written into the .plugins
file.

Hi All,
I am trying to setup a pvserver on a workstation with 4 cores and 2 
gpus. The workstation is running windows 7 64bit, MPICH2 1.2.1p1,  and 
ParaView 3.8.0-RC2. Here is my local pvserver command

mpiexec -channel nemesis -n 2 .\pvserver.exe -display :0.0 
--use-offscreen-rendering : -n 2 .\pvserver.exe -display :0.1 
--use-offscreen-rendering

Somehow the command hangs. Is -display option available in windows? If 
so, what is the right way to use it? I was trying to put 2 core + 1 gpu 
together. If there is another way to optimize the use of cpu and gpu, 
please let me know. Thanks a lot.

Best,
x

I am calling ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN in my Cmake files. Not sure why this  
isn't working. I thought we had that fixed. At least at some point  
during the RC process this did actually work.

Here is some more information about what is going on with my windows
build. I had to add the following to the top of my
"*ParaViewImport.cmake" file:

SET (BUILD_PARAVIEW_PLUGINLIST ON)

So now the .plugins file correctly has my plugins listed except that
the "autoload" property is set to "0". Shouldn't that be "1" by
default? Seems odd but I am sure I don't fully understand all the
ramifications of having that value set to "1" by default.

Also, during the build I am compiling a 3rd party library that needs
to get added to the installer generation. Is there a way to do this?
If I run the "INSTALL" project from VS I get everything installed
correctly. If I use the CPack command like took to generate the
installer the library is missing from the install.

You'll want to add an install rule for that third party library.

  INSTALL(FILES ${Third_Party_lib}
    DESTINATION ${PV_INSTALL_BIN_DIR}
    COMPONENT Runtime)

Mike,

Attached is a patch that fixes this issue. Can you try if that works?
Dave, if that works, can you commit that to the master and release
branches?

Hi,

Thank you both Pat and Utkarsh.

QApplication.activeWindow() appears to just work fine at finding the
main window.  As a fall back looping through
QApplication.topLevelWidgets() and doing a check like this:

   isinstance(wid, PyQt4.QtGui.QMainWindow) and re.search('kitware paraview', wid.windowTitle(), re.IGNORECASE)

works OK too (obviously I'm making an assumption about the title).

Thanks again

Matt Wilkins

Subject: [Paraview] pvserver -display on windows
In-Reply-To: <4BFED1BA.70802@renci.org>
Message-ID: <C82445C3.1637B%kmorel@sandia.gov>

The -display argument is only available for X windows.  It has no meaning for the native displays on Windows or Mac.  If you try to use it on Windows, you should get an error message that the -display argument is unknown and it should list all the arguments available.  As I recall, on windows it actually pops up a dialog box listing the arguments rather than printing them to stdout or stderr.  Perhaps pvserver is hanging because it is waiting for you to hit the OK button on all these dialog boxes which, for some reason, you are not seeing.

Hi All,
I am trying to setup a pvserver on a workstation with 4 cores and 2
gpus. The workstation is running windows 7 64bit, MPICH2 1.2.1p1,  and
ParaView 3.8.0-RC2. Here is my local pvserver command

mpiexec -channel nemesis -n 2 .\pvserver.exe -display :0.0
--use-offscreen-rendering : -n 2 .\pvserver.exe -display :0.1
--use-offscreen-rendering

Somehow the command hangs. Is -display option available in windows? If
so, what is the right way to use it? I was trying to put 2 core + 1 gpu
together. If there is another way to optimize the use of cpu and gpu,
please let me know. Thanks a lot.

Best,

The patch is close but there are a few corrections and since I don't
have a "patch" tool on my windows machine I'll have to try to describe
the corrections here by hand so look carefully rather than trying to
use 'patch' to apply these changes.

Can you be more specific about what you are doing and when it should be suppressed?  Removing the vtkValidPointMask functionality from everything would probably be tedious and disastrous.  Where specifically is it going wrong?  Are you loading a file with a vtkValidPointMask?

Hello,

I am using the fortran library LIB_VTK_IO to do my translations to the
binary xml vtu format and I've been encountering a problem.  When my
unstructured meshes get over a certain size, ~5 million elements, I get the
following error message.  Any ideas?

ERROR: In ..\..\..\src\VTK\IO\vtkXMLUnstructuredDataReader.cxx, line 590

Thanks, Ken.
You are right, the pop up message box shows no -display option in windows.
So for my case, 4 cpu cores and 2 gpus, how shall I set up the pvserver 
to use all the resources?
thanks a lot.

Best,

Hi Utkarsh,

thank you for that hint.
I can see the bounding box now ...

But somehow it does not refresh the whole pipeline.
What do I have to do, that all parts of pipeline are updated before I
write the image. Any idea?

Greetings
Jens

I am very interested in knowing this too. How does Windows control
what goes to which GPU? I am guessing that each GPU is driving a
different monitor? When it is offscreen rendering, how do you control
which card does the rendering?

For offscreen rendering, an application can redirect rendering to a specific GPU
by setting the GPU affinity (e.g. the WGL_NV_gpu_affinity extension).

I don't know if ParaView provides mechanisms to specify GPU affinity.
Hopefully, it will not be much work to add it.

Subject: [Paraview] Bug export vrml from ParaView 3.8.0
Message-ID: <AANLkTil8emEVsV9U3G_erhZ4V9bFqOmFWyVGw-xOmfu0@mail.gmail.com>

As I noticed some weeks ago, VRML format files exported from Paraview 3.8.0
(and 3.8.0 RC2) seems to be wrong: I can't visualize them with any program
(freewrl, mayavi,...).

Thank you

Paraview cannot provide this mechanism because VTK does not.

It will requires some non trivial work on the vtk OpenGL extension
manager and vtkWin32OpenGLRenderWindow part.

This is something I would like the VTK ARB to put on the TODO list.

Alright, I've committed it to master. Dave, can you move this to the
release branch as well, thanks.

commit d48e13e489e35be17a6a881e2f0c94649dec1622
Author: Utkarsh Ayachit <utkarsh.ayachit at kitware.com>
Date:   Fri May 28 09:27:12 2010 -0400

    Removed BUILD_PARAVIEW_PLUGINLIST.

    Removing unnecessary BUILD_PARAVIEW_PLUGINLIST varible. This was
resulting in
    plugins included using PARAVIEW_EXTRA_EXTERNAL_MODULES not being
listed in the
    default list of plugins.

So before

vtkWin32OpenGLRenderWindow

comes online, what is the best practice handling multiple cpu cores and 
multiple gpus on windows?
Thanks a lot.

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView Tiled Display Mode Query
Message-ID: <FF1A7BA9BC7CF24DA3A0D4B9D5E9460C5C18CD18AD@GVW1162EXB.americas.hpqcorp.net>

Hi,

I have ParaView running on a Tiled Display (using instructions from 
https://visualization.hpc.mil/wiki/Paraview_Tiled-Display_Mode). I have setup a number of X 
screens that control the tiled display. I use the options -tdx and -tdy to get Paraview running 
on the tiled display.

This worked fine when all my X screens were of the same size. I have a new setup now. In this 
setup, some X screens are smaller than others (these are on the edges of the Tiled Display). One 
such example Tiled Display is :

+-----------+-----------+-----------+
| 1600x1200 | 1600x1200 | 1600x1200 |
+-----------+-----------+-----------+
<----- :0.0 -----------> <-- :0.1 -->
      3200x1200

( Screen 0 is controlling two displays, and Screen 1 is controlling a single display )

When I now run ParaView (pvserver with mpirun, etc), I don't get the correct image on the tiled 
display (didn't expect it either). I also see error messages like the following --
"""
ICET,0:ERROR: Sizes of src and dest do not agree.
ICET,1:ERROR: Sizes of src and dest do not agree.
"""

Now one question : Is there any way to get such an irregular configuration working ?

One solution could be to configure a separate screen for each display, each of size 1600x1200; if 
done, this would become a "regular" 3x1 configuration and ParaView would run satisfactorily ?

---

Slightly OT: I am running ParaView using VizStack (http://vizstack.sf.net/). This converts node(s)
with GPU(s) into a sharable viz resource. Users can allocate one/more GPUs and run applications 
(such as ParaView) as well as remote viz sessions (TurboVNC/VirtualGL/HP RGS) on them. I'll be 
making a separate announcement on this sometime next week, but you're welcome to try VizStack too!

With VizStack, each user can run independent ParaView sessions on a cluster, with each of them 
using any number of available GPUs. VizStack dynamically configures X servers based on what GPUs 
are allocated to each user. VizStack's ParaView script can run ParaView in "Single Client-Multiple
Server" mode, as well as in "Tiled-Display" mode.

Thanks

My guess is that you'll want to use a filter to get access to the cell
locator.  What's the desired output for this?

You could also fetch the data set to the client and then use the vtk wrapped
classes in paraview.vtk to use the cell locator if the class has been
wrapped but the fetch operation should be used with caution.

Hi,

Would you be able to provide a dataset that fails to be visualized. I have
been unable to replicate the problem locally.

Andy,

Bastian wants to use the cell locator in a python programmable --
which won't involve any fetching.

Bastian,
You can create a cell locator in your programmable filter simply by:

locator = vtk.vtkCellLocator()

Unfortunately some of the locator api is pass by reference and therefore not
wrapped by python.  Bastian, let us know if you run into missing methods
when trying to use the cell locator in python.

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView Tiled Display Mode Query
In-Reply-To: <FF1A7BA9BC7CF24DA3A0D4B9D5E9460C5C18CD18AD@GVW1162EXB.americas.hpqcorp.net>
Message-ID: <C825380A.163E1%kmorel@sandia.gov>

There are some technical nuances here, but the short answer is no.  ParaView does not support tiles of different sizes.  Your idea of treating the 3200x1200 as two 1600x1200 displays is a good one and probably the easiest way to get this to work.

-Ken

Hi,

I have ParaView running on a Tiled Display (using instructions from
https://visualization.hpc.mil/wiki/Paraview_Tiled-Display_Mode). I have setup a number of X
screens that control the tiled display. I use the options -tdx and -tdy to get Paraview running
on the tiled display.

This worked fine when all my X screens were of the same size. I have a new setup now. In this
setup, some X screens are smaller than others (these are on the edges of the Tiled Display). One
such example Tiled Display is :

+-----------+-----------+-----------+
| 1600x1200 | 1600x1200 | 1600x1200 |
+-----------+-----------+-----------+
<----- :0.0 -----------> <-- :0.1 -->
      3200x1200

( Screen 0 is controlling two displays, and Screen 1 is controlling a single display )

When I now run ParaView (pvserver with mpirun, etc), I don't get the correct image on the tiled
display (didn't expect it either). I also see error messages like the following --
"""
ICET,0:ERROR: Sizes of src and dest do not agree.
ICET,1:ERROR: Sizes of src and dest do not agree.
"""

Now one question : Is there any way to get such an irregular configuration working ?

One solution could be to configure a separate screen for each display, each of size 1600x1200; if
done, this would become a "regular" 3x1 configuration and ParaView would run satisfactorily ?

---

Slightly OT: I am running ParaView using VizStack (http://vizstack.sf.net/). This converts node(s)
with GPU(s) into a sharable viz resource. Users can allocate one/more GPUs and run applications
(such as ParaView) as well as remote viz sessions (TurboVNC/VirtualGL/HP RGS) on them. I'll be
making a separate announcement on this sometime next week, but you're welcome to try VizStack too!

With VizStack, each user can run independent ParaView sessions on a cluster, with each of them
using any number of available GPUs. VizStack dynamically configures X servers based on what GPUs
are allocated to each user. VizStack's ParaView script can run ParaView in "Single Client-Multiple
Server" mode, as well as in "Tiled-Display" mode.

Thanks

I then use points(1)

By default the x-axis is the arc-length, which is measured as the sum
of lengths of line segments from the first point, hence it goes from
0-14.

When you change the "X Axis Data" to "Use Data Array" and pick "Points
(1)" you should indeed get the x-axis to range from [-7, 7] unless
your probed data doesn't have any values for y < 0.

I created a wavelet source with default values and the them probed
with a line (0,-7, 0) - (0, 7, 0), and the x-axis (after changing to
Points(1) ) is indeed [-7, 7].

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview with "--stereo"
Message-ID: <4BFFDF7E.8000105@gmx.net>

Hello,

I am using ParaView-3.8.0 (precompiled binaries) for visualizing some
scientific data. A while ago, on this mailing list the option "--stereo"
was mentioned to display the visualization in anaglyph 3D mode.

Technically this works well, but my red/blue stereo glasses do not
correspond to the colors actually used in ParaView. (I need somenthing
of this fashion:
http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Kasuga_Lantern_%28anaglyph_stereo%29.jpeg)

Is there some possibility to adjust the used colors?
And does anybody know whether it is possible to modify parameters like
eye distance etc. for this mode to have a more convenient 3D-effect?

Thank you and have a nice weekend :-)

Regards, Mathias

You can't really change the colors explicitly, but to achieve the
effect you are looking for try:

./bin/paraview --stereo --stereo-type=Anaglyph

Stephen,

There is no built-in solution as far as I know, but the following pipeline may
serve as a guideline:

* Apply ?Extract Block? and ?Merge Blocks? filter for a multi-block data set
* Apply Programmable Filter with the following Python source code:

inp = self.GetInput()
filename = "foo.csv"
FILE = open(filename, "w")
FILE.write("x,y,z, x-velocity\n")
numPoints = inp.GetNumberOfPoints()
vel = inp.GetPointData().GetArray("velocity")
for i in xrange(0, numPoints):
  coords = inp.GetPoint(i)[:3]
  FILE.write(str(coords[0]) + ",")
  FILE.write(str(coords[1]) + ",")
  FILE.write(str(coords[2]) + ",")
  FILE.write(str(vel.GetValue(i * 3)) + "\n")

Hi All,
I have two data sets with different time stamp spacing. I would like to 
visualize an attribute from each data set at the same time step. I would 
like to achieve this by applying TemporalInterpolator first to gain data 
at the desired time step, then applying AppendAttributes to both 
TemporalInterpolator's, i.e.:
root
+ data set 1 ->TemporalInterpolator 1 -> AppendAttributes
+ data set 1 ->TemporalInterpolator 2 -> AppendAttributes
+ AppendAttributes

However, whenever I attached TemporalInterpolator, AppendAttributes 
filter option is gone. Did I do something wrong? Please advise.
Thanks a lot.

Best,
x

Xunlei,

That's a  bug with current VTK/ParaView pipeline. Whenever a temporal
interpolator is involved, it results in the data type from the input's
output to become vtkTemporalDataSet.

Apply "Extract Selection" filter to extract the selected data and then
save data as csv.

Hi Utkarsh,

if I reload the state in paraview-gui it does not refresh ether.
I have to walk through the pipeline (bottom to top) and call "Apply".

Greetings
Jens

Jens,

It would be great if you could post a state to reproduce this issue.

I've been working on a fix for this and when I have it fully tested, I'll let you know.

Subject: [Paraview] XDMF +hyperslab = segfault
Message-ID: <4C0014C2.30806@gmx.de>

Hi,

pv 3.8.0 segfaults if xdmf-files try to load datasets partly from
hdf5-files (using DataItem ItemType="HyperSlab").

This can be done by defining hyperslabs in the xdmf-file and is a very
nice feature if the whole grid is simply to large to fit in memory.

I attached a small example (test.xmf). If you open it in pv 3.8.0 and
select u_with_hyperslab and hit "apply" you should get a segfault.
(http://public.kitware.com/Bug/view.php?id=10775).

This was no problem in 3.6.2. Can anyone try this for Windows or Mac? I
only checked Linux(x86).

Greetings
Jens

1) Save Screeshot as pdf -> works, but I would prefer eps files
2) Save Screeshot in whatever format and convert it to eps -> this
works but the quality of the eps is very bad.

Does anybody have any suggestion? (Linux if possible, but Windows is
also fine).

Thank you in advance!

Another option is to use pdflatex which can take in png files that ParaView
can save a screenshot as.  Not sure if this is what you're looking for
though.

Hi Utkarsh,

The problem is related to bug 10775
(http://public.kitware.com/Bug/view.php?id=10775) and hyperslabs in XDMF.
I attached an example which should reproduce the problems I discribe now:

hyperslab on its own:
pv 3.6.2: loading test.xmf->dataset u_without_hyperslab works fine
pv 3.8.0: loading test.xmf->dataset u_without_hyperslab works fine
pv 3.6.2: loading test.xmf->dataset u_with_hyperslab works fine
=>!! pv 3.8.0: loading test.xmf->dataset u_with_hyperslab _segfaults_

hyperslab and "Load/Save State":
pv 3.6.2: loading test_nohyper.pvsm works fine (contour is visible)
pv 3.8.0: loading test_nohyper.pvsm works fine (contour is visible)
=>! pv 3.6.2: loading test_withhyper.pvsm fails (contour _NOT_ visible)
=>!! pv 3.8.0: loading test_withhyper.pvsm _segfaults_

XDMF+hyperslab never worked with "Load State". pv 3.6.2 loads the
pipeline but does not load the hyperslab-dataset. pv 3.8.0 segfaults as
it does loading hyperslab-datasets anyway.

I hope you can reproduce the behaviour (the bugreport also has a
backtrace attached).
It would be great, if this problem could be fixed. But I am happy now to
know its the hyperslab .. that's the first step to a bugfix :)

Greetings
Jens

When you save an image of a 3D image, it is a raster image regardless whether you save it in pdf.  As such, you are much better off saving as a png file where the resolution is explicit.  You can then convert it (with, for example, ImageMagick) to any format that you chose and keep that resolution.

If you are interested, here are posted a collection of CMake macros that will manage a LaTeX build and convert image formats as necessary.

Jens,

I'd recommend not relying on Xdmf state loading or Python API in 3.6
(or before) since that was broken. It has since been fixed for 3.8. I
have requested the ARL/Xdmf folks to take a look at the hyperslab
issue. I'll keep you posted. Once that segfault is fixed, state
loading should not be an issue.

I used the approach Andy suggested very successfully (it can also take a PDF
as an image). I am guessing you are taking screenshots of the 3D scene and
including them in papers/reports.

Any specific reason you prefer eps files? PV is only going to give you 
raster images, so eps isn't an advantage as far as I can tell.

I think you can get quite good results with png's. Save your PV image in 
.png format (File-Save Screen Shot), in as high resolution as you can. 
In other words, make the PV window large. You have to have 
\usepackage{graphicx} or \usepackage[pdftex]{color,graphicx} or 
something similar at the start of your LaTeX file. Use width option of 
the \includegrahics command to get the image the right size in your 
document. I use Kile 2.0 editor and it inserts all the bounding box and 
other info correctly, which is very nice feature.

Thanks Andi,

I will do this. What I am planning to do is to create a scalr field with some distance information as an output.

Another issue: I want to loop oder a multi-block dataset with an iterator in a programmable filter (works) and find out the name of the currently visited block. Is that possible? Thanks.

Regards Bastian

Unfortunately some of the locator api is pass by reference and therefore not wrapped by python.  Bastian, let us know if you run into missing methods when trying to use the cell locator in python.

I need the picture both for reports/papers and for prosper
presentations; in particular, prosper is incompatible with pdflatex,
so I tend to prefer eps figures. Then I first produce dvi files and
then convert them to pdf.

Based on your suggestions, I get good results by the following:
1) take the screeshot as a png file (at high resolution)
2) convert it to eps with imagemagick
3) include the eps figure in the latex file (no pdflatex)
4) convert the resulting dvi document to pdf.
One thing that I didn't notice at first is that, even though the eps
picture seems to have a very low quality, the final pdf document is
nice.

Best,
   Marco

You might consider  LaTeX beamer, I have had great results with it and it
uses pdflatex.

Seems like a reasonable workflow if you need to stick with prosper.

I second Beamer. My colleagues and I have made many presentations with
it. I believe it is the accepted "replacement" of Prosper.

Dear Ken, and dear Utkarsh,

I sent an email for the bug fix. But Kenneth applied it to different location.
Instead of line 148 (which is in UpdateInformationFunction), it was
applied to 172 (which is in UpdateInformationUniform).

So I would like to inform you this again. I believe this issue is also
related to this bug.
I had been fixed on my servers and working well. I am also using state
loadings with sever and client system.

Thank you,
Kenji Takizawa

I have build 3.8.0 (source from paraview.org) yesterday and ran into some minor issues:

- I hat do set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to both my MPI and QT (I have multiple QTs and MPIs installed on this system). RPATH is turned off.
- Afterwards it builds. 
-The Help  misses fome files (e.g. filters). I did make && make HTMLDocumentation && make install. Has something changed about the html documentation? Thanks.

'make HTMLDocumentation' is deprecated, see

If you turn off rpath, then it's essential to set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH
for extra dependencies.

Are you naming the block in the meta-data?  In vtkCompositeDataSet there is
a method called GetMetaData (
http://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkCompositeDataSet.html#abcf79d23fc3a67138da3336e4cda2afe)
that may be what you're looking for.

Thanks Andi,


I don't know since the ensight reader does this for me. I want to work with the input he produces.

Is it in any way possible to link GetMetaData to the current block? Afaik I can not query each blocks meta-Data, can I?


Are you naming the block in the meta-data?  In vtkCompositeDataSet there is a method called GetMetaData (http://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkCompositeDataSet.html#abcf79d23fc3a67138da3336e4cda2afe) that may be what you're looking for.

Subject: [Paraview] Add Icon to a Custom Applications (PV 3.8.0)
Message-ID: <AANLkTilHyGCfszohPvihQjHxC-ZoYLRs-EAfruOTu_wg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,
I have created Qt-based custom visualization applications using ParaView's
Parallel Visualization framework (Version 3.8.0). I am trying to figure out
how to add an icon to this application. I have added these two yellow lines
in my CMakeLists.txt file in order to assign the WinIcon.ico to my
application:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Build the client
build_paraview_client(liuppa_viewer
    TITLE "LIUPPA Viewer (ParaView-based Example Application)"
    ORGANIZATION  "LIUPPA Viewer Coorporation"
    VERSION_MAJOR 1
    VERSION_MINOR 0
    VERSION_PATCH 1
    SPLASH_IMAGE "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/LIUPPAsplash.png"
-->    BUNDLE_ICON   "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/WinIcon.ico"
-->   APPLICATION_ICON  "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/WinIcon.ico"
    REQUIRED_PLUGINS LIUPPAViewerPlugin

    GUI_CONFIGURATION_XMLS
      ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/SupportedReader.xml
)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

No error displayed in compiling and build, but it does not work (still no
icon )
Any advise is much appreciated.

Hi Dave,

Will I fetch a ParaView 3.8.x+bugfix with:
	git clone git://paraview.org/ParaView.git
	git submodule init
	git submodule update
then?

Greetings
Jens



Greetings,

There are a couple of gradient filters in ParaView (Gradient and Gradient of
Unstructured DataSet in the filters menu).  The one to use depends on the
input grid you have.  The Mesh Quality filter can be used to get the volume
of tet and hex cells.

The following example shows how to create an iterator to iterate over
all blocks in a composite dataset. The iterator
(http://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkCompositeDataIterator.html)
has methods like HasCurrentMetaData(), GetCurrentMetaData() that you
can use to get the meta-data for the current block. Note that by
default the iterator skips over non-leaf nodes. If you want to access
those, use VisitOnlyLeavesOff() on the iterator.

Hi All,

I have some trouble when building ParaView3.8.0 from the source on a 
Windows7 64bit machine with MSVC2008. Here are two errors out of many 
for vtkIO. Is windows.h being included prior to ws2def.h and WinSock2.h 
somewhere? Does anyone have a remedy for them? Thanks a lot.
Error    4    error C2011: 'sockaddr' : 'struct' type redefinition

Hi,

Typing 'import PyQt4.QtGui' into the python shell in paraview 3.8.0 on
Windows XP fails with:

>>> import PyQt4.QtGui
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<console>", line 1, in <module>
ImportError: DLL load failed: This application has failed to start because the application configuration is incorrect. Reinstalling the application may fix this problem.
>>> 

I haven't had paraview on this machine before, in fact I just installed
paraview for the first time on this windows machine.  The machine does have
python and VTK on it, but I have removed my PYTHONPATH environment variable,
and any references to those directories from my PATH.  Still the problem remains.

3.8.0\bin\vistrails too since there is a QTGUI4.dll in there too.

Does anyone have any clues?

Hi,

Under 3.6.2 on linux in the python shell GetSources() fails if there are
sources in the pipeline browser that appeared from Custom Filters.  The error
is:

>>> GetSources()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<console>", line 1, in <module>
  File "/home/kitware/ParaView3/Utilities/BuildScripts/ParaView-3.6/ParaView3Bin/Utilities/VTKPythonWrapping/paraview/simple.py", line 195, in GetSources
  File "/home/kitware/ParaView3/Utilities/BuildScripts/ParaView-3.6/ParaView3Bin/Utilities/VTKPythonWrapping/paraview/servermanager.py", line 1493, in GetProxiesInGroup
  File "/home/kitware/ParaView3/Utilities/BuildScripts/ParaView-3.6/ParaView3Bin/Utilities/VTKPythonWrapping/paraview/servermanager.py", line 1704, in next
  File "/home/kitware/ParaView3/Utilities/BuildScripts/ParaView-3.6/ParaView3Bin/Utilities/VTKPythonWrapping/paraview/servermanager.py", line 2280, in _getPyProxy

KeyError: 'Foo'
>>> 

What I am doing is creating a Custom Filter (Foo) by: selecting two filters I
have applied, clicking on Create Custom Filter, then taking all the defaults
(clicking through Next Next Next, then Finished).  Then I apply that custom
filter, then run a GetSources() in the python shell and the above error
appears.

I friend tried the above with 3.8.0 on Windows with similar results.
I don't completely trust he did it right, but he probably did, so the
problem is probably not limited to 3.6.2 on linux.

Have I done something wrong with my Custom Filter?

Thank you very much for any help you can offer.

Note that I have a variable logfr that enables me to select a specific 
surface using threshold.
logfr=-3 on the cylinder surface and 0 at interior points, 5 at farfiled 
boundaries.
The axis of my cylinder is the z-direction.

*These are the steps that I follow:*

click and activate "extract surface"
click and activate "connectivity"
click and activate "threshold"
set lower threshold = -3
set upper threshold = -3
*apply to see cylinder surface*
click and activate "slice"
select z-normal, deactivate show plane
*should see center plane circle*
click and activate "plot on sorted lines"
 use display to activate only the pressure
by default the pressure vs arclength will be shown
it is not clear which x,y point the arclength starts
in the box "X-Axis Data"
select Use Data Array "points 0"
gives a better plot.
Note that I need deselect pressure and reselect it again to get the plot 
(a bug?)
use save data to get a csv file.
Stephen
p.s.
I have used it successfully with spheres and cylinders.

when the timer is triggered and the server reports that data is ready, we do a number of bookkepping taks, and then update the pipeline/representation and other stuff using server manager objects like so...

    this->Reader->InvokeCommand("Modified");
    this->Reader->UpdatePropertyInformation();
    this->Reader->UpdateVTKObjects();
    this->Reader->UpdatePipeline();

and finally after more stuff ... trigger a render ...


    if (pqActiveObjects::instance().activeView())
    {
      pqActiveObjects::instance().activeView()->render();
    }

This has been working fine for some months, but recently, we've been getting strange errors which look like the paraview client is interacting with the server manager, at the same time as we are triggering updates. A classic threading type problem. [We have added another thread to pvserver which accepts data from the simulation via its own socket communicator, this appears stable as we can do much stuff without forcing updates in the pvclient gui and we get no errors, these threads reside only inside pvserver ]

Within a Qt+ParaView framework, can anyone tell me if it is "safe" to Update pipelines from the server manager within a timer triggered slot. Is there an existing example of anything similar which updates server manager objects from a timer - also forcing renders. I know that rendering should be triggered from the gui thread only - should this be removed from the Qtimer slot.

Any feedback welcome.

Thanks

JB

It doesn't look like it has anything to do with enabling/disabling
Icet, although why would you want to do that? IceT is what ParaView
uses for parallel rendering, without which parallel rendering won't
work. Besides, IceT is enabled only when you are compiling with MPI.

As far as cmd.exe issue goes, this may help:

Matt,

I just tried the same with current git-master (should be same as 3.8
as far as python stuff is concerned). It seems to work just fine:

>>> from paraview.simple import *
paraview version 3.9.0, Date: 2010-05-21
>>> GetSources()
{('Sphere1', '105'): <paraview.servermanager.Sphere object at 0x4c3ffd0>,
 ('TwoShrinks1', '1111'): <paraview.servermanager.TwoShrinks object at
0x4c3fb10>}
>>>

Let me know if it doesn't work with  3.8 for you.

Hello,

I juste found this method : vtk.vtkXMLStructuredGridWriter.SetTimeStep

What should be the names of files in order the reader recognize them ?

Did you compile ParaView yourself? I suspect that you did not and that
the Python ParaView includes is different than the one PyQt4 was
compiled against. If that is the case, you have to compile ParaView
yourself, against the Python as well as Qt PyQt4 uses.

Hi,
Thanks.
I tried the link which you had sent, but I didnt have the problem which
the person was having.
Is the problem related to visual studio and not paraview as then I will
try other versions of it.
Thanks

Yes, it's a visual studio issue. You might want to google around to
try to find what's missing in your setup.

It is possible that the timer times out in middle of a progress event
which happens while filters are executing.

Sorry, I just see your answer. Sure I can.

I have many files to read, that are so called :

   - file.vts001 ----------> timestep 1
   - file.vts002 ----------> timestep 2
   - etc...

And I do some of my work in the python shell, using the VTK library.
I need to access to the different timesteps.

Up to now, I were using a function that looks like :

def reader(timestep):
> r = vtkXMLStructuredGridReader()
> r.SetFileName('file.vts%s'%(timestep))
> r.Update()
> return r.GetOutput()            or              GetOutputPort()
>

Is this what the reader method "SetTimestep" is made for ?

Thanks Utkarsh,

the required information is in MetaData:

print iter.GetCurrentMetaData()

vtkInformation (0x3808f00)
Debug: Off
Modified Time: 269417
Reference Count: 2
Registered Events: (none)
DONT_PRUNE: 1
NAME: my_given_name

Now I want to work with the NAME-Attribute (my_given_name) but I don't
know how to get this into a variable? I can't find a GetName()-Method...

print dir(iter.GetCurrentMetaData())

['AddObserver', 'Append', 'AppendUnique', 'BreakOnError', 'Clear',
'Copy', 'CopyEntries', 'CopyEntry', 'DebugOff', 'DebugOn', 'FastDelete',
'Get', 'GetAddressAsString', 'GetClassName', 'GetDebug',
'GetGlobalWarningDisplay', 'GetKey', 'GetMTime', 'GetNumberOfKeys',
'GetReferenceCount', 'GetRequest', 'GlobalWarningDisplayOff',
'GlobalWarningDisplayOn', 'Has', 'HasObserver', 'InvokeEvent', 'IsA',
'IsTypeOf', 'Length', 'Modified', 'NewInstance', 'PrintRevisions',
'Register', 'Remove', 'RemoveAllObservers', 'RemoveObserver',
'RemoveObservers', 'SafeDownCast', 'Set', 'SetDebug',
'SetGlobalWarningDisplay', 'SetReferenceCount', 'SetRequest', 'UnRegister']

Thanks for help.

Subject: [Paraview] Add Icon to a Custom Applications (PV 3.8.0)

Before I can suggest a possible fix, can you elaborate what exactly do
you expect the result to be? The APPLICATION_ICON and BUNDLE_ICON are
used to define the default icon used by Explorer on Windows and Finder
on MAC when showing the application (.exe on Windows and .app on Mac).
 If you want the icon to show  up in the top-left corner of the wndow,
then you need to set the icon as the windowIcon on your QMainWindow
(you can do that in the Qt designer as well).

Hi Ken, Kenji and Jens,

I pulled the fix to UpdateInformationUniform that Ken committed into
ParaView a few weeks ago. I just now also applied the fix to
UpdateInformationFunction and pulled the change into ParaView as well.

I apologize for some of the confusion. Since the transition to Git, Xdmf
work is done on master and has to be manually pulled onto the 'pv' branch
that ParaView uses due to structural issues with Xdmf and how it was
circumvented using CVS symlinks.

Anyway, Please let myself or Ken know if there are any more problems.

Thanks!

OK. This we have detected, though what progress is going on I'm unsure about (!) - by which I mean that the only thing paraview should be doing is updating our stuff and we block more updates whilst one is happening.

Question : Is there a mutex of any kind on the update vtk objects, or update pipeline stuff which we can make use of to ensure that only one pull from the server occurs at any given time?

Hey Bastian,

I think you should be able to just use the Get() method to pull out that information key. When I want to find current time step information on some pipeline data (with a programmable filter), which has information that looks like this:

vtkInformation (0x11dd723d0)
Debug: Off
Modified Time: 70754
Reference Count: 2
Registered Events: (none)
DATA_NUMBER_OF_GHOST_LEVELS: 0
DATA_TIME_STEPS: 0
DATA_PIECE_NUMBER: 0
DATA_EXTENT_TYPE: 0
DATA_NUMBER_OF_PIECES: 1

I can do it with these commands:

pdi = self.GetInputDataObject(0,0)
current_time = pdi.GetInformation().Get(pdi.DATA_TIME_STEPS(),0)

So you might be able to just put NAME() in where I put DATA_TIME_STEPS().

Talk to you later,
-Eric

Look at pqProgressManager::setProgress(). It sets InUpdate before the
progress signal  is fired. You can check if InUpdate is true to avoid
timing out when a update is happening. InUpdate is not public, you may
have to expose it.

Hi,

I'm facing an error under the client-server mode. As soon as I try to open a file, paraview crashes with this error on the
server side :

ERROR: In /home/podallaire/ParaView/Servers/Common/vtkProcessModule.cxx, line 1065
vtkProcessModule (0x851da0): Cannot create object of type "vtk1DTransferFunctionFilter".
while processing
Message 0 = New
  Argument 0 = string_value {vtk1DTransferFunctionFilter}
  Argument 1 = id_value {387}


ERROR: In /home/podallaire/ParaView/Servers/Common/vtkProcessModule.cxx, line 1066
vtkProcessModule (0x851da0): Aborting execution for debugging purposes.

....


Any idea what is going on ? I tried different files - same result.

Regards,

PO

Hi,

Perhaps I am doing something wrong, because I am getting different
behaviour to you Utkarsh.

I have not tried the current git-master, just 3.6.2 and 3.8.0.

With 3.8.0 GetSources() only works if I make the custom filter, then
restart paraview and apply it.  If I apply the custom filter
immediately after making it, GetSources() craps out with the KeyError
as below.

With 3.6.2 GetSources() always craps out, regardless of whether I
restart paraview or not.

To make the custom filter I just make two filters, select them both,
go to Tools -> Create Custom Filter, give it a name, then hit Next
Next Finished.  I don't do anything more than that.  Is there some
other step I am missing perhaps?

Thanks

Matt Wilkins

Hi,

I just built paraview from the latest git repo, same as with 3.8.0.

OK, so I must be doing something wrong with my Custom Filter.  Or did
you not try the GetSources() before doing a restart with paraview?

"Annotation" page. There you can change the outline color and  text
color for the axes. You can set to be "interactive" and the move it to
the location you want or change the size. You cannot, however change
the color of the axes themselves.

Is there a way to reduce the number of invalid points? And is it correct

filter, and in pvpython, I don't get the same result ... !

 from paraview import vtk

i = self.GetInput()

b = i.GetBlock(1)

c = vtk.vtkArrayCalculator()

c.SetInput(b)

c.SetFunction('1.4')

c.SetResultArrayName('test')

c.Update()

print c.GetOutput().GetPointData().GetArray('test').GetTuple1(1)

in pvpython ---> 1.4
in paraview ---> 1.0

Could someone reproduce this ?
