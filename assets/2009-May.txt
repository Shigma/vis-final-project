*Hi All,
I'm trying to convert an existing data file into a VTK image data format.
But I always have error :*

Message-ID: <200905011004.58760.alin.elena@ichec.ie>

Hi,


I try to compile paraview CVS with silo plugin on a linux 64 bit machine
opensuse 11.1 with MVAPICH2-0.9.8
 and gnu compilers.

However I get the following error (The same error I get with the 3.4.0 stable 
version, I have attached the CMakeCache.txt too)

We are still waiting on answers but I think that we will drop VS6
support. We didn't look into other compilers yet. Once the dashboard
is clean, let's try this again. It would be a good test to see which
compilers are hopeless and which ones need some work.

I'd recommend turning of the Silo reader. We will remove it and
replace it with another reader in the version.

It's the boundaries from the original simulation. However, running 
through the D3 filter and then doing a cell2point seems to clean up the 
boundary edges.

Thanks

Hi Berk,

Thank you very much for you answer.

It seems that cosmo, pvblot filters fail too for cvs
The cosmo should be something very simple I may have a look into it if I get 
some time.

Anyhow do you have any ET for the silo, as I need the plugin working for one 
of our users. (Try to move some from Visit to Paraview).

Otherwise it compiles fine.
Once installed the binary will complain about missing libs 
 paraview
paraview: error while loading shared libraries: libpqComponents.so: cannot 
open shared object file: No such file or directory
More than sure this has to do with 
-- Removed runtime path from "/usr/local/lib/paraview-3.5/libpqCore.so"

Why is there no uninstall target in the CMakeLists.txt of paravie?


 As a side, I use qt4.5.1   Why is the prefered version for qt still 4.3?

regards,
Alin

Subject: [Paraview] Exodus weirdness

Message-ID: <C6206782.8B6A%kmorel@sandia.gov>

It does not surprise me that D3 helped.  Many codes, Alegra and pretty much anything that writes Exodus files included, drops the connectivity information between processes when writing files.  D3 recovers that information.

Is running cell2point really necessary?  It shouldn't be.  This filter does an averaging of the field values at each point, which results in loss of the high frequency information.  If there is a problem with data between process data, cell2point could simply be hiding it with this averaging.

Granted, showing cell data often looks "blocky," and that should be OK.  However, if you notice a discontinuity that you can trace around the simulation process boundaries, that might be cause for concern.  It could be that the simulation is artificially introducing artifacts on the process boundaries, which in turn can skew all the results of the simulation.

OK, without D3 you will always see the processor boundaries. Paraview is see all the individual .exo files as independent, until you apply D3. CleanToGrid takes points that are essentially on top of each other and merges them. Nodes on processor boundaries are written to both exodus files, so before CleanToGrid you have, effectively, double valued nodes at processor boundaries; even though the nodes are at the same location, and the values are actually the same (if we wrote them out correctly) Paraview is probably trying to interpolate between them somehow.

CellToPoint can hide the discrepancy by slightly smoothing the data when interpolating from cells to points.

These are possible and sensible explanations, but without seeing the data we can't be sure. Try D3 and CleanToGrid, and if you can still see processor boundaries we would want to look deeper, if that's possible.

I will re-investigate the data to determine if D3 and then CleanToGrid 
does the trick.

The reader expects the whole extent to be integer ranges. I believe these
are meant to be index ranges, not "real-world" ranges.

Which version of Paraview?  of VTK?  You'll probably want CVS in both
cases.  Also, see:

Subject: [Paraview] Some paraview python questions
Message-ID: <c19fcadc0905021401i1bb83316tf19355467399537d@mail.gmail.com>

1) Adding a view after adding a source with python
I have the following script which adds a sphere to the pipeline browser

#!/usr/bin/pvpython
#must be run from inside paraview!

from paraview import servermanager

sphere = servermanager.sources.Sphere()
pm=servermanager.ProxyManager()
pm.RegisterProxy("sources","mysource",sphere)

This adds "mysource" to the pipeline browser. According to the wiki, it
sounds like the default visibility should be off, but you should just be
able to click the "eye" next to it to actually display the object. However,
I am not seeing an eye at all, not even a disabled one. (
http://rpi.edu/~doriad/NoEye.jpg <http://rpi.edu/%7Edoriad/NoEye.jpg>)

2) The command history (ie. pressing the up arrow to get to previous
commands) does not seem to work in the python shell inside paraview. Can it
be enabled?

3) I can access all of the open sources with this:

p=pm.GetProxiesInGroup("sources").items()
then get a single source with
a=p[0] #up to p[len(p)-1]

When I dir(a), there are no properties (such as visibility) listed. How do
you change that type of property? (the idea would be to something such as
iterate through all of the open items one at a time and save screen shots).

Any help would be great!

Thanks,

David

Wouldn't it be easier to treat z as t. So instead of multiple vtk
files, you could create one vtk file where the third axis represents
time. You could then use slice or extract subset filters to get the
plane that you want. You can do something similar for a file series
but you would have to write a custom filter in C++ (Python would not
do).

Hi!
Paraview can read in timeseries, but is there any possibility for a filter to get as input all the files of the timeseries? 
that would be helpful,
thx,

Also, just a quick observation...


CleanToGrid = Intraprocessor clean up of coincident node points
D3 = Interprocessor clean up of coincident node points (through the use of ghost cells).


So I think (I might be corrected) the correct order to do these is CleanToGrid first and then D3. D3 will then have less data to hoist around (by it's nature D3 is a more heavyweight process so any data reduction you can do is good).

I will re-investigate the data to determine if D3 and then CleanToGrid does the trick.

Actually, I don't think you should have to run CleanToGrid at all.  D3 should be merging all coincident points, both locally and globally.  The one exception is if the global ids in the Exodus file is wrong.  If you think that might be an issue, try turning off the global ids in the Exodus reader.

Another potential solution is to make a filter that loads all the timesteps from the upstream pipeline and merge their geometry together.  No such filter exists right now, but it would be straightforward to implement.

Sean,

I was/am using the cvs source (updated this morning). I think the  
problem was just that I forgot to apply the VTK-bug-7818-patch.txt. I  
appear to have a working 64-bit paraview with a 64-bit python  
interpreter running from the build directory now.

The install target still tries to put a stand alone bundle in / 
Applications, regardless of the value of CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX. If I  
set the DESTDIR environment variable, then it tries to put it in  
DESTDIR/CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX, which means I get something like /opt/ 
local/opt/local.  Does  anybody know how to properly get a paraview  
executable in CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX? I don't really need a  bundle,  
just one that uses the libraries and binaries installed in  
$CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/lib/paraview-3.5. I suppose I could set  
CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX to ' /' and DESTDIR to /opt/local.

Thanks,
Chris

Message-ID: <EB7CB6ED-86B3-4AC8-9C1A-0AEB290BE6D2@usace.army.mil>

Hi all,

Is there an easy way to do a complete vtk installation directly from  
the paraview source? I'd like to get what a direct vtk install usually  
puts in lib/vtk-5.3 and include/vtk-5.3 so that my vtk-based  
applications can use the result of paraview build instead of requiring  
that I build vtk AND paraview.

Thanks,
Chris

The VTK time support is documented in a 2007 IEEE Vis paper.  I don't know if it is documented any better elsewhere.  You can get the paper from here.

  http://www.cs.unm.edu/~kmorel/documents/TimeVis-IEEE2007.html

I also implemented a very simple filter to merge the time steps like you want.  The source, complete with plugin, is attached to this message.  The attachment may or may not make it to the paraview users' list.

The VTK source is under the ParaView3 source directory and as far as I know
pulled directly from the VTK cvs repository.  You should be able to do a
separate VTK installation with:
ccmake <ParaView3 directory>/VTK

Subject: [Paraview] Ensight Particle data visualization
Message-ID: <de38a3c20905041735r516aa54chaf84d2d96eb18e39@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am trying to visualize particle data files, written in Ensight Gold
format. I checked the case file with ens_checker82 and it seems okay to me.

FORMAT
type: ensight gold
GEOMETRY
model: 1 DF.000000.ens.coor
measured: 2 lsp2.******.ens.coor
VARIABLE
vector per node: 1 U ./DF.******.ens.U
vector per measured node: 2 UP ./lsp2.******.ens.UP
scalar per measured node: 2 TP ./lsp2.******.ens.TP
scalar per measured node: 2 MP ./lsp2.******.ens.MP
TIME
time set: 1
number of steps: 2
filename start number: 1
filename increment: 1
time values:
1.00E-002
2.00E-002
time set: 2
number of steps: 2
filename start number: 1
filename increment: 1
time values:
1.00E-002
2.00E-002

While trying to read it in Paraview3.4, I am getting following error
messages:

ERROR: In /tmp/Kitware/ParaView3/VTK/IO/vtkEnSightReader.cxx, line 1950
vtkEnSightGoldBinaryReader (0xba8b610): Block already has a vtkDataSet
assigned to it.

I am able to visualize particles by using Glyph filter as mentioned in the
earlier posts but the particle size doesn't look physical to me. I should
have all my particles with dia 6e-5m but Paraview displays them with
different sizes. In the Scalars section I have selected MP, and Vector as U.
I changed the default radius of 0.5 to 0.05 and Scale mode is set to vector.
Also, the number of points in information section is way too more than what
I have in my files. I would really appreciate any help in understanding
Paraview particle visualization.

Thanks
Sandeep

P.S : I have the particle image attached for reference.

Hi Sandeep:

   Would you please try your EnSight Gold data files using the latest
version of ParaView? If the problem still exists, I will be glad to fix it.
I mean there has been much difference between ParaView3.4 (that you are
using) and the latest version regarding EnSight Gold files.

   Thanks.

Hi Jacques,

We need to develop a higher level interface to access the block
information from the client. This is on our plate for the next
release. I am guessing that you want to select blocks by name?

That's right !

By the way, can someone clarify what the difference is between :

from paraview.simple import *
and
from paraview import servermanager

The two servermanagers do not behave in the same way !
For example the ensight reader in one is :
servermanager.sources.ensight
servermanager.sources.EnsightReader

Look at vtkTemporalInterpolator. That has code for requesting multiple
timesteps from the input.

Message-ID: <c19fcadc0905050601t27da96e1ga12f02f5d0614374@mail.gmail.com>

If I open a small model (bounding box edge length about .1) and add vector
glyphs of the normals, the "scale factor" changes to 397794.090337098 and
hence the arrows are ENORMOUS and it makes the model look like a single
point. If I check "Edit", change the scale factor to .1, and hide then show
the model (to reset the zoom), it looks correct. Is there a way to get the
scale factor to default to an appropriate value?

Thanks,

David

I recently (yesterday) posted this plugin to the mailing list.  It contains a filter that collects all of the timesteps if its input and merges them together.  If you don't want the steps merged, it is a trivial change to just output the data as blocks.

Hey David,

1.) When you create a new source, to get it to render you also need to  
create a "Representation" for it in the "View". If you're running from  
the python shell inside the paraview gui, you need to do something  
like this:

sphere = servermanager.sources.Sphere()
pm = servermanager.ProxyManager()
pm.RegisterProxy('sources','mysource',sphere)
view = servermanager.GetRenderView()
sphereRep = servermanager.CreateRepresentation(sphere,view)
pm.RegisterProxy('representations','mysourceRep',sphereRep)

After that last step the "eye" should show up (and the sphere should  
show up in the main render view.

2.) I'm not sure why the arrows don't work any more for the command  
history. In PV 3.4 it works for me, but not in CVS. It's very  
irritating...

3.) It's the Representation Proxy that contains things like  
visibility, not the source proxy itself. dir(sphereRep) will show you  
the options.

sphereRep.Visibility = 0

To iterate through all the representations you can do something like  
this:

for k, v in pm.GetProxiesInGroup('representations').iteritems():
     v.Visibility = 0

Hope this helps,
-Eric

This is bug number 5659.  Frankly, this has been a topic of debate for a while, since the solution is not trivial.

The problem is that ParaView creates a good scale for your glyph, using data from time step 0.  But, at time step 1, the data can be totally different.  For instance, if you use displacement from time step 0, displacement will be very near zero for time step 0, and (relative to time step zero) orders of magnitude larger for time step 1.

The same problem occurs with setting colors for variables, as well as 2d plot scales.

One option is to start using the last time step to create these scales, realizing that this will slow down the initial load times of large data.

Alan, I don't follow. There is only time 0 in this example, so shouldn't the
scale be well defined and constant? Bug 5659 seems to be dealing with the
problem of glyph sizes not updating properly, this is dealing with them not
being correct from the beginning.

Thanks, that worked. With that approach I still have to do a build of  
VTK and  and a build of paraview (which also builds its own vtk) so I  
get two copies of the vtk libraries installed. I was hoping to go one  
step further and have paraview use the  version of vtk I use for  
everything else.  It's not that big of deal though. I can live with  
two sets of vtk libraries.

I will give it a try next week.

Odly enough I just finished fixing this bug today, with a patch for the 
visibility issue at http://www.vtk.org/Bug/view.php?id=8958

The locking bug it self can be fixed by simply changing one line.

I know what the reason is.
I have originally submitted the bug under 'Paraview' project, then 
realizing that the last posts before were the previous year, and in 
addition seeing also project 'Paraview3', I concluded that the former 
must be referring to 2.x branch or so - and I resubmitted to the latter, 
where also the earlier posts were just days before.
To some extent I may be called guilty, but the 2 actual Paraview 
projects are very confusing.
Many thanks - and sorry. I only hope you two can agree on a better 
solution. I can test whatever you conclude with.
thanks and regards,
Dominik

Robert,

What your patch is doing is exactly what I've done, except at the server
manager level (so in vtkSMScalarBarRepresentationProxy instead of
pqScalarBarRepresentation). I guess I am going to mark bug #8958 resolved,
unless someone tells me otherwise :).

For this all you need to do when cmake asks you for the location of VTK is
to put in:
 <paraview3 install directory>/VTK

Subject: [Paraview] Filter Plugin w/ multiple connections
Message-ID: <alpine.DEB.1.00.0905051744560.19620@WKAN>

Hello,


What is the proper way to write a filter plugin for paraview w/ multiple
connections and access the data from each connection?


I have been trying to use the vtkProgrammableFilter,
vtkPythonProgrammableFilter, vtkMultiBlockDataGroupFilter, and
vtkTemporalStaticsFilter as examples.


int vtkMyFilterPlugin::RequestData(
   vtkInformation *vtkNotUsed(request),
   vtkInformationVector **inputVector,
   vtkInformationVector *outputVector)
{

   int numInputs = inputVector[0]->GetNumberOfInformationObjects();
   for (int idx = 0; idx < numInputs; ++idx)
     {
      vtkInformation *inInfo = inputVector[0]->GetInformationObject(idx);

      vtkDataObject *input = vtkDataObject::GetData(inInfo);

      vtkDataSet *inputDataSet  = vtkDataSet::SafeDownCast( input) ;

      .
      .
      .
}

where numInputs = the number of connections to my Filter.
vtkDataSet::SafeDownCast(input) returns a NULL pointer when I have
multiple connections to the filter but works for ONE connection.
How do I get the pointer(s) that will let me access the vtkDataArray
for each connection to my filter? ie

      vtkPointData *pd=inputDataSet->GetPointData();
      int numArrays = pd->GetNumberOfArrays();
      for (int i = 0; i < numArrays; i++)
        {
          vtkDataArray *array = pd->GetArray(i);
        }


thanks,
df

Hi all,

I was just reading the *[Paraview] Tiled display with multi-gpu.* thread from
April 20th, and i was just wondering if i can perform over a tiled display
with this multi gpu trick a stereo visualization.



Thanks.

Robert,

On further consideration, I've decided to go with your patch. I've committed
it to CVS (slightly modified to remove the signal changes).
Attached is a patch for the final version that made it in.

Hi Sandeep:

  If possible and convenient, would you please report the problem via the
Mantis (http://paraview.org/Bug/my_view_page.php) by describing the
procedure used to re-produce the problem and the data files involved?

  I will look into it.

  Thanks.

Subject: [Paraview] Filter Plugin w/ multiple connections
In-Reply-To: <alpine.DEB.1.00.0905051744560.19620@WKAN>
Message-ID: <C6270C09.8DA3%kmorel@sandia.gov>

There are two parts to making this work.  The first part is supporting multiple ports and/or connections in the filter itself.  To set the number of input ports, you call this->SetNumberOfInputPorts() in the filter's constructor.  To set the number of connections allowed on each port, you override the FillInputPortInformation method and add the appropriate flags to the information object.  The specifics are documented at the beginning of Chapter 13 (How to Write an Algorithm for VTK) in the latest VTK User's Guide book.

The second part is to announce the input ports and/or connections in the server manager XML.  To set multiple ports, provide multiple InputProperty elements, one for each input.  These are easiest to set up if you provide convenience methods for each port in your filter that call SetInputConnection with the appropriate port number.  The arguments for the InputProperty tag provide information about ports that support multiple connections and optional ports.  The ParaView Guide book provides some documentation on the XML structure and the ParaView3/Servers/ServerManager/Resources/filters.xml source file provides plenty of examples.  The ArbitrarySourceStreamTracer, labeled "Stream Tracer (Custom Source)", provides good examples of both multiple ports and ports that support multiple connections.

Hello,


What is the proper way to write a filter plugin for paraview w/ multiple

I have been trying to use the vtkProgrammableFilter,
vtkPythonProgrammableFilter, vtkMultiBlockDataGroupFilter, and
vtkTemporalStaticsFilter as examples.


int vtkMyFilterPlugin::RequestData(
   vtkInformation *vtkNotUsed(request),
   vtkInformationVector **inputVector,
   vtkInformationVector *outputVector)
{

   int numInputs = inputVector[0]->GetNumberOfInformationObjects();
   for (int idx = 0; idx < numInputs; ++idx)
     {
      vtkInformation *inInfo = inputVector[0]->GetInformationObject(idx);

      vtkDataObject *input = vtkDataObject::GetData(inInfo);

      vtkDataSet *inputDataSet  = vtkDataSet::SafeDownCast( input) ;

      .
      .
      .
}

where numInputs = the number of connections to my Filter.
vtkDataSet::SafeDownCast(input) returns a NULL pointer when I have
multiple connections to the filter but works for ONE connection.
How do I get the pointer(s) that will let me access the vtkDataArray
for each connection to my filter? ie

      vtkPointData *pd=inputDataSet->GetPointData();
      int numArrays = pd->GetNumberOfArrays();
      for (int i = 0; i < numArrays; i++)
        {
          vtkDataArray *array = pd->GetArray(i);
        }


thanks,

Subject: [Paraview] Grid seeds for streamlines?
Message-ID: <493326.30859.qm@web26604.mail.ukl.yahoo.com>


Instead of using random points or a line for seeds when doing streamlines, is it possible to do this from a grid? I know I can do it many times with lines, and save these as custom filters, but each time I save then load custom filters I have to re-enter all  the data about line widths, colors, etc.

Thanks in advance,

Martin

There is a second stream tracer filter called a "Stream Tracer (Custom Source)" will use as seed points any geometric object that you feed it.  Although the interface is not perfect, it should get you what you want.  One approach is to slice your data and then use the slice as the seed points.  Another approach is to create a plane source and use that as seed points.

I was just looking to see if there was an easy way of doing this, as  
well.  All things are possible from the python interface, it would  
seem, but it would be great if there were an easy way to do this from  
the GUI.

I've been working on a new class called vtkRegularGridSource and a 
widget to control it derived from BoxWidgetRepresentation plus 
pqRegularGridSourceWidget, it allows a 2D/3D grid to be defined via the 
gui (same as one would for line source for example) - it doesn't have to 
be axis aligned and can be rotated, scaled etc using the box widget. 
Once it's ready, it should be relatively easy to inject it into the gui 
along with other widgets so that the streamline filter (for example) can 
have it in the widget selection box for inputs.

It is mostly working in my own paraview tree, but will be commited to 
cvs after 3.6 is out of the door I expect.

Thanks alot Ken,


When you highlight multiple datasets for input into a
filter, is that multiple ports or multiple connections on one port ?

Subject: [Paraview] Append DataSet Filter and Exodus Files
Message-ID: <alpine.DEB.1.00.0905061500120.19620@WKAN>

Hi,


Is there a way to make the Append DataSet Filter work with exodus files?
I have several that I want to append to use the calculator on.


I tried modifying the source to create a plugin

VTK/Graphics/vtkAppendFilter.cxx

but I always seem to be getting a null pointer from the SafeDownCast?

   vtkInformation *inInfo = inputVector[0]->GetInformationObject(idx);
   vtkDataSet *ds vtkDataSet::SafeDownCast(inInfo->Get(vtkDataObject::DATA_OBJECT()));




thank you,
David Fuentes

I am pretty sure that is multiple connections on a single port.

Subject: [Paraview] setting graphical window size
Message-ID: <4A027181.8010609@gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm using to paraview to create screenshots of multiple sets of data
(12+). Each dataset is located in a separate file and may have different
boundary conditions or different surfaces. (i.e. they are not identical
- although they *might* have elements in common and their domain size is
the same). I've written a simple script (below) using python to set my
camera angle the same between loading the state for each scenario

However, I have one difficulty, if I have exited paraview or resized the
windows (or .#%#@.. it crashed ) the size & aspect ratio of the window
displaying my 3D view may change. This results in my screenshots have
differing resolutions i.e. my first series had 1198x712 but my next was
1106x780. I know you can specify this resolution in the save screenshot
dialog - however this is after the fact and some elements seem to differ
based on the real size (i.e. legends)

I can't seem to find an option to specify the size of this window, but I
assume I may be able to via python ? can anyone help with this ?

Also would love to know how to move the location of the orientation axes ?

For reference, I am not a python programmer ( but can program C, C++,
Fortran ... ) so forgive any style mistakes.

Thanks, John

My quick script to set camera state is: (iso_L.py)
#!/usr/bin/env python

from paraview.servermanager import *
if not servermanager.ActiveConnection:
    connection = servermanager.Connect()
view = servermanager.GetRenderView()
camera = view.GetActiveCamera()
view.CameraPosition=[0.5,-4,4]
view.CameraFocalPoint=[2.915, 0, 0.821]
view.CameraViewUp=[0, 0, 1]
view.CameraViewAngle=30
#view.ResetCamera()
view.StillRender()

The exodus reader is no doubt exporting multiblock data, so the 
SafeDownCast will fail. Add an extra test for Multiblock and then use an 
iterator to loop over blocks and then safedowncast and do what you need

Hi John,

Is it view.ViewSize you are looking for?
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Python_Scripting#Take_a_Screenshot_of_a_VTP_File
That is in my "outside paraview" area, which means I've only tried it from a
terminal, running the script with
pvpython ./script.py

I'm not sure if it will work inside python, but let me know if it does / if
that's what you needed.


Thanks,
Dave

Thanks for the tip. I have created a basic grid, and used this as the source for the Custom Source Stream Tracer. Works just as I need it.

When you write an image, you can specify a resolution to use independent of the size of the GUI.  If you type in the same resolution every time, you should get the same projection.

Message-ID: <20090507135330.GA24081@bromo.med.uc.edu>

   I have taken over as maintainer of the fink paraview package
and updated it to the current 3.4.0 release. However I am having
trouble adding python support to my build. I want to build paraview
against the fink python26 package in %p (usually /sw). All may attempts
so far to set         

-DPARAVIEW_ENABLE_PYTHON:BOOL=ON \
-DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=%p/bin/python2.6 \
-DPYTHON_LIBRARIES=%p/lib/python2.6/config \
-DPYTHON_DEBUG_LIBRARIES=%p/lib/python2.6/config \
-DPYTHON_INCLUDE_PATH=%p/include/python2.6

or

-DPARAVIEW_ENABLE_PYTHON:BOOL=ON \
-DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=%p/bin/python2.6 \
-DPYTHON_LIBRARIES=%p/lib \
-DPYTHON_DEBUG_LIBRARIES=%p/lib \
-DPYTHON_INCLUDE_PATH=%p/include/python2.6

have failed. In the resulting build, configure finds the python
headers properly in %p/include/python2.6 but always finds the
wrong libraries. It returns the PythonLibs as...

/usr/lib/python2.6/config/libpython2.6.a

rather than the expected....

/sw/lib/python2.6/config/libpython2.6.a

Is there any easy way to fix this issue?

Gentlemen,

Thank you very much!

Merge Block -> Append Attributes

ended up being what I have been searching for.


thanks again,

I am not sure I understand. Is the solution to change all the vectors so
that their sign is positive before integrating the streamlines?

The persistent cache variables are singular.  The plural
names are those reported from FindPythonLibs for use by
the project, and they may contain additional libraries
(at least in the case of some other packages, so we
use this convention for naming).

It would help if you sent the screen shot.

Dear PV,
I am using paraview 3.4 executable downloaded from paraview site.  I have
debian lenny installed in my computer. When i try to save screenshot,
paraview crashes with following. Please let me know why is this happening.

Try this:
Go to Edit|Settings. Click on the "Render View" in the left pane and then
uncheck "Use offscreen for screenshots". Does that help?

Subject: [Paraview] Temperature visualisation
Message-ID: <1241810455.7621.0@udeclpt>

Hi all,

I have a hdf file containing 3 datasets. Each of dimension  
1x241x241. What I would like to do now is using the first two datasets 
to form a horizontal plane and assign the values of the third one as 
color values to each point. So lets say that values from the first two 
datasets (x,y) are (1,1), the third one which represents a temperature 
at this point is for example 0.5. Instead of using this as a height in 
the 3D visualisation (z will be constant), I want this point to be 
colored by its representive value.

Does anybody know how to do this? Or maybe there is a better solution 
to solve such a problem?

Guido

I would recommend writing an XDMF interface. XDMF is a text (XML)
format that you can use to describe the content of the hdf file. Once
you have the xdmf file paraview will be able to ingest your data.

This is what I have already done (see listing below).
It works to have a 3D representation. However I do not want the 
temperature as a height value but a color. z will be constant, for 
example 100.

I think you want GEOMETRY to be XY and make it refer to just the first
two data sets, then set up and ATTRIBUTE scalar to point to the third.

Hi David,

I think you have to put the temp array not to the geometry tag, but to  
an attribute tag.

I am not quite sure if the X_Y type exists, if not you could try to

<Xdmf>
   <Domain>
     <Grid GridType="Uniform">
       <Topology Type="Polyvertex" Dimensions="241 241 1"> </Topology>
       <Geometry Type="X_Y">
         <DataItem DataType="Float" Precision="4" Dimensions="1 241 241"
Format="HDF">
                 test.h5:/bands/latitude
         </DataItem>
         <DataItem DataType="Float" Precision="4" Dimensions="1 241 241"
Format="HDF">
            test.h5:/bands/longitude
         </DataItem>
       </Geometry>
       <Attribute AttributeType="Scalar" Center="Cell"  Name="Ttemp">
         <DataItem DataType="Float" Precision="4" Dimensions="1 241 241"
            Format="HDF">
                         test.h5:/bands/temp
         </DataItem>
        </Grid>
     </Domain>
</Xdmf>

or
<Xdmf>
   <Domain>

I am not quite sure if the X_Y type exists. Possibly you got to use  
one of the other Geometry options. Hope this will help you.

Cheers Johannes

OK, I did the following  (in this example I reduced the datasets) and 
it seems to work:

<Xdmf>
	<Domain>
		<Grid GridType="Uniform">
<Topology Type="Polyvertex" Dimensions="2 2 1"> </Topology>
<Geometry Type="X_Y_Z"> 
<DataItem DataType="Float" Precision="4" Dimensions="1 2 2" 
Format="HDF">
			test.h5:/bands/latitude
			</DataItem>
<DataItem DataType="Float" Precision="4" Dimensions="1 2 2" 
Format="HDF">
			test.h5:/bands/longitude
			</DataItem>
<DataItem DataType="Float" Precision="4" Dimensions="1 2 2" 
Format="HDF">
			test.h5:/bands/height
			</DataItem>
</Geometry>

<Attribute Type="Scalar" Name="Temp" Center="Cell">
<DataItem DataType="Float" Precision="4" Dimensions="4 1" Format="HDF">
			test.h5:/bands/temp
			</DataItem>
</Attribute>
		</Grid>
	</Domain>
</Xdmf>

But this means that I have to put the temperatures into a 4x1 dataset 
in this example. Or in the "real" case into a 58081x1 dataset. Copy/
paste will take a while.
Guess that this is a hdf related issue.

Thanks all!

figure out a way of creating multiple color gradients and legends on the
same image. In other words, I have an object that I use a contour filter for
that should have a different gradient than another object with a different
contour filter, but the moment I change the color gradient for one, the
other automatically changes. Is there a way to create two contour filters
with different color maps and legends?

Thanks,
Dae Il

Hi,
I am using vtkKdTree in a python programmable filter. I 
would like to use:
void vtkKdTree::FindPointsWithinRadius(double R,
   const double x[3],
   vtkIdList* result)

but I don't know how to write it in python. I tried the 
following :
coord = (687856,539156,269)
result = vtk.vtkIdList()
kdTree.FindPointsWithinRadius(100, coord, result)

but this doesn't work.

Thank you.

the method is not available. It is enclosed into a //BTX //ETX in the
source code of VTK/Filtering/vtkKdTree.h and does not get automatically
wrapped by Python.

End TCL Exclude.

VTK was originally wrapped for use with TCL -hence the name choice. The 
original parser code used BTX/ETX to mark pieces that couldn't be 
wrapped and should be skipped.

> ? how to know if a method is automaticlly or not ?

Look at the source code. You can usually guess which function are not 
likely to be wrapped. If they have pointers to structs etc they are 
usually not wrapped.

John,

The "Info" properties are information-only properties which are used to get
information about certain ivars from the server. These should never be set
by the client/python script. These are managed by ParaView server manager.

As far as specifying GUI size goes, you have set both GUISize and ViewSize;
GUISize is the size of the entire view including all views in a multiview
layout while view size is the size of each individual view. However it's not
recommended to use these properties through the python shell in the GUI.
(It's totally valid to use them in pvpython or pvbatch). Reason being the
GUI is free to change them whenever it feel like to ensure that layout is
correct.

You say there are issues with legend which depend on actual GUI size, which
is why you are not using the save image with resolution API. Can you attach
a screenshot with the issue you are referring to?

The axes indicators cannot be moved through python. You have to use "View
Settings" (Edit|View Settings) for that.

Berk,

Is this something that should be reported like this? Or was some work being
done that we just needed to wait until it was finished?

I think someone's cvs process died in the middle of a checkout/commit and
left the lock hanging. I had to manually delete the lock. Reporting it was
the right thing to do. Thanks.

Subject: [Paraview] multiple color legends on the same image
In-Reply-To: <4A07C4E5.8000504@cscs.ch>
Message-ID: <C62D89C0.BD22%kmorel@sandia.gov>

Some background information: ParaView makes the coloring for all variables of the same name consistent.  This is done to prevent misleading coloring when showing data from different parts in the pipeline or different data sets or different views.  If you want to break out of that behavior, you have to rename the field on one of the data sets.  John's suggestion is the easiest way to change the field name.

It's awful, but it works.

Use the calculator filter to copy one dataset to another. Change the name of the scalar array you are displaying. when you enable the colour legen for the new data, it will have a new name and so use a new colour lookup table. You can now display both independently.

Hi all,

I'm a bit of a newbie here, but I've been having some trouble trying to figure out a way of creating multiple color gradients and legends on the same image. In other words, I have an object that I use a contour filter for that should have a different gradient than another object with a different contour filter, but the moment I change the color gradient for one, the other automatically changes. Is there a way to create two contour filters with different color maps and legends?

Thanks,
Dae Il

Message-ID: <c19fcadc0905110929g4df1081ax38a1fb86a8b0c748@mail.gmail.com>

When I try to run pvpython on this computer, it segfaults trying to import
servermanager. If I try to open the python shell from inside paraview,
paraview crashes.

[doriad at dave experiment]$ pvpython
Python 2.6 (r26:66714, Mar 17 2009, 11:44:21)

>>> from paraview import servermanager
Segmentation fault

I'm using the CVS build of paraview, and I built it with python support.
Where can I start tracking down why this is happening?

Thanks,

Hi all,

Does anyone know how to set up Paraview's PVSERVER with Stereo enabled on a
Tiled Display? FYI... I don't need the usual GUI configuration paraview
--stereo because we are not running the client on our local cluster, is how
to make the PVSERVER use the stereo mode in order to correctly display on
the tiles.


Thank you

If I set the opacity of a file with around 50,000 cells to any value < 1, it
goes from working very smoothly to being super super choppy. Is this the

When objects with opacity < 1 are involved, ParaView uses depth-peeling to
ensure that the primitives are rendered in correct order. Depth peeling is a
multipass rendering technique which uses frame buffers etc. and hence is
slower than rendering without depth peeling at all. To verify that it's
depth peeling that's slowing things down, go to "Edit|settings" and in the
"Render View" options, uncheck Enable Depth Peeling.

Yea, that's much better. So what is the problem with leaving this off?
Sometimes things will look a bit wrong ie. something is in front of
something it shouldn't be?

Subject: [Paraview] Errors in console
Message-ID: <4A089A00.6010807@web.de>

Hello,

I'm having problems with the console. Everything I try to do in it 
causes an error. For example:

 >>> from paraview import servermanager
Traceback (most recent call last):
   File "<console>", line 1, in <module>
   File "C:\Program Files\ParaView 
3.4.0\lib\paraview-3.4\paraview\servermanager.py", line 43, in <module>
     import re, os, new, exceptions, sys, vtk
   File "C:\Program Files\ParaView 
3.4.0\lib\paraview-3.4\paraview\vtk.py", line 9, in <module>
     from vtkCommonPython import *
ImportError: DLL load failed: The specified procedure could not be found.

How can I fix this problem?

Thanks,

Subject: [Paraview] VTK-Python script or Paraview server manager script?
Message-ID: <4A08B492.2000002@web.de>

Hello,

Being a bit of a VTK/Paraview newbie, I'm having a little difficulty 
selecting the right tool for the job. I've got a number of polygonal 
primitives; lines, spheres, cylinders etc, in a 3d application and I 
would like to export and view these objects in Paraview. Because the 3d 
app is scriptable, I can write a plugin to export the primitives as VTK 
geometry data, but I shrink at the thought of handling low level 
operations that would be required. Therefore I'm considering another 
option namely: to have the 3d app write a VTK-Python or 
Paraview-Servermanager script based on the primitives in the scene. The 
problem now, is which scripting technique is better for the task, 
bearing in mind that what I would like to do is to view the primitives 
in Paraview.

Initially, I started out writing a Paraview-Servermanager script, but I 
later realized that a VTK-Python script might do the job as well, _if_ 
VTK-Python scripts can export programmatically created scene data.

Please advise.

Thanks.

Yup, but it's not merely a bit wrong since the order matters at the
primitive level and not merely the the object level. Just simply creating a
sphere source with opacity < 1 and interacting with it will highlight the
issue.

Thanks for the info, but I hope folks don't mind if I ask a few more
questions to clarify this procedure. I've never used calculator before and
it seems hard to find any tutorials on this particular topic. However, I'd
like to just clarify exactly what I'm trying to do so that I'm not asking
the wrong question.

I'm applying paraview to overlay a functional brain activation over a
template I've specified. The brain map has both positive and negative values
and when I apply a contour filter to this object, I can specify a range to
show only some of the positive values, compute its gradients and devise an
appropriate legend. When I create a new contour filter to show the negative
ranges with the hope of showing another color legend that reflects negative
activation, this is where I run into the problem of my first color legend
immediately changing to whatever I now specify. Having said all that, how
does one duplicate datasets in calculator with the ability to specify only
part of the range of values so that only the negative activations are shown?


Again thanks for the help and if there is a good tutorial one could
recommend to me so I could get some better grounding with this program, I
would be most grateful. Thanks!

Dae Il,
There are tutorials links found on the ParaView Wiki.  The wiki is found here: http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView, then see SNL ParaView 3 Tutorials.  All of the datasets are found in the ParaView data, found on the ParaView download page.

There is a brief description of how to use the calculator under Beginning Filters.

Use the calculator filter to copy one dataset to another. Change the name of the scalar array you are displaying. when you enable the colour legen for the new data, it will have a new name and so use a new colour lookup table. You can now display both independently.

Hi all,

I'm a bit of a newbie here, but I've been having some trouble trying to figure out a way of creating multiple color gradients and legends on the same image. In other words, I have an object that I use a contour filter for that should have a different gradient than another object with a different contour filter, but the moment I change the color gradient for one, the other automatically changes. Is there a way to create two contour filters with different color maps and legends?

Thanks,
Dae Il

John,

What are describing is not a bug at all. And even if you set the GUI size
explicitly before saving the image you will indeed get exactly the same
effect. Here's the reason: all 3D actors in the scene as positioned using 3D
world coordinates, however all 2D entities such as scalar bar, orientation
axes etc. are position using display coordinates. So whenever you change the
aspect ratio as dramatically as you are, you can expect considerable
placement changes with legends and such. For fun, setup the paraview gui and
then resize the paraview windows to mimic the aspect ratios you are using
and you shall see that the GUI behaves no differently.

Hi, are any analysis tools in ParaView for fitting distribution functions

Daniele,

Are you running the ParaView you compiled from scratch or the binary you downloaded?  It probably will not work to try to load the plugin into the distribured binary.

If you cannot load the plugin into the ParaView you compiled from scratch, try compiling both ParaView and the plugin with the CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE CMake variable set to Debug.

Dear Ken,

thanks very much for your help. I am on Mac OS X Leopard on Intel. I did not know how to add a new filter to Paraview, and here is what I have done

1) I have compiled Paraview from scratch
2) I have run ccmake and then make on the filter you gave me
3) I have now a libMergeTimeStepsSMPlugin.dylib

I open Paraview and try to load the new plugin via the plugin manager. I receive the error message "The file libMergeTimeStepsSMPlugin.dylib" is not a valid Qt plugin. I am using Qt 4.4

Do you know what should I do?

Best.

Another potential solution is to make a filter that loads all the timesteps from the upstream pipeline and merge their geometry together.  No such filter exists right now, but it would be straightforward to implement.

Wouldn't it be easier to treat z as t. So instead of multiple vtk
files, you could create one vtk file where the third axis represents
time. You could then use slice or extract subset filters to get the

but you would have to write a custom filter in C++ (Python would not
do).

The Prism plugin (found in the ParaView code repository and build by default) provides a phase space visualization tool.  Unfortunately, it is designed specifically for high energy density physics data from ALEGRA simulations, so I would be a bit surprised if you could use it without modification for your hybrid simulation results.

Subject: [Paraview] colorbar scaling with legacy VTK files
Message-ID: <1242148616.4601.3.camel@ohm.lan>

Hi there
  I have a problem with the 3.4 binary of paraview on an Ubuntu 9.04
installation. When I load a VTK file (legacy format) the range of the
colorbar runs only from 0 to 1 although in the info window of the file
the range of the dataset is given correctly. I simply do not understand
this behavior. I create the files with pyvtk a Python module to write
and read VTK files. 
When I read data from an EXODUSII file everything works fine.
Has anyone an idea whats I am doing wrong?

regards

Hey Eugen,

Have you tried opening any of the legacy VTK files from the ParaView  
Data (that you can download from their site: http://paraview.org/files/v3.4/ParaViewData3.4.zip 
  )?

I just tried the blow.vtk and RectGrid2.vtk and the scale bars look  
okay. (Ubuntu 8.10, though...)

Subject: [Paraview] Passing a python script parameters
Message-ID: <c19fcadc0905121158l36aed51ds68c74c3c0df5e614@mail.gmail.com>

In the python shell, there is a "Run Script" button. It seems that you can
only run scripts that do not require parameters? If I have a python function
in a .py file, how would I call it? In normal python, I would import the
function like this (the listdir was just to show you I was in the correct
directory):

 >>> os.listdir(".")

['IterateOpenSources.py', 'IterateOpenSources.py~', 'LoadMultipleFiles.py',
'LoadMultipleFiles.py~', 'Sphere.py']

>>> from LoadMultipleFiles import *

and here is the contnets of LoadMultipleFiles.py
--------------------------
#!/usr/bin/pvpython
def LoadMultipleFiles(FilePrefix, Low, High):
    #setup paraview connection
    from paraview import servermanager

    if not servermanager.ActiveConnection:
        connection = servermanager.Connect()

    pm = servermanager.ProxyManager()
    #actually do something here
---------------------------

You can see the function requires a couple of parameters - how can I pass
them?

Thanks,

David

Paraview will load them as A_*, and put one in each time step. Is there a

Load each one in turn, then select all four in the pipeline browser
and apply the append or group filter.

Just to come to closure on this, in my testing against our data based on 
this email exchange, CleanToGrid is not necessary. Running through the 
D3 filter seems to be sufficient for cleaning up the boundary layers in 
the Exodus dataset.

Thanks to all who contributed.

Sure that would work, but I forgot to put a "..." after the 4 files haha. If
there are 2000, then I cannot load them all manually. I have used the
vtkAppendPolyData filter to combine files, but it seems like something you
should not have to break out c++ to do.

Ok, I accept that - it was simply the appearance that the axes 
indicators only altered in size with vertical scaling (but not with the 
horizontal scaling) that I thought might be a bug. Hadn't actually 
noticed this though until I created the examples - was not the central 
tenet of the issue I was raising

This is the issue exactly "then resize the paraview windows to mimic the 
aspect ratios you are using" - How do I do that for a specified 
resolution ?
I think we have come back full circle to the issue I was raising. And 
that is how do I set the GUI/View/Image window to a specified resolution 
? At the moment the only way I can see is run a script, after altering 
the size of the window with the mouse, to see what the current size is 
and then repeating the process until the desired resolution is obtained 
- a little bit iterative and clumsy.

Clearly from your description a scene is composed of different forms of 
actors (2D & 3D) and that these behave differently when scaled in the 
"save screenshot" command. Therefore in order to achieve repeatability I 
need to be able to set my View/scene/image window to my desired size 
each time I load paraview so that I am seeing a true representation of 
what I am creating and thus avoiding any scaling at the "save 
screenshot" stage.

Ideally I'd like the ability to specify the scene/image window size 
directly or failing that to see its size in real time as I drag the 
borders with the mouse to my desired size.

Thanks

John

I have no idea what the problem is.  If you use the "Run Script" button to run the LoadMultipleFiles.py file, it creates a LoadMultipleFiles() function just like if you used the "from X import Y" command (which, incidentally, should also work assuming your python path is correct).  I just tried it and it works fine.

You can see the function requires a couple of parameters - how can I pass them?

I think your best bet is to create a .pvtp file that points to all of your .vtp files.  This file format and its brethren are documented in the "VTK File Formats" chapter of The VTK User's Guide."

My suggestion was just approximately resize with the mouse to demonstrate
what was happening with 2D actors. There's no easy way (besides modifying
the code) to change the size of the window/view when using ParaView Qt
client. It's a different story when using pvbatch or pvpython.

Feel free to add a feature request to the bug tracker.

I see, I didn't realize you could not import files that are not on the
python path (I assumed it would also look in the current directory). You are
also correct that when you "Run script" on a .py file that defines a
function, the function gets defined and can be used normally.

Thanks for the clarification.

I wrote a python script to load files with sequential names:
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Python_Scripting#Load_many_sequentially_named_files

The visibility property of the representation doesn't seem to actual make
the representation visible... anyone see what is wrong with how I am setting
the visibility?

Message-ID: <47281.10.1.4.70.1242225232.squirrel@mailsrv2.vki.ac.be>

Hello ParaView users,

 I'd like to ask what is the status of implementation of high order
elements in ParaView. I have a mesh file with P2 triangles (VTK element
type 22), which works fine for me. However, I'd like to ask if it is
possible to display also P3 (or possibly even higher order elements) in
ParaView in a 'natural way', i.e. without having to break the HO element
into subelements.
  In fact, I'd also like to know if it is possible to display high order
elements without seeing their subelements. After I load my P2 mesh, I
don't see the mesh as such, but its subtriangulation and I don't like it
too much.
 The pdf file which describes legacy and new vtk file format doesn't
mention more than second order elements, but I've also found some reports
on HO element visualization using the VTK toolkit written by Sandia
researchers. Therefore I thought that maybe things will change with the
upcoming ParaView 3.6.
 Thank you for any information on this topic.

You can use "make VERBOSE=1" to see the full compile commands for a single
time.  There is also a an option in cmake to have it do it every time but I
don't know that off the top of my head.

Another possibility is that it may be another library that needs to be
compiled with -fPIC.

Subject: [Paraview] VTK-Python script or Paraview server manager script?

A VTK Python script would do the job fine. You have to import vtk, create
one or more vtkPolydata and then write them out using a writer. There are a
few formats to choose from. I would use vtkPolyDataWriter to write a VTK
file.

Can you give us some more information?
* Are you using the Windows binary from the ParaView site? 32 bit or 64 bit?
* Do you have multiple installations of ParaView or maybe VTK? Do you have
PYTHONPATH set?

Not unless you unselect the array and Apply (which would cause re-execution
of  everything downstream).

this message is telling you that libpgc was compiled as a static library 
and was not compiled with the -fPIC flag. Unfortunately, you can't link 
a non relocatable static lib into a (relocatable) dynamic/shared lib - 
so you must either find a libpgc.so and replace the link options with 
this lib instead of libpgc.a - or you must recompile libpgc with the 
-fPIC flag - which may not be an option - either way, you must find 
another libpgc which you can link - oitherwise you're limited to 
building static and hence no plugins for paraview.

Does anyone know if it's possible to rescale the color bar considering all
values of a transient dataset? I just need to get the maximum and minimum
values across all time steps.

thanks for any help.

Ok, I've just found a way using the "Temporal Statistics" filter to get the
maximum and minimum values. After that we just need to fix the color bar
range using these values.

Just to keep the question:

Is there any simpler or automatic way to do that?

Cheers

I would be interested in a simple way  to do this too.  It seems like  
a potentially expensive choice since it requires loading every time  
step, but it would be worth having it as a simple option.

This issue has come up quite a bit.  We are trying to think of a way to set the range reasonably while avoiding expensive loading and maintaining consistent behavior.  One idea we are considering is to set the range based on the last time step, which often has a range close to the full range.

Hi Pete,

I tried to forward my CMakeCache for a  64 bit CentOS machine, but it  
got blocked. I built a 64 bit version using openmpi built on gcc. I  
think I installed openmpi with yum, which puts it in /usr/lib64/ 
openmpi/1.2.7-gcc/bin/mpicc.  Also, if you're using Qt  4.5.1 you also  
had to download and install a new version of the fontconfig library  
and build 64 bit shared  libraries for it.

I wonder know what's the magic behind Ensight. It loads the transient data
range almost instantaneously. We just set a variable to paint the model and
the color bar appears with a reasonable range for the transient data.

Ken, setting the range by the last time step is a bit dangerous isn't it?
For example, in my case, I'm coloring a dam break fluid flow model by the
velocity magnitude. In this problem we stop the simulation after the fluid
rests in a static position. Therefore the last time step velocity should be
almost zero.

Renato.

I am told that EnSight find the range by loading the range from the last time step, which is where we got the idea.  It might be more to it than that.  Perhaps if the file format stores ranges over times it will load that and you data follows that?

Ken, setting the range by the last time step is a bit dangerous isn't it? For example, in my case, I'm coloring a dam break fluid flow model by the velocity magnitude. In this problem we stop the simulation after the fluid rests in a static position. Therefore the last time step velocity should be almost zero.

What about interpolating the ranges in a regular number of time steps? For
instance, let's say we have a dataset with 100 time steps. Instead of
loading all files to find the correct range, we could have an estimative by
computing the maximum and minimum values using only 20 or 50 time steps.
Maybe the user could choose how many time steps should be skipped.

more two cents :oP

I would be in favor of either taking the last time step, or preferably using all of them.  If you take a subset of any chaotic event, you will miss spikes.

Dear Ken,

I have recompiled Paraview with the Debug flag specified (the same for the
plugin), and I am sure I am launching the appropriate Paraview compilation.
I obtain the following error:

QLibrary::loady_sys:Cannot load libMergeTimeStepsSMPlugin

During compilation, I receive a Warning about the fact that I am using Qt
4.4

Best.

Hmmm.  The most likely culprit would be that the loader cannot find all the dependent libraries for the plugin.  What does otool -L report are the dependent libraries for the plugin.  (Make sure you are using the same environment ParaView is run in.)

Dear Ken,

I have recompiled Paraview with the Debug flag specified (the same for the plugin), and I am sure I am launching the appropriate Paraview compilation. I obtain the following error:

QLibrary::loady_sys:Cannot load libMergeTimeStepsSMPlugin

During compilation, I receive a Warning about the fact that I am using Qt 4.4

Best.

Daniele,

Are you running the ParaView you compiled from scratch or the binary you downloaded?  It probably will not work to try to load the plugin into the distribured binary.

If you cannot load the plugin into the ParaView you compiled from scratch, try compiling both ParaView and the plugin with the CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE CMake variable set to Debug.

Dear Ken,

thanks very much for your help. I am on Mac OS X Leopard on Intel. I did not know how to add a new filter to Paraview, and here is what I have done

1) I have compiled Paraview from scratch
2) I have run ccmake and then make on the filter you gave me
3) I have now a libMergeTimeStepsSMPlugin.dylib

I open Paraview and try to load the new plugin via the plugin manager. I receive the error message "The file libMergeTimeStepsSMPlugin.dylib" is not a valid Qt plugin. I am using Qt 4.4

Do you know what should I do?

Best.

I also implemented a very simple filter to merge the time steps like you want.  The source, complete with plugin, is attached to this message.  The attachment may or may not make it to the paraview users' list.

Another potential solution is to make a filter that loads all the timesteps from the upstream pipeline and merge their geometry together.  No such filter exists right now, but it would be straightforward to implement.

Wouldn't it be easier to treat z as t. So instead of multiple vtk
files, you could create one vtk file where the third axis represents
time. You could then use slice or extract subset filters to get the
plane that you want. You can do something similar for a file series
but you would have to write a custom filter in C++ (Python would not
do).

Hi,

I have Paraview installed on a linux cluster, but the volume rendering
does not seem to work with Server/Client mode. It leaves an "Outline"
box on the screen with nothing else. Other functions work fine and
volume rendering works fine on a single-processor. Any guesses as to
why. Thanks.

Make sure that you are doing remote rendering. Go to Edit|Settings. The on
the Render View | Server sub option, ensure that "Remote Render Threshold"
is checked and move the slide to the left i.e. 0.

Also, volume rendering has been greatly improved in the ParaView trunk which will be released as ParaView 3.6 RSN (Real Soon Now).  ParaView 3.4.0 had some pretty bad volume rendering issues.

Hi Huina,

Have you tried running the merge blocks filter and selecting volume  
visualization on that?

Dear Dr. Liu,

I tried to install development version paraview3.5.0, but it also gave me
the same error message:

ERROR: In /home/srana2/opt/ParaView3/VTK/IO/vtkEnSightGoldBinaryReader.cxx,
line 3977
vtkEnSightGoldBinaryReader (0x1c35400): Read failed

Could you please throw some more light on how to visualize particle data.
What my understanding says is, glyph adds sphere at every node point and
scales them with the data in particle file for example diameter of particles
in *.DP file when we select the scale mode as scalar. Though I am not sure
how particle coordinate file comes in to the picture.
I don't have more than 5000 particles in my simulation but information tab
shows as ~169750 number of points. Also the development version doesn't
shows the option to color the particles with particle data.
Thanks for your time.

Regards,
Sandeep

P.S : Attached is the new particle image file  for reference

I mean there has been much difference between ParaView3.4 (that you are
using) and the latest version regarding EnSight Gold files.

Hi Pete,

If you can't find pgc libraries that are buiilt with PIC you might try  
the openmpi compilers built on gcc. I'm attaching my CMakeCache.txt  
from a CentOS 5 machine.

Dear Paraviewers !
 
Right now I'm using Paraview on SGI Prism ia64 it works on my powerwall with stereo without any problems (exept I 'm causing it).
We are getting a new computer SGI Virtu by end of june with sled 10 SP2 Linux 64 Bit.
is it possible :-) to run paraview 3.x on this machine. I have 3 displays 0.1 0.2 0.3 as one screen displaying stereo.
Or any problems to expect.

Subject: [Paraview] Secrets of the ParaView install process
Message-ID: <4A111816.7030900@cscs.ch>

I tried to create an install package of (tweaked) paraview + plugins on 
windows.

All runs fine except that
1) Python dlls (etc) are not included in the distribution
2) QtAssistant won't run - so help is unavailable.

Are there special tricks required to make paraview include the necessary 
python dll's (and init scripts?) - I'm using python 2.6. I notice that 
the paraview 3.4 release on the kitware website uses python 2.5. Should 
I revert to 2.5 to solve the problem. Are things 'hard coded' for 2.5 
that don't work for 2.6.
If I use the zip installer, I can manually add python libs to the 
distribution, if I uses the NSIS installer I cannot. The ParaView3.4 
release uses NSIS - so was some secret process involved in adding these 
files?

For QtAssistant, I don't know why it won't run. any clues welcome (path?)

NB. I have not set any
PATH,
PV_PLUGIN_PATH,
PYTHON_XXX_???

Variables. should I setup a batch file which initializes these and then 
calls paraview (plugins load fine if they are in the plugins directory)

Many thanks

JB

After some experimentation, python now works (astonished surprise) - the 
main trick appear to be to cpoy the python lib dir structure into the 
correct relative place in the install tree.

qt-assistant still does not work. The assisstant help issue appears to 
be caused by paraview invoking the wrong command line, but I don't 
understand why.

Also...I forgot to ask first time around.
why are the iceT DLLs installed into lib when all other dlls are 
installed into the bin directory. (Is this a simple mistake, or is ther 
a real reason?)

Without digging deeper into the Qt Assistant problem I know that there  
was a slight name change from Qt 4.3 to Qt 4.4 for the QtAssistant. I  
think it is called "Assistant_adp" now. So check your Qt version and  
see if that might be the problem.

The secret is to edit the file
pqClientDocFinder.txt
to change the hard coded path to the assistant. I replaced it with
.\bin\assistant
.\bin\pqClient.adp
because the launch bat file starts in the dir below .\bin

Seems strange that one needs to
a) Create an installer
b) Install it locally
c) change the IceT libs, edit the pqClientDocFinder.txt, copy the python 
libs, copy a few plugin binaries
[d) edit the manifest file to get around the VisualStudio 2008 SP1 problem]
e) re-zip the whole lot back up again

e) upload zip file for users to download

steps b/c/e seem unnecessary, but the final package works - so I can't 
grumble. Users have a customized paraview with added plugins auto-loaded 
etc and all are happy.

NB. I placed the attached batch file for launching in the root install 
dir so that I can override paths on my main machine with the installer 
ones and the development ones in my hardcoded PV_PLUGIN_PATYH are not 
picked up as the batch file overwrites the locations etc

regards and sorry for the noise

JB
PS. the manifest editing is actually pointless if you are includsing 
python, because even if you do it right, the python dll is compiled 
against the old pre SP1 redist so it still fails, you are better off 
telling users to install the vcredist package first.

Hi,

I am trying to import some data in Ensight case format into ParaView.
Among others (e.g. "vector per node"), my data contains "scalar per
element data". The files are ASCII-files.
Opening the case file in Paraview does not result in any error and
the cell data appears with the other data members in the Properties
tab of the Object Inspector. However, in the Information tab, the
element data does not appear (but e.g. the "vector per node" and also
"scalar per node" data apppears) and I can also not color using the
"scalar per element" data.
I tried it both with the "ensight"-format files as well as with
"ensight gold" format files. Also, I tested it with Paraview 3.4.0
(under both Ubuntu and Windows) and the development version 3.5.0
under Ubuntu. For the ensight format, you can find pieces from my
files below.

I would appreciate any help on this.
Thanks in advance and best regards,

Peter

whatever necessary files used for re-producing the problem. Then I will look

Subject: [Paraview] Fullscreen mode?
In-Reply-To: <4A10E7D3.2000202@web.de>
Message-ID: <C637035E.9420%kmorel@sandia.gov>

No, not really.  The closest thing is to run ParaView in client/server mode and set the server up to be a tiled display with one tile (-tdx=1 -tdy=1).  In this case the server will create a full screen window and display your visualization there.  This is not convenient, however, as you must have two computers to run in this mode, one for GUI controls and one for display.

Another option that is not really what you asked for but fairly close is to maximize the ParaView window and then remove the Widgets from the GUI.  Close the Pipeline Browser, Object Inspector, and and other dockable windows you have up.  You can also hide any and all toolbars.

Don't worry.  ParaView comes with a money back guarantee ;-)

In seriousness, I can't think of any particular problem that you would encounter with compiling ParaView to this platform.

I'm not sure if you want to use the computer to drive the 3 displays as a tiled display or if you plan to just launch the ParaView GUI and let the windowing system handle the display management.  Either way should work, I think.  You can use a pvserver to drive the 3 displays as a tiled display by running as an MPI job and giving each node a different -display flag.  However, I don't think stereo works on tiled displays.  I have heard one or two reports of people getting it to work and some patches were being passed on this mailing list at some point, but I don't think anyone has taken the expense to productionize that work.

Dear Paraviewers !

Right now I'm using Paraview on SGI Prism ia64 it works on my powerwall with stereo without any problems (exept I 'm causing it).
We are getting a new computer SGI Virtu by end of june with sled 10 SP2 Linux 64 Bit.
is it possible :-) to run paraview 3.x on this machine. I have 3 displays 0.1 0.2 0.3 as one screen displaying stereo.
Or any problems to expect.

Hi John,

Which version of Qt/ParaView are you using? It is very possible that
it has been broken since 3.4. I think some changes were made to
accommodate for Qt 4.4 assistant change but I am not sure if it was
tested yet.

I don't know why it don't understand a attribut "Normals" on paraview 3.5

There my script belong, if someone can help me to understand where is my bug.

I am new to paraview, but I think it's a bug in Paraview 3.5. What do you think?

Is the clip filter's output just obscured by the original sphere?
To check, remove these two lines from your script.

The error you are seeing with version 3.5 is due to the fact that you
loaded the python modules using the old syntax:

from paraview import servermanager

try changing it by typing:

from paraview.simple import *

and your error disappears.

Hello all,

I'm working with paraview and a tiled display. We have configured the tiled
display visualization using -tdx and -tdy without problems, but we are
wondering how to configure our tiled display with stereo support. We have
read that you change some lines in the ParaView code in order to support
stereo, and then run paraview with the --stereo option, but we have not
found such an option in pvserver. Is there any way to configure the pvserver
with tiled display and stereo support? Thanks a lot in advance for your
help.

  In this links you (and everyone else) can find the program ens_checker

It checks for binary and ASCII files. ens_checker.32 is for 32 bit

  hope it can be of use.

  just do ./ens_checker.<32/64> filename.case

Hi Ricardo:

    Thank you so much. This will help figure out quickly whether a problem
is simply due to the invalidity of the file format or a real bug with
ParaView's EnSight Reader.

Subject: [Paraview] Post processing vts data in paraview with python
Message-ID: <2bd34dd10905191952t6d2634bfue2c85fafa2d5b5e2@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I'm new to using Python with Paraview.  I've been generating data in
the vts file format, and I would like to do some post processing on it
inside Paraview.

I'm trying to read data from a structured grid and just get the
various values for different X, Y, and Z positions.

I have a simple script that looks like:

from paraview.servermanager import *
Connect()

reader = sources.XMLStructuredGridReader(FileName="fields.vts")
extract=filters.ExtractGrid(Input=reader)

So far this seems to work, I've been trying to figure out what methods
exist withing ExtractGrid and XMLStructuredGridReader that I can use
to find out what values I have at certain positions.

Does anyone have a script that already does something similar?

Thanks,

Mark

	3.5
Message-ID: <C8D3F57E07352C4B9C8E779E2B27B9EA0EA0C4@LAXA.intra.cea.fr>


Hi all,

I am new to paraview, I am using Linux and Paraview 3.4 or/and 3.5. I have 4 questions (with two themes) when I would like reading a file VTK.

- I have made a sphere (surface) with Paraview and saved in a file .VTK 
With python and paraview 3.4, I can read and see the file.
	from paraview.servermanager import *
	connection = servermanager.Connect('localhost')
	reader = servermanager.sources.LegacyVTKFileReader(FileNames='sphere.vtk')
	view = servermanager.CreateRenderView()
	rep = servermanager.CreateRepresentation(reader, view)
	view.ResetCamera()
	view.StillRender()

With paraview 3.5, I can read but not see.
	I have changed "from paraview.servermanager import *" by "from paraview.simple import *"
	and "servermanager.sources.LegacyVTKFileReader" by "servermanager.sources.LegacyVTKreader"


- I have made a wavelet (volume) with Paraview and saved in a file .VTK 
With python and paraview 3.4, I can read and can't see.
I have tried to add "rep.Representation = 4" to see with the volume, but I have a error "Cell scalars not supported, Segmentation error" when I excute the line with "view.StillRender()"

With python and paraview 3.5, I had already a error "Segmentation error" when I read the file. And I don't know how I must do to have the representation with volume.


I have done with a file simple to do the examples because I'll have another file VTK to read like that.
Thanks in advance for your kind help.

Regards, 
Jona

In the python shell you can run dir(filters.ExtractGrid) and
dir(sources.XMLStructuredGridReader) to see which methods are supported in
python.

Berk,

Looking at readers.xml I see that the STL reader is overriding the STL reader because it has the wrong label.  Could you fix this please (and make sure it gets to the 3.6 branch)?

Also, the capitalization of the readers is weird.  It is LegacyVTKreader, but shouldn't it be LegacyVTKReader?  It seem wrong not to have "reader" capitalized don't you think?  This naming is pervasive on many readers.

Thanks David.  I've done dir and help on sources, filters, and many of
the member functions/variables.

I did find that sources.XMLStructuredGridReader has a
GetDataInformation() member, and inside of that a DataInformation
variable that has a number of members that indicate that it has loaded
my data, but I'm still unable to find any member functions that can
retrieve the values of my data at particular grid points.

Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks,

Mark

Sorry Mark, I can't figure it out either (I tried with XMLPolydatareader
too). There seems to be a PointData member, but as you say I don't know how
to get at the actual data. I guess we'll wait for one of the experts to
reply :)

Thanks,

Subject: [Paraview] Tiled Display Stereo Visualization

Hi Simon,
Yeah, there is documentation on ParaView running on tiled display mode. You
can read old posts in the mailing list regarding the topic or read the
instructions in this site (https://visualization.hpc.mil/wiki/*Paraview*_*
Tiled*-*Display*_Mode). It seems like the site is currently off line, but
you can still read it on Google's cache.

We use a rendering cluster where each node gets one of the tiles, so we are
using distributed rendering. Basically, what you do for setting up the tiled
display mode is running pvserver in parallel mode (using MPI, you have to
compile ParaView from source in order to enable MPI support) in the
following way:

mpirun -np XX --hostfile PATH_TO_HOSTFILE /bin/env DISPLAY=:0 pvserver
--server-port=PORT -tdx=xTiles -tdy=yTiles

where XX is the number of processors that you are going to use to run
pvserver, PORT is the port number you want to use to bind the server, xTiles
is the number of screens you are going to use in the X dimension, and yTiles
is the number of screens you are going to use in the Y dimension. For
example, for a 3 * 2 tile screen you will use -tdx=3 and -tdy=2

You have to remember two things when you are configuring such a setup.
First, you have to configure the xhost in each participant computer to
receive incoming connections from the other computers in the visualization
cluster, otherwise the setup will not show anything. Second, you have to
configure a hostfile where each node gets one screen in the correct order.
For example, for the previous configuration I would use something like this:

192.168.85.6 slots=1
192.168.85.4 slots=1
192.168.85.2 slots=1
192.168.85.5 slots=1
192.168.85.3 slots=1
192.168.85.1 slots=1

That would be the hosts file. It is organized in such a way that the first
computer (192.168.85.6) gets the upper left display, while the last computer
gets the bottom right display. It is better explained in the previous link,
so please have a look at that site.

In the other hand, I don't know if pvserver supports stereo. How is your
stereo visualization setup? Did you connect to a server or did you use the
paraview client directly without connecting to a server?

Thanks a lot for your help.

Subject: [Paraview] [paraview] Question about pqView
Message-ID: <d44cc9190905201628t6154cf1nbc56339535df92c0@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,
I'm developing a ParaView plugin that modifies the camera position with data
coming from a interaction device. I'm using C++ and Linux 64 bit. I have
tested it with the build in server and it works without a hitch. However,
when I connect the client to a server used for visualizing data in a tiled
display, I run on some issues, namely a Segmentation Fault :(.

When I connect my client to the remote server, I load my plugin and connect
it to the server used for reading the data from the interaction device. It
works well if I use a build-in source for test (like a cylinder), and
nothing wrong happen. However, If I try to load a ParaView state of a more
complex model, the client collapses (Almost every time, sometimes it works
just fine and I can use the interaction device with the tile display). When
I run gdb, It says that the segmentation fault is triggered by a call to
vtkCamera::Roll or some other method of vtkCamera. Since I'm doing this at
the constructor of my plugin:

  pqView * theView = pqActiveView::instance().current();
  vtkSMRenderViewProxy* myProxy =
(vtkSMRenderViewProxy*)theView->getViewProxy();
 *theCamera = myProxy->GetActiveCamera();

and theCamera is a member of my plugin class, I thought that maybe the
pqView is changing when I load the state, and the vtkCamera address is no
longer valid. Obviously, I would get a Segmentation Fault.

Since It seems like pqView changes when I load a state, then I changed my
code in order to obtain the new pqView each time my method that changes the
camera position is called (It is a SLOT, by the way). So I changed it like
this:

void myClass::changeCameraPosition(const float  roll, const float elevation,
const float  azimuth)
{
  pqView * theView = pqActiveView::instance().current();
  vtkSMRenderViewProxy* myProxy =
(vtkSMRenderViewProxy*)theView->getViewProxy();
  vtkCamera *newCamera = myProxy->GetActiveCamera();
  cout << "AddNewCam "<<newCamera<<" endNC"<<endl;
  newCamera->Roll(roll);
  newCamera->Elevation(elevation);
  newCamera->Azimuth(azimuth);
  newCamera->OrthogonalizeViewUp();
}

As you can see, I have added a cout in order to show the new address of
theCamera. However, when I tried this solution, the client would die even
before printing the new camera address.

So, I wanted to ask you, What I'm doing wrong? Is there something different
with pqView in a local setting opposed to a remote setting? And, more
importantly, why it works sometimes? I would expect a bad behaving code to
break every single time, not working in isolated occasions.

Thanks a lot in advance for your help.

Message-ID: <1c02becc0905202306g52442022mb315491c4fce9d3a@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

   I am trying to cmake the latest CVS version of Paraview using vc2005 on
64 bit vista. I got the following errors:

CMake Error at Utilities/Xdmf2/libsrc/CMakeLists.txt:429 (INSTALL):

install Library TARGETS given no DESTINATION!


  I found this problem also occurs on the dashbourd:
dash1vista32.kitware<http://www.cdash.org/CDash/viewSite.php?siteid=20&project=9&currenttime=1242865800>

  http://www.cdash.org/CDash/viewConfigure.php?buildid=337104


  I am wondering if you can help.


Thanks,

Mengda

Andres,

The active pqView can always change -- as you discovered when state file is
loaded or new views are created or client disconnects/reconnects to a server
etc. So it makes sense to get the active view fresh each time. Also note
that the active view can be NULL as well or some other type that the render
view. So a save method would be:

pqView * theView = pqActiveView::instance().current();
vtkSMRenderViewProxy* myProxy = theView?
  vtkSMRenderViewProxy::SafeDownCast(theView->getViewProxy()) : NULL;
if (!myProxy)
  {
  // no active view, or active view is not a render view.
  return;
  }

Hopefully that helps.

You can use servermanager.Fetch() to fetch the raw data set to the client,
however it only works for unstructured datasets.

I'd suggest sticking with Qt 4.3.X until we move to 4.5. I have
noticed other small glitches with 4.4 on my Mac. I am not sure if
that's the case with other OSes.

I started updating http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Python_Scripting
to reflect the changes to the Python API coming in 3.6. We hope that
this will make it much easier for everyone to use ParaView from
Python. We are also working on the ability to save trace and state as

  The orientation of the cylinder glyph is normal to the vector used. Is 
this intended and is there a any possibility of the axis of the cylinder

These issues should be fixed. I made a pass over the XML labels (which
are now used by the simple and servermanager modules). I will send out
a separate e-mail on the Python changes in 3.5 and 3.6.

Message-ID: <4A19A569.24098.436CB@pte.nexgo.de>

Hello Ricardo, hello Samuel,

thanks for the ens_checkers!
Unfortunately, I could not get the one for linux to work, because of 
a libstdc++.so.5 missing. The windows version gives indeed an error 
for my ensight case file (see below), which I do not fully understand 
however. Ens_checker is expecting 1395 entries in the variable file 
example0002.temp. However, from the geometry file example0002.geo it 
should expect 1719. Shouldn't it?
BTW, the checker gives the same error for my case file when I use 
"per node" data and these are read in fine in Paraview?

Anything else that I might have wrong in my case files?

Thanks and best regards,

Peter

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView Python users please read
Message-ID: <45d654b0905241724w31675c7fi998c9a68c60a5175@mail.gmail.com>

Hi folks,

As some of you may know, we are working hard on cleaning up and
improving the Python support in ParaView. Towards this goal, I made
many significant changes to ParaView's Python modules. You should take
a look at http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Python_Scripting to see
what the new scripts should now look like. Also, your old scripts that
use the servermanager module will break in 3.6. Until you upgrade your
scripts, you can use the backward compatibility mode. To enable
compatibility with 3.4, you should do the following

import paraview
paraview.compatibility.major = 3
paraview.compatibility.minor = 4

from paraview import servermanager

Make sure to set the compatibility before importing servermanager. If
you run into compatibility issues, please let us know. Also, please
report any bugs and missing features that you encounter (and things
that you don't like).

Best,
-berk

Subject: [Paraview] xyz or zyx in XDMF-files?
Message-ID: <4A1A5CD9.9050202@gmx.de>

Hello Paraview-Experts,

I am using XDMF-file-format to display flow-simulation results.
I just figured out, that XDMF is somehow mixing the dimensions :(

If I store a 3d-dataset using hdf5 in xyz-style. I have to access these
dataset using xdmf in zyx-style.

This is some kind of strange. Is there any reason for that behavior?

Hi!
I?m trying to use the vtkDataSetObjectToDataSetFilter, but it doesn?t really work, this is my code:

  vtkSmartPointer<vtkDataObject> inputCopy;
  inputCopy.TakeReference(input->NewInstance());
  inputCopy->ShallowCopy(input);

  vtkDataObjectToDataSetFilter* DoToDS = vtkDataObjectToDataSetFilter::New();
  DoToDS -> SetInput(inputCopy);
  vtkDataSet* ds = DoToDS -> GetOutput();
 
  DoToDS -> Update();

Compiling is ok, executing I get the following error:

ERROR: In .../ParaView-3.4.0/VTK/Graphics/vtkDataObjectToDataSetFilter.cxx, line 291
vtkDataObjectToDataSetFilter (0x1377fd00): Couldn't create any points


ERROR: In ../ParaView-3.4.0/VTK/Graphics/vtkDataObjectToDataSetFilter.cxx, line 560

It seems I need to specify more, but what? and how?

thx for help,

Hi all,

I am new to paraview, I am using Linux. I read a lot of paraview emails this morning. I see you have been work hard last days on python script.
I download last version and compile.
Now I can read a file VTK surface sphere. But, I have still one error when I want to show my volume VTK file. I read a file then I tried to change the representation and I execute Render(), I have a problem : Cell Scalars not supported.

I link my VTK file in my email.
Thanks in advance for your kind help.

Look at:
http://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkDataObjectToDataSetFilter.html

The documentation describes the API for specifying which arrays to use for
points/cells etc.

Jona,

Look at the attached script.
For volume rendering you need to specify the scalar to use for volume
rendering as well as the color lookup table as well as the scalar opacity
function. The attached script illustrates how to do the same.

Message-ID: <c19fcadc0905251113n36f83b77r2a57de842a5528bb@mail.gmail.com>

Often I will have a vtp file with X points, X vertices, and Y triangles. In
the "information", it just says (X+Y) cells. Is it possible to have it
display more specific information about how many of each type of cell (verts
vs polys in this case) there are?

Also, can you turn off the display of vertices? I usually just turn the
point size down to 1, but they are still visible at the corners of the
triangles. I like to keep the verts in the file though because then I can
just switch from "surface" to "points" representation to see the vertices,
without having to glyph the points.

Thanks,

David

Subject: [Paraview] Scripting the animation of a slice
Message-ID: <919e0fb50905260128n221db06alc14e18ab71bddba6@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am a new ParaView user, and although there are some quirks, I like it so far.

I am now writing a script to write out an animation. One part of the
animation involves animating a slice filter moving in the z-direction.
When I create the animation using the GUI, in the "Animation View"
window I add a track for "Slice1" and select the "Slice Type - Origin
(2)" property. This works fine. I am unable to find out, however, what
the property name is for the slice object when creating the animation
in Python.

Another property I would like to animate is opacity of the data.
Again, using the GUI this works fine, but I can't figure out how to do
this in a script.

Neither calling ListProperties() on the object or dir() gets me any
further. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

I run my script from the ParaView 3.4.0 built-in Python shell. The
data is in Legacy VTK format. This is the script I have so far:

#!/usr/bin/python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

#################################################
# parameters
filename = "test.avi"
fps = 12.0 # frames/seconds

#################################################
# preparation
view = servermanager.GetRenderView()
camera = view.GetActiveCamera()

movie = servermanager.animation.AnimationScene()
movie.ViewModules = [view]
movie.NumberOfFrames = fps * totaltime

pm = servermanager.ProxyManager()

#################################################
# cue 1: animating horizontal slices
data = pm.GetProxy("sources", "data.vtk")
bounds = data.GetDataInformation().DataInformation.GetBounds()
startZ = bounds[5]
endZ = bounds[4]

cut = pm.GetProxy("sources", "Slice1")

cue1 = servermanager.animation.KeyFrameAnimationCue()
cue1.AnimatedProxy = cut

# What is the name of the property to change the z- position of the slice?
cue1.AnimatedPropertyName = "InputBounds" # <---------This does not work!!!

# two key frames with ramp interpolation
keyf0 = servermanager.animation.CompositeKeyFrame()
keyf0.Type = 2 # Set keyframe interpolation type to Ramp.
keyf0.KeyTime = 0
keyf0.KeyValues= [startZ]

keyf1 = servermanager.animation.CompositeKeyFrame()
keyf1.KeyTime = 1.0
keyf1.KeyValues= [endZ]

cue1.KeyFrames = [keyf0, keyf1]

movie.AddCueProxy(cue1)

#################################################
# Play the animation
#movie.Play()

#################################################
# Save the animation as an AVI movie
movieWriter = servermanager.vtkSMAnimationSceneImageWriter()
movieWriter.SetFrameRate(fps)
movieWriter.SetFileName(filename)
movieWriter.SetAnimationScene(movie.SMProxy)
movieWriter.Save()

The plane use for slicing is an another proxy accessible as:

cut.CutFunction[0]

cut.CutFunction[0].ListProperties() should show you the available properties
(one of them is the Origin).

Likewise, opacity if a property on the representation for the source in the
view. The following code will help you locate the representation for the
slice filter.

view = servermanager.GetRenderView()
cut_repr = None
for rep in view.Representations:
  if rep.Input[0].Proxy == cut:
    cut_repr = rep
    break

cut_repr.ListProperties() will show the properties available, one of them
will be Opacity.

Utkarsh

p.s. this is for 3.4. In 3.6 onwards there are easier ways of accessing the
representation.

Message-ID: <c9adba420905260832m3bacb0fm328bc22789887bfd@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Is there a way to let field data be passed when filters are applied?  I have
an unstructured grid with some field data for information such as rotational
speed and I have a filter to calculate common point variables that the users
are interested in, e.g. mach number, total temperature etc..  Unfortunately
the field data does not get copied when applying cuts.  Is there a way to
handle this?  - I would ideally like the users to limit their data before
performing calculations on the data as it is quicker and saves resources.

Thanks,
Paul

and the first thing I see is it needs 3.6 or higher.  So, I update my  
code from cvs (cvsroot/ParaView3), rebuild, run the app (on OSX):
.../bin/paraview.app/Contents/MacOS/paraview

and see "Kitware ParaView 3.5.0 (development)" across the top of the  
GUi.

Q: is this really 3.5 or not?  If not, is there a way to check what  
version I'm running?

I'm hoping the fact that I can do the following means that I am indeed  
running >=3.6 (but maybe not):

 >>> from paraview.simple import *
 >>> cone = Cone()

thanks, Randy

Are you sure the update happened correctly (cvs update -dAP). With the
current CVS head, you should see "Kitware ParaView 3.7.0 (development)" as
the title.

3.5 was the development version in which the new python scripting was
introduced. So if you have 3.5 depending on what date it was checked out,
some features mentioned in the article (will or will not) work.

Thanks for your reply, Utkarsh.  Just another case of stupid user.   
"3.7.0" does indeed appear across the top of my GUI.  I was mistakenly  
pointing to another version before.  Onward...

Subject: [Paraview] How can I use Cg libraries in Paraview?
Message-ID: <d0767b160905261632u7166a481jf55549d0d2b7e384@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone.
I am trying to test some cg programs with Paraview, especially volume
rendering programs. It seems that Paraview use opengl arb extension for
volume rendering (vtkOpenGLVolumeTexture3D.cxx). I am wondering how should I
change Paraview's cmakelists files so that I can compile and use cg programs
in Paraview? For instance, I want to use a cg fragment program to replace
the arb fragment program(.asm) in vtkOpenGLVolumeTexture3D.cxx, how to
correctly include cg header and lib files so that no error occurs when
compiling vtkOpengGLVolumeTexture3D.cxx?
Thanks very much for your help!

After pondering this, and getting feedback from the developers, we decided this really is a good idea.  I wrote up feature request # 9072 in the ParaView bug tracker.

Hi Peter:

    The format of your geometry files (e.g., example0001.geo) is invalid.
Please go to pp.489 (the lower section), EnSight Manual v8.2 (
http://vis.lbl.gov/NERSC/Software/ensight/docs82/UserManual.pdf) to find the
valid format for ASCII-based geometry files. Simply put, the part index
needs to be provided in a geometry file (e.g., example0001.geo), as
indicated in pp.490 (the upper section), which is registered via
vtkEnSightGoldReader::ReadGeometryFile(const char* fileName, int
timeStep, vtkMultiBlockDataSet
*output), specifically by
vtkEnSightGoldReader::CreateUnstructuredGridOutput(int partId, charline[256],
const char* name, vtkMultiBlockDataSet *compositeOutput). This part-index is
later accessed in vtkEnSightGoldReader::ReadScalarsPerElement(const char*
fileName, const char* description, int timeStep, vtkMultiBlockDataSet
*compositeOutput, int numberOfComponents, int component).

   Please note that the EnSight Manual also mandates that coordinates be
listed one value per line in an ASCII-based geometry file (e.g.,
example0001.geo) and it is also the case with scalar values (e.g.,
example0001.temp, and example0001.o2). Also note that "part 1" is invalid
and the two words need to be placed in two separate lines.

   Please double-check all of your files, make them compliant with valid
EnSight file formats, and upload the resulting files to Mantis in case you
still encounter any problems.

   Thanks.

Jona,

Look at the attached script.
For volume rendering you need to specify the scalar to use for volume
rendering as well as the color lookup table as well as the scalar opacity
function. The attached script illustrates how to do the same.

Subject: [Paraview] Multi-Valued Point Scalar Field
Message-ID: <291126.7148.qm@web110116.mail.gq1.yahoo.com>

Hi,

Is it possible to have a multi-valued point scalar field ? I mean, suppose all the points of my model have an integer number associated with them. But I would like some points to have not only one value, but two values (in the same vtkPointData object). So, if a point has the values 1 and 3, I would be able to "capture" it using the threshold filter with lower and upper values equal 1 OR with lower and upper values equal 3.

Is there a way to do this ? Any suggestion will be appreciated.

Regards,
Rafael March.

Subject: [Paraview] Order of Pipeline execution Question for Custom GUI Panel
Message-ID: <F285AC70-DCC6-42AB-BE04-E69FE5D46E5C@bluequartz.net>

I am creating a Custom Qt Panel for a Plugin that I am writing.  
Currently it works "ok" but I would like to add some "polish" to it.  
One of the problems is that I would like to fill in some text fields  
with values that are not known until the RequestInformation() method  
is executed. I am having some trouble getting some values back out of  
my custom class (vtkH5RoboMetReader) and into the gui. I can get some  
read-only QLabels to fill in but not any text fields that are actually  
used for inputs to the filter. (Am I making sense?)

   I have 6 QLineEdits that correspond to the 6 values of a VOI  
(integers). They have some default values set in the xml file but  
those default values don't really work well. I would like to be able  
to  have the RequestInformation() method called (which it is), fill in  
the values, and then be able to read those values back out on the GUI  
side and fill in the VOI QLineEdits with those values.

  Has anyone done this or something like it?

This is with ParaView from CVS (and 3.4 also).

Thanks

Is there a reason that you can't use 2 point scalar fields for this?  You'd
have to have separate names for each point scalar field array.

Hi,

What is the status of the xmol xyz and gaussian cube filters?

I could not load xmol xyz and the .cube file showed me only a set of data.
paraview 3.4 and cvs version the same.

The threshold filter does not directly support multiple scalar fields, but you can use the array calculator filter to construct boolean queries.  Make the calculator expression something like (value_a = 1) | (value_b = 3).  Then you can threshold the result.

Hi,

Is it possible to have a multi-valued point scalar field ? I mean, suppose all the points of my model have an integer number associated with them. But I would like some points to have not only one value, but two values (in the same vtkPointData object). So, if a point has the values 1 and 3, I would be able to "capture" it using the threshold filter with lower and upper values equal 1 OR with lower and upper values equal 3.

Is there a way to do this ? Any suggestion will be appreciated.

Regards,
Rafael March.

Message-ID: <c9adba420905270842j1f740695g406a8295403bc958@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am trying to use the "UseDirectoryName" hint for my source that requires a
directory.  Below is my xml file:

8<-----------------------------------------------------------
<ServerManagerConfiguration>
  <ProxyGroup name="sources">
    <SourceProxy name="MySource" class="vtkMySource" label="MySource">

      <StringVectorProperty name="Directory"
                            command="SetDirectory"
                            number_of_elements="1">
          <FileListDomain name="files"/>
          <Hints>
              <UseDirectoryName />
          </Hints>
      </StringVectorProperty>

      <Hints>
          <Property name="Directory" show="1"/>
      </Hints>
  </SourceProxy>
  </ProxyGroup>
</ServerManagerConfiguration>
----------------------------------------------------------->8

This isn't doing what I would expect - it is just giving a file dialog where
any file can be selected.  If I select a directory and click "ok", it will
just open that directory and list the files in the dialog.

Any help would be appreciated,
Paul

Hi Peter:

A sample EnSight Gold dataset involving ASCII-based geometry, 'scalar per
element', and 'vector per element' files may be found through
VTKData/Data/EnSight/TEST.case. This CASE file references some associated
files:

======
geometry:   test.geo
scalar per element:   test.pressure.0001
vector per element:   test.velocity.0001
.....
======

You may update your CASE dataset based on this sample one.

It is the responsibility of the individual filter implementation to copy or not copy the field data.  However, I don't really understand your question because the slice (a.k.a. cut) filter does copy the field data, so what is the problem?

Hi,

Is there a way to let field data be passed when filters are applied?  I have an unstructured grid with some field data for information such as rotational speed and I have a filter to calculate common point variables that the users are interested in, e.g. mach number, total temperature etc..  Unfortunately the field data does not get copied when applying cuts.  Is there a way to handle this?  - I would ideally like the users to limit their data before performing calculations on the data as it is quicker and saves resources.

Thanks,
Paul

Hello Zhanping,

thanks, it's working now!
The files I uploaded have been in Ensight6 case file format and actually the ens_checker said the files are valid when checking only one timestep. However, I have taken your hint and changed my script to ensight gold case format. Again ens_checker said the resulting files were ok, but Paraview still didn't load the data. I could not find the file Test.case so I started to compare my files with the elements.case in the VTKData/Data/EnSight/ directory. It turned out that I had a few leading blanks in front of some keywords (e.g. ' part' instead of 'part') and also the second comment line in the .geo-file was blank. After changing both issues, Paraview now runs perfectly fine. 
Thanks again for your help!

Regards,

Peter

Subject: [Paraview] [paraview] using with python to make animation in 3.7

Message-ID: <C8D3F57E07352C4B9C8E779E2B27B9EA0EA0CD@LAXA.intra.cea.fr>


Hi all,

I rewrote a animation script with the new module servermanager in Paraview 3.7.
I don't understand why the moving is different with old module severmanager.
I had attached the 2 scripts in my email.

Thanks in advance for your kind help.

Regards, 
Jona

Hi everyone,

I just answer my own question :)
If you create a 3d-array(i,j,k) it will look like this:

Fortran-App:
  [iii][iii][iii]  [iii][iii][iii]  [iii][iii][iii]
 [       j       ][       j       ][       j       ]
[                         k                         ]

C/C++-App:
  [kkk][kkk][kkk]  [kkk][kkk][kkk]  [kkk][kkk][kkk]
 [       j       ][       j       ][       j       ]
[                         i                         ]

Saving an array from Fortran to HDF5 or from C/C++ to HDF5 results in
ZYX or XYZ

Therefor problem is not Xdmf, but the difference between Fortran-Style
and C/C++-Style

Greetings
Jens

Subject: [Paraview] Problem with temporal filter and multi-block data
Message-ID: <56281f5e0905290232q55ec5331u3a7ab2c589d40603@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I use paraview to view results of transient combined finite discrete
element analyses.
My *.pvd input files look like this:

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<VTKFile type="Collection" version="0.1" byte_order="LittleEndian">
<Collection>
<DataSet timestep="0,0000000000e+00" group="0" part="0"
file="se_relax_p_000000000.vtp"/>
<DataSet timestep="0,0000000000e+00" group="0" part="1"
file="se_relax_c_000000000.vtp"/>
<DataSet timestep="0,0000000000e+00" group="0" part="2"
file="se_relax_r_000000000.vtp"/>
<DataSet timestep="0,0000000000e+00" group="0" part="3"
file="se_relax_f_000000000.vtu"/>
<DataSet timestep="1,0000000000e-03" group="0" part="0"
file="se_relax_p_000002000.vtp"/>
<DataSet timestep="1,0000000000e-03" group="0" part="1"
file="se_relax_c_000002000.vtp"/>
.
.
.

The results are stored for each part (DE, contact, rigid-boundaries,
FE) and time step in a single *.vtp / *.vtu file.
I can load the *.pvd file into paraview apply non-temporal filters to
the single parts and animate without problems.
Now I wrote a temporal filter to show the trajectories of data points.
It requires a time series of datasets
with constant number of points and generates the trajectories of the
points as a single PolyData.
The filter works fine if my input does not consist of multiple parts:

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<VTKFile type="Collection" version="0.1" byte_order="LittleEndian">
<Collection>
<DataSet timestep="0,0000000000e+00" group="0" part="0"
file="se_relax_p_000000000.vtp"/>
<DataSet timestep="1,0000000000e-03" group="0" part="0"
file="se_relax_p_000002000.vtp"/>
<DataSet timestep="2,0000000000e-03" group="0" part="0"
file="se_relax_p_000004000.vtp"/>
.
.
.

But if I load my complete data with multiple parts and apply the
ExtractBlock filter first to show the
trajectories for one part only, ParaView complains:

ERROR: In /home/wellmann/program/ParaView-3.4.0/VTK/Filtering/vtkDemandDrivenPipeline.cxx,
line 822
vtkCompositeDataPipeline (0x1e6bbc0): Input for connection index 0 on
input port index 0 for algorithm vtkExtractBlock(0x11f4ddc0) is of
type vtkTemporalDataSet, but a vtkMultiBlockDataSet is required.

In writing the filter I tried to follow the "Time Dependent Processing
in a Parallel Pipeline Architecture" paper
and was geared to the vtkTemporalInterpolation filter. However I am
not confident about how this temporal
stuff works out: In my understanding my filter tells the upstream part
of the pipeline to loop over the requested
time steps and join the data into a TemporalDataSet that my
vtkTrajectories filter can work with. Indeed if I connect
any non temporal filter to the upstream pipeline part (instead of the
vtkTrajectories filter) I can animate over the time-steps
so the upstream pipeline is able to provide data sets for each time
step. Furthermore, as said above, the filter works
fine if there is no multiblock data as source of the pipeline.

Thanks for any hints, Christian
(the filter files are attached)

Jens,

Yes, this is a problem several people have run across.
There will be some solution in a future release. We'll
probably need some type of fast transpose routines that
do it in memory (potential memory hog) and/or as the
data is read (potentially slow due to multiple
IO calls).

Subject: [Paraview] XML source questions
Message-ID: <c19fcadc0905290539u5ce35406ye338300d3cd260ee@mail.gmail.com>

I am looking at the HelixSource xml example. With something like this:
     <StringVectorProperty
       name="NumberOfRounds"
       command="SetParameter"
       number_of_elements="2"
       default_values_delimiter=";"
       default_values="rounds;3">
     </StringVectorProperty>

It is displaying a label with a description of the property, a textbox with
the name of the property, and another textbox with the value of the
property. Is there anyway to skip the textbox with the name of the property
(because it doesn't really make sense for the user to change this - so why
allow it?)

Also, the script itself seems to be set like this:
     <StringVectorProperty
        name="Script"
        command="SetScript"
        number_of_elements="1"
        default_values="import math;&#xa;pdo =
self.GetPolyDataOutput()&#xa;&#xa;newPts = vtk.vtkPoints()&#xa;for i in
range(0, numPts):&#xa;   x = i*float(length)/float(numPts)&#xa;   y =
math.sin(i*rounds*2*math.pi/numPts)&#xa;   z =
math.cos(i*rounds*2*math.pi/numPts)&#xa;   newPts.InsertPoint(i,
x,y,z)&#xa;&#xa;pdo.SetPoints(newPts)&#xa;aPolyLine =
vtk.vtkPolyLine()&#xa;&#xa;aPolyLine.GetPointIds().SetNumberOfIds(numPts)&#xa;for
i in range(0,numPts):&#xa;   aPolyLine.GetPointIds().SetId(i,
i)&#xa;&#xa;pdo.Allocate(1,
1)&#xa;pdo.InsertNextCell(aPolyLine.GetCellType(),
aPolyLine.GetPointIds())&#xa;">
     </StringVectorProperty>

That is a pretty cryptic way to have to write code - is there a way to take
a normal looking script:
import math
pdo = self.GetPolyDataOutput()
newPts = vtk.vtkPoints()
etc.

and point the xml to it - so you can edit the script in a .py file and the
xml just points to that file? This also kind of stems from the first
question - but I also would like to NOT display the script in the GUI - only
the tunable parameters - is that possible?

Thanks,

David

There's no way to get detail information about cell types i.e. number of
polys, number of verts etc. in a poly-data. However I am not sure I
understand your reason for having the verts. Do the triangles include all
the X points? If so, you can always swicth to "Points" representation and
look at those without glyphing.

Utkarsh,

There is a GetNumberOfPolys and a GetNumberOfVerts function, right? (
http://www.vtk.org/doc/release/4.2/html/classvtkPolyData.html#z564_2).

You are right about the points being displayed in representation=points - I
guess I was confused because if you write a file with no topology (only
points), the points do not get displayed even in representation=points mode.
I assumed that when you turned off the only available topology (the
triangles), that the points would not be displayed even in
representation=points for the same reason, that's why I always carried
vertices around too. I should've just tried it I guess!

Thanks,

David

I meant through the information panel or such in ParaView, not VTK directly.
You certainly have the information if you have access to the data directly.

Subject: [Paraview] Problem with temporal filter and multi-block data
In-Reply-To: <56281f5e0905290232q55ec5331u3a7ab2c589d40603@mail.gmail.com>
Message-ID: <C6458D85.9A96%kmorel@sandia.gov>

I am confused about the order of operations you are doing to get the error (since it apparently only happens if you do things in a certain way).  Are you loading the data, attaching your temporal filter to the reader, and then attaching the extract block to your temporal filter?  Or are you loading the data, attaching extract block to the reader, and then attaching your temporal filter to extract block?  Or are you loading the data, attaching the temporal filter to the reader, and then attaching extract block to the reader too?

Hi all,

I use paraview to view results of transient combined finite discrete
element analyses.
My *.pvd input files look like this:

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<VTKFile type="Collection" version="0.1" byte_order="LittleEndian">
<Collection>

<DataSet timestep="1,0000000000e-03" group="0" part="1"
file="se_relax_c_000002000.vtp"/>
.
.
.

The results are stored for each part (DE, contact, rigid-boundaries,
FE) and time step in a single *.vtp / *.vtu file.
I can load the *.pvd file into paraview apply non-temporal filters to
the single parts and animate without problems.
Now I wrote a temporal filter to show the trajectories of data points.
It requires a time series of datasets
with constant number of points and generates the trajectories of the
points as a single PolyData.
The filter works fine if my input does not consist of multiple parts:

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<VTKFile type="Collection" version="0.1" byte_order="LittleEndian">
<Collection>
<DataSet timestep="0,0000000000e+00" group="0" part="0"
file="se_relax_p_000000000.vtp"/>
<DataSet timestep="1,0000000000e-03" group="0" part="0"
file="se_relax_p_000002000.vtp"/>
<DataSet timestep="2,0000000000e-03" group="0" part="0"
file="se_relax_p_000004000.vtp"/>
.
.
.

But if I load my complete data with multiple parts and apply the
ExtractBlock filter first to show the
trajectories for one part only, ParaView complains:

ERROR: In /home/wellmann/program/ParaView-3.4.0/VTK/Filtering/vtkDemandDrivenPipeline.cxx,
line 822
vtkCompositeDataPipeline (0x1e6bbc0): Input for connection index 0 on
input port index 0 for algorithm vtkExtractBlock(0x11f4ddc0) is of
type vtkTemporalDataSet, but a vtkMultiBlockDataSet is required.

In writing the filter I tried to follow the "Time Dependent Processing
in a Parallel Pipeline Architecture" paper
and was geared to the vtkTemporalInterpolation filter. However I am
not confident about how this temporal
stuff works out: In my understanding my filter tells the upstream part
of the pipeline to loop over the requested
time steps and join the data into a TemporalDataSet that my
vtkTrajectories filter can work with. Indeed if I connect
any non temporal filter to the upstream pipeline part (instead of the
vtkTrajectories filter) I can animate over the time-steps
so the upstream pipeline is able to provide data sets for each time
step. Furthermore, as said above, the filter works
fine if there is no multiblock data as source of the pipeline.

Thanks for any hints, Christian
(the filter files are attached)

We already branched so if you are building it yourself you can
checkout the ParaView-3-6 branch from cvs. We should have binaries
ready in a few weeks.

There is no way to have a Python script as-is in an XML file. The XML
parsers can't handle it. However, you can have your script import a
module, which is stored as a py file. I believe Ken Moreland from
Sandia implemented support for adding modules to plugins.

As for displaying only the tunable parameters of a Python filter, this
is not yet implemented but it is planned. Custom filters or plugins
will allow the developer to specify a list of parameters for the
programmable filter. Hopefully in 3.8. You can do this currently but
you have to create a plugin with a custom inspector panel.

It depends on the data but if you had to say something generic, I would say:

Pentium IV or above (or equivalent on Unix including PPC for Macs)
512 MB memory
100 MB of disk space

I would recommend some sort of GPU that has hardware acceleration
support for OpenGL but it is not a requirement.

Subject: [Paraview] Scripting the opacity property of a Time Annotation
	filter
Message-ID: <919e0fb50905310010x10a6a9a8nb2f650179fbafbc@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Another animation script question. I am trying to create an animation
movie with the fade-out of a Time Annotation filter using its opacity
property. I have attached a short script that shows what I am trying
to do. However , the script produces the following error:

ERROR: In /tmp/Kitware/ParaView3/Servers/ServerManager/vtkSMRampKeyFrameProxy.cxx,
line 53
vtkSMRampKeyFrameProxy (0xb33c390): Cue does not have domain or property set!

By the way, using the same method to animate the opacity of a Slice
filter works without problems (thank you Utkarsh). Am I missing
something?

Here is the script, you need to create a Annotate Time filter in
ParaView and then run this script from the built-in Python shell:

#!/usr/bin/python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

# parameters
fps = 24.0 # frames/seconds
time = 6.0 #movie length in seconds

# get the view and camera, create the movie
view = servermanager.GetRenderView()
camera = view.GetActiveCamera()
camera.SetParallelProjection(True)
camera.SetViewUp(0.0, 1.0, 0.0)
movie = servermanager.animation.AnimationScene()
movie.ViewModules = [view]
movie.NumberOfFrames = fps * time

# get the annotation and its representation
pm = servermanager.ProxyManager()
anntime = pm.GetProxy("sources", "AnnotateTime1")
anntime_repr = None
for rep in view.Representations:
  if rep.Input[0].Proxy == anntime:
    anntime_repr = rep
    break

# make sure the annotation is visible
anntime_repr.Opacity = 1.0
anntime_repr.Visibility = 1
anntime_repr.Enabled = 1

# fade out the annotation
cue = servermanager.animation.KeyFrameAnimationCue()
cue.StartTime = 0.0
cue.EndTime = 1.0

cue.AnimatedProxy = anntime_repr
cue.AnimatedPropertyName = "Opacity"

keyf0 = servermanager.animation.CompositeKeyFrame();
keyf0.Type = 2 # Set keyframe interpolation type to Ramp.
keyf0.KeyTime = 0.0
keyf0.KeyValues= [1.0]

keyf1 = servermanager.animation.CompositeKeyFrame()
keyf1.KeyTime = 1.0
keyf1.KeyValues = [0.0]

cue.KeyFrames = [keyf0, keyf1]

movie.AddCueProxy(cue)

# Play the animation
movie.Play()

Subject: [Paraview] orientation of cylinder glyph

It looks like the person that wrote it chose to align the cylinder
with the Y axis. Don't ask me why. You can go into vtkCylinderSource
and change it. Or you can do the following:

* Create a cylinder from the sources menu
* Apply transform, rotate around Z 90 degrees
* Apply Glyph With Custom Source and use the transform as the 2nd
input (called source I think)

Subject: [Paraview] How to see 3D Surface
Message-ID: <42c40c4a0905270843y6f478a91w8969c1b82b8f7d37@mail.gmail.com>

hi all,

I am a new user of paraview. I am having vtk files as out put of my
simulation. I can visualize them using paraview but I get only 2D view i.e.,
x, y and vector W=(U(x), V(y) )  (which I think is default). I can
understand the value of W in terms of color using color bar. Could somebody
suggest me how can I see the 3D surface view of these quantities i.e., x,y,
U(x)  and x,y, and V(y). I  am attaching one of my vtk file here for further
detail. Any suggestion or remark in this regards will be a great help.

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView pvserver crashes
Message-ID: <d8a796870905272025s5f66d6d1tbbd5564c216432bb@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I tried setting up a ParaView server on a university cluster, but am getting
the server to crash when remote rendering is enabled.  First off, I suppose
I should ask if I am wise to do this.  I don't see any rules of thumb for
how large a dataset should be for good scaling, or how fast an interconnect
ParaView requires.
I generate fairly large unstructured datasets (in the range of 1-3 million
nodes).  My data files are in the exodus format and generally run in the
hundreds of MB.  My connection to the cluster is limited at 100 MBit, and
the interconnect between cluster nodes is Gigabit.  Even if the speed is
comparable, its nice enough not to need to download the datafiles to my
computer.

The cluster is made up of dual socket quad core machines with pitiful
on-board graphics.  I built ParaView 3.4 on this system with OpenMPI and
Mesa support.

I run the server through a PBS scheduler.  Because the compute nodes are not
directly connected to the outside world, and because I don't know apriori
which nodes the ParaView server will run on, I use a reverse connection.  My
PBS script is attached (paraview_server.sh).  It connects fine, and I am
able to open a dataset.  Once I do something that requires a fair amount of
work (i.e. switching from outline view to surface view) the server crashes.
 I have also attached the output from the server captured by PBS
(o_paraview.log).  Finally so that you can see what I've configured, I've
attached the CMakeCache.txt file from my ParaView build.  Note that in my
script, I've commented out the remote rendering option, it does not crash if
this is left commented out.

Other relevant data is that the cluster is running Ubuntu 8.04 x86_64, and
I'm running the 64bit version of ParaView on Windows Server 2008.  I'm using
the Mesa library provided by the Ubuntu repositories (7.0.3).  The crash
also happens identically if I run the ParaView client over a remote X
session directly from the cluster, so I'm certain its not a problem with
mismatched versions.

My ideas at this point are:
- try building Mesa from source (I'd rather not muck around with having the
repository + custom built version however)
- live without remote rendering (which is quite slow)
- hope someone on the ParaView list has a better idea

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
