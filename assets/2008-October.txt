This might lead to further problems. At present, even very tiny models (2.2 
kBytes file size), which are processed on my desktop (2GB RAM) without any 
effort or delay, crash the server when using "--use-offscreen-rendering".

Yes, quite often ;-) And I think I understood it. 

On which exact platform did you manage to compile a working "offscreen" 
pvserver?

We used on many different Linux clusters as wekk as IBM Blue Gene. I
believe others used it on other Unix systems. Are you seeing any
output from pvserver? Can you run it in a debugger?

Here in our lab we have ParaView compiled with offscreen rendering in 3 
Altix systems (350, 450 and ICE). The offscreen rendering, in our case, 
is not so fast but works fine most of the times (there's some adjusts to 
be made as you must have seen in the wiki's page).

I try to visualize a 400 pieces PVTI with a 64 processors cluster and i have the same problem.
I would be very grateful if someone could tell me if there is a way to fix that.
Thank you in advance.

Since I have had some interest in the code I posted it to the  
following location:

http://echo1.bluequartz.net/CreateParaViewPlugin.tgz


note that it uses the boost::program_options library and Qt4. I  
figured since you are going to generate a plugin for ParaView you  
probably have Qt4 installed anyways. The boost part, well, if someone  
wants to rip that out and use something else lighter weight or has  
another suggestion then let me know.

Eventually I'll put a Qt Gui on it to make it a bit more friendly. I  
was also hoping to create an Eclipse Project Template for ParaView  
plugins for those of us using Eclipse-CDT.

Subject: [Paraview] Multiple Plugins Invoking common library target.
Message-ID: <5AAA7733-6539-4C50-AD93-089D495A072C@bluequartz.net>

I have 2 separate plugins that I am trying to build into ParaView  
using the ParaView_Extra_External_modules variable. The problem that I  
am having is that both plugins call the same Common CMakeLists.txt  
file that builds a common library. CMake is complaining that all the  
targets have to be globally unique. I was hoping that CMake would see  
that the target has already been added and then ignore that  
CMakeLists.txt the 2 time it hit it. Is it possible to push up a  
variable to the parent scope or something to flag paraview that my  
common library has already been added as a target?
    I guess I could go looking in the ParaView_BINARY_DIR for the  
"MXADataModel" directory which I guess would be an indicator that it  
is already in the cmake cache and I can just use the library name  
directly?
  Anyone have any suggestions.

Hi,
 
Is this the right place for a feature request?
 
Is there a way to get (x,y,z) for selected point(s)?  Maybe using a
filter?
 
If not, an intuitive place for me would be in the Selection Inspector.
I'd like it to provide a list of the points selected with ID's and
(x,y,z).  This could be a list box within the Selection Inspector
itself, or else a table in a new view window as for the Integrate
Variables filter.  I'm using 3.2.1.  I need this _all_ the time with
OpenFOAM 1.4.  e.g. Build a mesh, then want to move internal walls
(baffles) around, need an easy way to readily pick points for selection
using OpenFOAM utilities (e.g. faceSet). If there are any OF'ers out
there, does the OF 1.5 paraFoam plugin already do what I need?
 
Cheers
hoogs

Yes. The bug tracker (http://paraview.org/Bug/my_view_page.php) will
also work if there is no resolution.

In 3.2, you can apply the calculator filter with an expression of
iHat*coordsX + jHat *coordsY + kHat * coordsZ, then use the selection
labeling (at the bottom of the selection inspector panel) to show
"Result" in the 3D view.

In 3.4+, the spreadsheet view shows point coordinates automatically
and you don't need to do the above.

I tried changing the flags on that. Currently is local scope:

	dlopen(libname, RTLD_LAZY); 

Anyone of 

	return dlopen(libname, RTLD_LAZY|RTLD_GLOBAL);
	return dlopen(libname, RTLD_LAZY|RTLD_DEEPBIND);

makes the paraview crash on start-up! (even without loading any user-defined 
reader).

Guess a testprogram is needed. Bit strange that there is no problem on OSX - 
seems to use the same code.

Subject: [Paraview] Custom Object Panels
Message-ID: <899697.85651.qm@web110111.mail.gq1.yahoo.com>

Hey all,

I'm creating a filter with a custom Object Panel, but I still have some doubts.

I am able to create a Panel using Qt Designer, and then load it into my filter extending the class pqLoadedFormObjectPanel. Everything works fine. Qt Designer allows me to create some Slots, but in a limited manner. I couldn't find, for instance, how to capture with a Label the name of the item of a tree. This would require some C++ code, I suppose, to get the QString name from the item. So, I thought in just using the Qt Designer to create the Panel, and using C++ code through my panel class, which extends pqLoadedFormObjectPanel, to create Slots and handle the events associated with the widgets. Is it possible to get the widgets which I created with Qt Designer with my Panel class ? If so, how ? I just can't figure out how to do this.

I don't know also the real difference between pqNamedObjectPanel e pqLoadedFormObjectPanel. I saw the Threshold filter, and it seems that it loads a QT Designer created Panel, but extending pqNamedObjectPanel. I saw in the Paraview Wiki that if you want to use QT Designer, you must extend PqLoadedFormObjectPanel...

Well...any tips are appreciated !

Thanks all !
Rafael March

In that case, I prefer to derive from pqNamedObjectPanel instead.
Then I set up the UI myself, and you immediately get pointers to all the 
widgets, instead of having to go find them if you used 
pqLoadedFormObjectPanel.

To get more details on how it works:
http://doc.trolltech.com/4.3/designer-using-a-component.html

Deriving from pqNamedObjectPanel means you use the "Compile Time Form 
Processing."

Deriving from pqLoadedFormObjectPanel means you use the "Run Time Form 
Processing."

On Linux, did you not link libAdditional with libmain?  I assume you doing 
that on the OSX already, or you'd probably get link errors.

Then you shouldn't have order issues with dlopen on Linux and things should 
just work.

I might be doing this wrong, but here goes.  I have a set of points and
associated atomic numbers, and a volume field.  I want to render spheres
colored appropriately for the atom type, and combine them together with
translucent isosurfaces of the volume.

In a filter, I map the atomic numbers to an index (called "mapped atomic
number"), and attach a color lookup table to that point data set which maps
the indices to the color thats appropriate for the atomic number.  Thats a
bit awkward; my LUT has three elements per index, essentially mapping
(index-0.333) to (index+0.333) to the color for that index.  Then I pass
that through the Glyph3D filter and render, and when I tell it to color by
"mapped atomic number" I get what I expect, both when I tell it to
composite and not,  parallel or not.

Unfortunately, when I embed the glyphs in a translucent isosurface it seems
to drop the lookup table.  If I run on 2 nodes and tell it to composite,
half the glyphs are colored without regard for the LUT.  If I tell it not
to composite, none of the glyphs are rendered using the LUT.

Fooling around in the debugger, it seems it uses vtkPolyDataWriter and
vtkPolyDataReader to serialize and de-serialize the data thats being
exchanged between nodes.  I coded up a little experiment that creates a
vtkUnstructuredGrid similar to my input data with a LUT, glyphs it and
vtkPolyDaWriter's it.  The output vtk file doesn't show the LUT, making me
think the LUT is getting dropped when PV moves the data from node to node.

Help!  Is there another way I should be doing this?  Alas, for the moment I
need to use PV2.

I have a basic threaded python script that I wanted to run in ParaView, 
but it seems that whenever you try to run a thread nothing happens in 
the python console. Trying to reset the console window crashes ParaView. 
This seems to be odd because the same script is able to work inside 
pvpython.

Here is the script I was running:

#!/usr/bin/env python
from threading import Thread, Timer

def test():
  print 'hello world'
 
def runTest():
  t = Timer(3,test)
  t.start()

If I understand your email correctly, you are defining a lookup table in a
"VTK Legacy" file and expecting to use that table is ParaView.  To be
honest, that mode of operation is not well supported by ParaView and I'm a
little surprised that it works at all.  There must be a VTK rendering
component grabbing that LUT without ParaView noticing it.  That would also
explain why it stops working when rendering translucent in parallel.  The
translucent parallel rendering does a redistribution of data, at the lookup
table could easily get stripped during that process.

My advice is to not attempt to define a lookup table in the data file.  Use
the color map editor provided by the ParaView GUI (which also allows you to
save and restore maps and to import from and export to XML.  If you really
want to assign colors in the data files, then declare a field array
consisting of 3 or 4-tuple unsigned chars and then render them in dependent
mode (uncheck the "Map Scalars" button in the Display panel).

libAdditional knows about libMain, libMain does not know about libAdditional.

paraview seems to do a dlopen of the reader module (which is linked to 
libMain). libMain then does a dlopen of libAdditional. This works on OSX but 
not on Linux.

An application (that is linked to libMain) does not have problems - libMain 
correctly dlopens libAdditional. It is only the extra dlopen step that 
creates problems.

Hi!
I?m having trouble setting a point data array in my filter:

As I have to retrieve the point data with 
input -> GetPointData() -> GetArray(0) -> GetData(0,numOfTuples,1,1,scalars);

I need something similiar to set the output data of my filter. I tried 
output -> GetPointData() -> AddArray(new_scalars);
where new_scalars is a vtkDoubleArray, but this does not work - how do I set the output correctly?

thx,

Message-ID: <2137e33e0810030541i36f75096r5dca3e97456f15c4@mail.gmail.com>

Over the past year or so, the Titan informatics project led by Sandia
National Laboratories has been developing informatics plugins for
ParaView. These include a network view, a geospatial view, and many
other informatics and statistics filters and views. These plugins,
along with a thin client application called OverView, will be migrated
into the ParaView repository early next week. The new application and
plugins will default to off, so the effect to normal ParaView
checkouts should be minimal. However, there may be some hitches along
the way, so I wanted to give a heads up that ParaView CVS head may not
be stable for a few days starting next Monday. The Titan project
homepage is

https://www.kitware.com/InfovisWiki/index.php

A wiki page briefly outlining what will be moved to ParaView is at

https://www.kitware.com/InfovisWiki/index.php/OverView_Migration

When things settle down, we will send out detailed instructions about
how to try out this new application.

Message-ID: <9bf391330810031322t58834e4bpde7f8942d69e0642@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I am running paraview on a cluster with some success, however, it
seems incredibly slow and crashes often. The cluster has no graphics
hardware so I compiled and installed OSmesa, I then downloaded the
paraview CVS source and changed all open GL and mesa settings as per
the server wiki page. To circumvent firewall issues I ssh to the
cluster and start pvserver with the --use-offscreen-rendering flag. I
found I still got the bad X server connection message but this did not
lead to an immediate crash and although it was slow I could manipulate
everything up to a point (see below). Then, I downloaded and compiled
3.2.3 and I no longer observe the bad X server connection error but it
still seems very slow and still crashes frequently. I have
successfully performed the test under 'Paraview does not scale' on the
server wiki page. I tried a 6M then 1M cell unstructured grid (ensight
file with one zone) containing a velocity vector and 4 other variables
running on various combinations up to 112 processors (14 nodes x 8
processors per node & 8GB RAM per node) but it still seems slow. When
I look at the CPU load logs all processors are maxed out more that 95%
of the time. Typically my work flow is something as follows:
Import File
D3
Extract Surface
Perform 2 clips on extracted surface
Add streamlines (this frequently causes a crash however coarse I make
the settings)
Make 1 of the clips opaque (almost always crashes)
Often it also hangs after viewer manipulation or even just upon
selection of a different filter.

My questions:
Perhaps my expectations of the MESA library are too optimistic and
paraview really requires graphics hardware to run smoothly?
Has anyone got experience of which MPI library performs best? We have
openmpi gnu & intel, mpich2 & SCore and willing to install more :-)
Are there any benchmarks/tools that would give an indication of
whether the cluster is under performing / where the bottleneck is?
It's a new cluster and we don't have any software that we use
regularly with enough licences to test over all the cores.
On smaller grids on my desktop with a fairly recent graphics card the
serial paraview client zips along and does almost everything (see
below) I could wish for so I hope there are some tips out there to
improve the parallel performance.

Second:
When I have a streamtrace with attached glyph can I control the glyph
seeding so that spheres are plotted at fixed time intervals along the
streamtrace i.e. in low velocity regions spheres are bunched up and
conversely spread out in high velocity regions.

Thanks for reading this far and thanks in advance for any
comments/tips/solutions,
Tim

Subject: [Paraview] Decent video card for ParaView on AMD Phenom board?
Message-ID: <200810041918.22017.repsons@gmail.com>

Hello in list!
Building a new workstation I got confused about video card. 
What would be a decent video card for Phenom or Intel quad board, that is used 
for hydrodynamics, deformation and free surface visualization? I didn't 
provide much of information, but there should be some sane choices for 
Phenom's computing power (that is - results it can produce for visualization 
in reasonable amount of time). And yes, supported by ParaView as much as 
possible / necessary. 
Your answer appreciated...

I would recommend getting the best nvidia card you can afford,
specially if you are going to visualize large datasets. The GeForce
series is probably the best choice.

Thanks for reply, GeForce was my choice already, just I doubt model and the 
video memory size.

How about 
http://www.asus.com/products.aspx?l1=2&l2=6&l3=514&l4=0&model=1642&modelmenu=1
for cases with 100K cells typically?
What happens if I postprocess 1M cells?

MarkMail (www.markmail.org) has imported the Paraview/VTK mailing lists

good way to search the mailing lists.

To search all of the lists, this URL can be used:

To limit the search, either of these URLs can be used:

Could someone please relay this information to the vtk lists? I'm not

Subject: [Paraview] Strange things happening when executing a new filter
Message-ID: <BAY122-W18590A8B94C2B3A2E25295BC390@phx.gbl>


Hi!
I?ve written a new filter for paraview and built it as a plugin. This works fine, apart the fact that my filter does not work correctly, i.e. paraview breaks down when I execute it. 
Well, I?ve started debugging it using a std::ofstream, which writes some values of my filter in a logfile so I can check them for correctness (i.e. did I get the correct point data, do I set the output points correctly, etc. ) 
Strangely, I noticed that paraview does not call my filter once, but twice when I press the apply button. According to the logfile, the first time my function is called, there are no problems, i.e. it gets to the end and returns, later it is called again and does not finish because an error occurs. 
I wanted to find out if this behaviour, that a filter?s Execute function is called twice is normal, and let the vtkShrinkFilter write something in my file when it is called. The vtkShrinkFilter is just called once, as I would expect. 

Does anyone have an idea why my filter is called twice? If you need more information, just tell me, I?m not sure how much or how little to write so you can understand my problem.. 

thx,
NH

Executing twice is _not_ normal for a vtk pipeline. First thing to  
check is that during your RequestData(...) method you are not setting  
values of your class using a "Setter" method. This will cause your  
class to get marked as "modified" and the pipeline will run again.

There are also some interactions with "sub-pipelines" within your  
RequestData(...) method that can cause your filter to execute multiple  
times. Check for that also.

Message-ID: <b0a936c00810060642h66f8c485pf50f8d789a3e68fb@mail.gmail.com>

I have 2D scalar field as shown in figure scalar_2d.png.
I apply 'Gradient' and 'Stream Tracer' filters respectively.
stream_2d.png is the resulting figure. But obviously that's wrong. Is there
something I am doing wrong?

Many thanks,

Did you set the name for new_scalars?  If the array has no name, it probably
won't show up in ParaView.  Use the SetName method in vtkDoubleArray.

Since the first version was a complete kludge I spent some more time  
with this little project and basically rewrote it. The program now  
uses template files for the source code instead of having all the ugly  
code-creating-code thing. This also makes it easier to customize the  
end code for your purposes without having to recompile.

Again, the download location is the same:

Subject: [Paraview] Forcing a Qt version
Message-ID: <48EB6370.6040708@nacad.ufrj.br>


Hi folks,

I'm facing a curious problem here. I was using Qt-4.3.4 to compile 
ParaView in a Windows machine and it had been working fine but after 
installing a second version of Qt (4.4.2), CMake 2.6 (patch 2 RC-5) 
seems to be getting confused about which version it should use. Even 
pointing QT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE to Qt-4.3.4, CMake insists in pointing all 
other stuffs to Qt-4.4.2 paths (QT_DOC_DIR, QT_INCLUDE_DIR, 
QT_LIBRARY_DIR and so on...). In my environment I have set 
QT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE to Qt-4.3.4 but it's not solving the problem. Is 
there any other environment variable that could be used to force CMake 
in using the correct version of Qt?

Regards

Renato.

You can set QTDIR to the installation directory. CMake will try to use  
that variable if it finds it. Also, once the Qt libraries and stuff is  
set in a build directory it is pretty hard to get it to change.  
Clearing the build directory and starting out again with the QTDIR env  
variable set should help you find the correct version.

Alternately you can open the CMakeCache.txt and remove all traces of  
ANY variable with QT in its name. This isn't exactly the preferred way  
to trouble shoot this problem but has worked in the past, plus saves  
all your compiled code from having to be recompiled.

Hi Michael,

there's something overriding my QTDIR because CMake still points to the 
wrong Qt version. I've set both QT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE and QTDIR to 3.3.4 
version, but CMake still returns me a warning that I'm using an 
unsupported version of Qt. Now I'm trying to understand all that CMake 
sintaxe in FindQt4.cmake and UseQt4.cmake modules.

weird, isn't it?!

    Assuming you really meant Qt 4.3.4 and NOT Qt 3.3.4 here is what  
you need to do.

Remove everything from your build directory so we can start clean.
Go to "My Computer" and add/check/set the QTDIR (Capitalization  
counts) to your Qt 4 installation.
Launch CMakeSetup or CMake-GUI.exe and configure ParaView. You should  
at most get a warning about the version of Qt your are using and the  
"required" version.

Everything _should_ work.

Now, if you are really trying to use Qt 3 instead of Qt 4 then that is  
not supported. YOu need at least Qt 4.3 to build ParaView.

If there's a qmake in your PATH, it takes precedence over whatever you 
set QTDIR to be.
By the way, the use of QTDIR has been deprecated by Trolltech.
Another thing you can do is set QT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE in the cmake-gui 
before you hit configure for the first time, and it won't matter what 
your PATH is.

Michael and Clinton

I guess I'm facing a CMake's bug. I'm actually working with two Qt4 
versions: Qt 4.4.2 (official distribution, including VS2008 integration) 
and Qt 4.3.4 (open source distribution). I've set the QTDIR variable as 
Michael suggested (in two places. Firstly in my own environment 
variables and secondly in the system's variables) but it had not worked. 
After that I downgraded CMake to 2.6.2 (official release), same problem.

Clinton, setting the QT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE in CMake was the first thing I 
tried (take a look at here 
http://www.nacad.ufrj.br/~rnelias/paraview/qt.JPG). It should be the 
easiest way. CMake keeps my set but mix with the other Qt stuffs with 
the newest version (4.4.2). Thus, when I try to launch the compiled PV I 
get an error message saying that it's not possible to find the entry 
point of the procedure ?focusNextPrevChild at QGraphicsView@@MAE_N_N at Z in 
dynamic library QtGui4.dll. My guess, is that Visual Studio is "qmaking" 
with version 4.3.4 and linking against 4.4.2.

By the way, should PV3 work with 4.4.2? Has anybody tried it?

Regards

Renato

Is it possible to apply a texture to an object using ParaView 3.2.1?  Are there conditions, such as the data must include normals, or it cannot be an unstructured mesh?

Thanks,

I can now see the problem (actually multiple problems).  The first problem
is that the spacing in the Z direction is a negative value.  That is
apparently not really supported and I'm seeing some screwy behavior based on
that.  Changing the spacing values to be all positive numbers fixes that
problem.

The second issue I see is that the streamline filter is not working properly
on 2D images that are defined in the x-z plane (as yours is).  That's a bug
in ParaView and I've submitted a bug report
(http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=7787).  You can get around the
problem by either defining your images in the x-y plane or by converting to
an unstructured type (either Clean to Grid or Extract Surface will work) and
run the streamline filter on that.

Yeah I used to fight with it too. It is far from clean. I do not recall now 
the details, but what did the trick for me was to specify QMAKE_EXECUTABLE 
(or something) and QT_DESIRED_VERSION (or something)

Hello -

I'm having difficulty debugging the following brief VTP file generated 
by my custom exporter -- I can't seem to figure out why Paraview won't 
open it. Is there some sort of syntax error in it?

Thanks,

I don't think you can with 3.2.1, but you will soon be able to with 3.4.  The conditions are that texture coordinates must be set.  They can be set with the Texture Map To... filters.

The bad X server connection errors you are getting are suspect.  A pvserver
that is properly using OSMesa should not ever attempt to connect to an X11
server.

I gave up and employed the dirtiest solution. Deleted Qt 4.3.4 and used 
Qt 4.4.2. Nothing more to choose, CMake finally got convinced that I 
only have one Qt version...

...In the end, instead of forcing a Qt version CMake forced me to delete 
one of them :o(

I do multiple Qt versions simply by modifying my PATH before the first time I 
run cmake on an empty build directory.

To verify that, I can run "qmake --version" from a console/terminal, to make 
sure its the right one before I run cmake for the first time.

Here's another small vtp file that Paraview won't open. I'm getting the 
error: "Cannot read cell connectivity from Polys in piece 0 because the 
"connectivity" array is not long enough."

Can someone please tell me what I'm missing.

Thanks

Each cell in the connectivity array needs to be of the form "N id0 id1
id2..." where N is the number of points in the cell and idX are the indices
to the points.  It looks like your connectivity array is missing the count.

I believe the offsets array should be the index of the start of each cell.
Generally, the first one is always 0.

Nope, I believe this is only for the legacy file formats. The example
XML polydata file doesn't have this:
http://www.vtk.org/pdf/file-formats.pdf

I don't think this is right either (again referring to the example in
the file format spec).

As far as I can tell, the problem with the XML polydata file below is
that the "offsets" array in the <Polys> section has a value of 10 but
there are only 3 points in the "connectivity" array. Try changing the 10
to a 3.

I think the big clue here is the "empty build directory". I use multiple 
Qt versions and CMake is quite pathological about them. If you try to 
switch from one version to another, you really need to wipe the build 
directory. What I usually do is edit the cache files, by doing a search 
replace for all paths from the old Qt and replace them with the new. But 
even this still sometimes manages to confuse CMake due to configured 
"other files" all over the place. To be sure you really have to wipe all 
cache stuff and make sure the new QMake is on your path before rerunning 
ccmake.

Subject: [Paraview] How to use TkInter in paraview python shell ?
Message-ID: <BE82E22A6D5642F395ED605B7A5B66DD@dcgh>

Hello,

I have to develop a small GUI for a python script connected to pvservermanager. I would like to use Tkinter.

I used paraview 3.2.1 on windows XP installed directly from packaged binaries.

When I try to import Tkinter, I got the message
>>> import Tkinter
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<console>", line 1, in <module>
  File "C:\Programs\ParaView 3.2.1\bin\lib\lib-tk\Tkinter.py", line 38, in <module>
    import _tkinter # If this fails your Python may not be configured for Tk
ImportError: No module named _tkinter
>>> 

For example in a standalone python 24 installation, there is also Tkinter.py in python24/Lib/lib-tk folder, 
_tkinter.lib on python24/libs folder and tk84.dll in python24/dlls folder.

In the paraview python installation, there is only Tkinter.py in paraview/Lib/lib-tk.

Is somebody has already solved this problem ?

Thanks
Guy

Hi John, in my case I also tried to clean all files from my build 
directory (uncountable times) before changing Qt version, but it has not 
worked either (this screen shot was taken from one of my tries 
http://www.nacad.ufrj.br/~rnelias/paraview/qt.JPG). The only thing that 
I have not tested was the hand edition of cache files. Something 
(probably me) must have messed up my system or CMake really have a big 
problem in distinguishing between different versions of the same library 
(especially Qt).

I finally gave up in struggling with CMake and deleted the older version 
of Qt (it's easier to decide when you don't have options ;o). In fact, I 
was keeping version 4.3.4 in my machine just because I thought it were 
mandatory for ParaView 3.3.x compilation, and it's not (at least I 
haven't found any incompatibility yet).

Anyway, bug or one more weirdness of the software's world...

Renato.

Message-ID: <48ECFD0C.6030206@nacad.ufrj.br>


Hey Kitware folks,

this morning I was playing with some of the Render View parameters and 
found something that could be adjusted:

in "Remote Rendering Parameters" there's a check box saying "disable 
ordered compositing". It's quite weird enable a checkbox to disable 
something. Since it's a checkbox, it should be used to enable/disable 
things, isn't it?! Thus, my proposal would be changing it to just 
"ordered compositing" so as the state enabled/disabled follow the state 
of the checkbox.

Just a suggestion ;o)

Renato.

It sounds like you have to build your own version of ParaView using
your own Python. ParaView comes prepackaged with a subset of Python
and it is not trivial to add to it. Follow the instructions on the
ParaView wiki to build your own ParaView.
I considered not bundling Python with ParaView but that would require
all users to first install Python, which is not an ideal solution...

To isolate the streamline issue, try disabling remote render and make
the streamlines small enough so that the client can handle rendering
them. If you are still experiencing crashes, you are probably running
into a bug in the streamline filter. The parallel version of that
filter needs some more work...

As for issues with opaque clips, make sure that you are using the very
latest version of Mesa. It has some fixes that are related to
transparency.

It is not the size of the data but the size of the geometry you are
going to extract from it. Using the appropriate LOD settings, I think
you can handle geometry generated from 1M cells using that card as
long as you are smart about the filters/settings you use.

Renato,

That is a good point.  However, the reason for the current wording is that
the "ordered compositing" feature is never something that is always on.  It
turns itself on when transparent objects are being rendered.  The option
gives you the ability to disable the feature so that it never works, but
there is no way to always have ordered compositing on.

I fear flipping the option and naming it something like "ordered
compositing" would incorrectly suggest that you would be turning on ordered
compositing for all rendering.  What if the behavior stays the same but make
the name sound like a more positive action like "suppress ordered
compositing"?

Thanks David! (It worked)

One final question: do the newer VTK/XML file formats support color like 
the legacy format? I'd like to attribute colors to the various entities 
in my files.

Yes and no. You can define arrays on points and cells using
the <PointData> and <CellData> tags. You can use the
Scalars, Vectors, Normals, Tensors, and TCoords attributes
in these tags to indicate a default array (to be used for
coloring, contouring, or many other operations). However
I do not believe the XML file formats support storing a
color lookup table along with scalar data like the legacy
format's LOOKUP_TABLE.

Hi everybode,
I have written a filter for paraview and it works well when applied to one file, applied to a time series of files the filter is executed a few times (precisely: 4 times) before paraview breaks down. Does anyone have an idea what might be the problem here?
thx,

I would first make sure my filter works as a regular vtk method before using 
it with PV. There is a lot of possible errors to make. You have to say more 
before somebody can possibly help. How do you write your plugin? Do you 
derive from Algorithm classes?

I see what you mean. In this case, "suppress" really seems more proper 
than "disable". The problem with "disable" is that the word has a strong 
correlation with check boxes. Check boxes only do this (enable/disable 
things).

my 2 cents ;o)

Is the CocoaRender window affected by this bug?

Subject: [Paraview] Volume render color scale
Message-ID: <48EE0E52.6020002@nacad.ufrj.br>


Hi folks, does anybody know if it's possible to configure the volume 
rendering color scale before applying it? It's hard to set the scale 
since ParaView tries to automatically render the image every time we 
release the mouse button. Maybe an apply button in the color scale 
editor would help in this case...

Regards

Renato.

I don't know. It should be relatively easy to write a simple example
that demonstrates the issue. I'll put in in my huge list of things to
do unless someone else volunteers.

Message-ID: <92f19da0810091037w15aaa0fbyc5f021e10cc9b95d@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am solving problems of the nodes and edges of a tetrahedral mesh.
Since nodes and edges are the only entities I am writing out to the
vtu file, I am only seeing the color data on the individual lines.

Is there anyway to visualize the data so the node and edge data is
visualized over the entire volume?  It would be great to see a solid
block of colors, which I can slice through and see a continuous
surface, instead of a bunch of points.

Thanks in advance,

Juan

You could run your data through the Delaunay 3D filter to generate
tetrahedra connecting the nodes.

Thanks for your response.

Applying the filter causes my device and data to disappear.  Could it
be that having a device which is 1e-5x1e-5x1e-5 might be causing the
algorithm to not work properly?

I am using the 3.3.1 development version and am now recompiling the newest one.

Thanks,

Juan

Try the transform filter to change the scale of your model to verify
if it is the size that is causing the problem.

Subject: [Paraview] Can I speed up animations if my mesh structure is
	constant?
Message-ID: <432C435C-B4E4-4143-A8D9-9039199CAF08@jhu.edu>

Is there a way to speed up Paraview when visualizing animate-able  
point data over a constant unstructured grid?  I've written a simple  
unstructured grid algorithm with the animate-able integer value XXX:

int vtkFakeDataAlgo::RequestData(
   vtkInformation *,
   vtkInformationVector **inputVector,
   vtkInformationVector *outputVector)
{
   vtkUnstructuredGrid *in  = GetGrid(inputVector[0]);
   vtkUnstructuredGrid *out = GetGrid(outputVector);

   out->ShallowCopy(in);

   vtkIdType N = out->GetNumberOfPoints();

   vtkFloatArray *data = vtkFloatArray::New();
   data->SetNumberOfComponents(1);
   data->SetNumberOfTuples(N);
   data->SetName( "FakeData" );

   float* ptr = data->GetPointer(0);
   for(vtkIdType ii=0; ii<N; ii++) {
     ptr[(ii+500*XXX)%N] = ii;
   }

   out->GetPointData()->AddArray(data);
   out->GetPointData()->SetActiveAttribute("FakeData",  
vtkDataSetAttributes::SCALARS );
   data->Delete();

   return 1;
}

To test this code, I set up the following pipeline:
  - Read in an unstructured grid
  - Attach this filter

I'm running this code on a ~4 million node mesh I have.   
PVGeometryFilter shows me a progress bar in the bottom every time I  
update XXX.  Due to the size of the mesh, this PVGeometryFilter step  
takes 5-6 seconds, which in turn makes the animation unbearably  
slow.  Is there a better way to write this filter?  I assume that  
PVGeometryFilter is re-calculating the surface of my unstructured  
mesh every time I update XXX.  Is this true?  If so, how can I avoid  
this recalculation?

----

I created this fake algorithm as a test.  I have time varying data on  
a 4 million node mesh and a 33 GBs of time-varying point data.  The  
node locations and connectivity are constant throughout the  
simulation.  I've had two problems visualizing this in Paraview:
  - Based on my understanding of http://paraview.org/Wiki/Talk:VTK/ 
Time_Support, my data set is too large to read in all at once as a  
TemporalDataSet.  Therefore I have to revert to this hacky approach  
in order to add data arrays to a constant mesh.  Did I understand the  
above page correctly?
- Every time I change the data array, Paraview has to think for 5-6  
seconds.  However, I can get real-time visualization if I code things  
by hand using raw vtk.  I hate to roll my own visualization software  
though when Paraview has already coded all the Qt widgets.

Thanks for any guidance you can give me,
Rob

Thank you.  That fixed the problem.  It didn't like my device dimensions.

I am now able to use Delaunay 3d filter and then slice the data.

Is there any way to update the plane of the slice without having to
hit the apply button each time.

Thanks,

Juan

Subject: [Paraview] Using CSV data for 3D volume
Message-ID: <BAY143-W150C8954BC335E7069219D8A350@phx.gbl>


Hello
 
Two queries really.
 
Firstly, how does one get csv data to load in Paraview correctly, for example if it was representing a "data cloud" as XYZ for position and a variable (T) at that point? Is there an example file to test out available?
 
Secondly, and probably links to my previous comment, can a 3D volume be constructed from CSV data so that I can slice the volume, isosurface etc. Example file ?
 
At the moment I am trying to find the easiest method of getting data into Paraview for modelling, with the least effort.
 
All ideas welcome
 
Thanks
 
Lester

Message-ID: <A6644496F8DBED4988A38551147F742F33D3@EXCHANGE.bmt-wbm.local>

Is there a way in 3.2.1 to change the time "tag" mapped to a sequence number so that if you have a legacy vtk series (with default time sequence n=1..N), then Source > Annotate Time will display your tag rather than n?  I tried View > Animation View > Timekeeper - Time with "Variable Time" and:

    Time     Interpolation     Value
1   0        Ramp              4575
2   97                         7000

Is this valid or is there a better way.  Problem here was that when moving frames with the vcr controls, everything but the Annotate Time source text changed - all other display objects remained on n=97.  Is this a bug or am I doing something wrong with animations?

Hi,

 

I've attached a patch to add a zoom box camera manipulator for ParaView
(I didn't know how to put the two new files into the patch file so I've
attached them separately).  This lets the user drag to select a box to
zoom in to.  At the moment it doesn't display the box on the screen as
the mouse is dragged - can anyone help here? 

 

Can this be included in ParaView?

 

Regards,
Paul

Hey Paul,

We'll take a look at it. This is a super useful feature. Do we have
your permission to put this in ParaView after we fix any issues and
make improvements?

No, that is the wrong way to go about it.  Changing the timekeeper time will
adjust the times sent to the reader.  You will still have the mismatch
ParaView will not load in all of the time steps that you want.

Instead, apply the "Temporal Shift Scale" filter to your data to adjust its
range to the desired values.  You will probably also have to change the
animation mode to Sequence to force ParaView to ignore the timesteps
reported from the original reader.

Message-ID: <7f8801500810100919m34752938u63e818ef1e739ea7@mail.gmail.com>

Hello!

I'm trying to extract the data from a line of my 2D dataset, using the
probeline filter. The Z range of my domain is from 0 to 0.

Extracting a line with z1=z2=0, the data at the ends of the line are not
realistic, or rather they remain constant at the ends of the line extracted.
Modifyng the z range of the line (i.e. z1=-0.1 and z2=0.1), tha part of the
line where the data are constant is reduced.

Does someone know how to avoid this problem?

Thanks in advice for ypur attention,

Michele

A basic question. If you generate a slice through a volume, how do you then save the data for that slice as say an x,y,z delimited type file. I tried the save to csv option but the resulting file was empty apart from a header section.

Hello, 

I'm trying to visualise ConeSource() for practice on local host, when i
run this code:

from paraview import servermanager as sm
sm.Connect()
file = "my path to filename"
data = sm.sources.LegacyVTKReader(FileNames=file)
view = sm.CreateRenderView()
rep = sm.CreateRepresentation()
view.StillRender()

everyting is ok, but when I click with my mouse and thus put the vtk
screen to background, the image dissapears, and view.ResetCamera() along
with view.StillRender() can't bring it back. 

Also, I'm trying to render some already filtered data saved as .vtk, and
I repeat the process from above, nothing is shown on the vtk window, not
even after view.ResetCamera() is called.  

Thank You,

Hi Ken,

Ok, I tried that.  I have a N=98 legacy vtk series and want to map the 0->97 time steps to 4575->7000.  So when TemporalShiftScale is applied, from trial and error it seems to m=n*a+m0 where n=1..N, a is the scale, m0 is the shift.  But in the Animation Inspector "Start" is still shown as 0 even though "End" is now 7000 (for any Play Mode) - first problem.  Even so, second problem (same as before) is that when an Annotate Time source text is added, with the Sequence Play Mode, again, moving the animation forward (pressing |> button) increments the time display (i.e. 777.77.., 1555.55..., ... 7000) but keeps the data view on the final data series.  Feels like a bug but maybe I have to set up keyframes.  Normally its all automatic.

If your mesh is constant, you have to cache it in a data member and
shallow copy it to the output and then add the time dependent array.
Because VTK does not separate mesh and field data in its algorithms
(this is almost impossible to do in a general toolkit like VTK), all
filters downstream will re-execute.

I think there is a way of speeding up the geometry filter... Let me
think about it.

OK, I think I know a way that would improve the performance of the
geometry filter for constant mesh and time variant arrays. This would
probably not work with any other filters. This would only make sense
for unstructured grids (or multi-block of unstructured).

Here is what I propose. Hopefully, one of you has the time and the
desire to hack vtkPVGeometryFilter for this.

* First, we need to detect if the input mesh changed. To do this, the
geom. filter needs to store pointers to the previous input cell array
and points. It also has to store their mtimes.

* Second, the geom. filter has to cache the previous output. It has to
do this by shallow copying it to a polydata stored as a data member.
Note that it only needs to store the geometry not the fields. (hint:
use CopyStructure)

* When the geom. filter executes, it can now detect if the input mesh
changed. If it didn't change, simply shallow copy the geometry to the
output. We would be done if we didn't have the arrays.

* The geom. filter also has to cache vtkOriginalPointIds and
vtkOriginalCellIds from the previous execution. These arrays maps the
output points to input points, output cells to input cells. Using
these arrays, the geom. filter has to copy input arrays to output
arrays (hint: Use CopyAllocate and CopyData).

Things are a bit more complicated for multi-block of ugrids but the
same ideas should apply.

I hope this helps. If anyone manages to get this working, I would be
happy to put it in the cvs.

Subject: [Paraview] Data range problem
Message-ID: <BAY143-W23BE5CB020CB056F2CB7B08A370@phx.gbl>


Hello
 
I have just created a test as a set of random values:
 
"x","y","z","grav"0,0,0,20,0,1,30,0,2,50,1,0,-10.1.1,-30,1,2,-50.2.0,10,2,1,20,2,2,51,0,0,-31,0,1,-41,0,2,-11,1,0,01.1.1,-21,1,2,21.2.0,11,2,1-11,2,2,02,0,0,02,0,1-52,0,2,-42,1,0,-12.1.1,12,1,2,22.2.0,52,2,1,42,2,2,4
 
It is a cube of point values (x,y,z) with a test scalar (grav). The data range of "grav" is -5 to +5
 
I imported the data into Paraview as a raw(binary) format file which seemed ok, with the extents:
0 to 2 on (x,y,z). The result was a Image (uniform Rectilinear Grid)
 
When I look at the data information it shows the data range as 2573, 13612 (min,max) - what is going on here?
 
Thanks
 
Lester

You most likely imposed wrong datatype when importing the raw stuff.

Hi Dominik
 
So how can I define the correct datatype? For example, if it is just signed integers like the test I made (-5 to +5), or real numbers (eg -2.54 to 5.55). I set the file to LittleEndian as I'm on a PC
 
Importing the data via the raw format is working, it's just working out the correct type to make it work!
 
Thanks for the help

How do you write the data to a file?

I have asked about internationlization as well.  I got as far as
seeing that the mesh readers would automatically support utf8
encoding, as they are merely strings of 8 bit chars.  It would then
take telling Qt that the strings are the strings are encoded in UTF-8
instead of ascii.

Unfortunately I don't have the time to investigate this further.

I have used a plain text editor to write a simple ascii structure, and also tried using Surfer (Golden Sofware) to prepare .DAT file do the same (eg space delimited or comma delimited). Basically I am testing a simple ascii text file structure and it ckearly loads the data (points plot where they should be), but it is unclear how to set the data type. If we are dealing with positive an negative numbers then I assume that means we need a signed integer or real number type.
 
Perhaps if you could show an example data file that works in the raw import as an xyz,value it might be clearer as to how to proceed. Thanks for the help, I'm sure I'm missing something very obvious here just can't put my finger on it yet!

A simple test you could do is to try to read the raw binary file into matlab. 
there you can also specify both endianness and precision (double, int, etc.). 
I bet the reason you do not get the right numbers is that you import a wrong 
datatype.

Subject: [Paraview] problems with Xdmf-file
Message-ID: <BAY122-W14CD4F4495FF764A892ACBBC360@phx.gbl>


Hi!
I?m trying to write my data in the xdmf-format and read it in paraview. I have a 3D - curvilinear grid, i.e. I have to specify every point with its coordinates and then I have scalar attribute data, to be assigned to each node. 
The .xmf meta-data file is recognised by paraview and works fine, but when I click the "Apply"- button, paraview crashes. I believe that I get the .h5 files wrong, when I write them (as I don?t get the Xdmf-API to work, I writing the .xmf-file "manually" with a program and the .h5-files with the HDF5-API. 
Does anyone know how to set the parameters for writing the correct .h5-file (Rank, and the shape of the array which is written to the file)? 
This is as I have it now:

The coordinate file, which has (in this case) the dimensions 350 140 1. 
I write the coordinates in the following array:
float* Coordinates;
Coordinates = new float [3*xdims];
int j=0; //counter

//write xCoord to array
for(i=0;i<xdims;i=i+3) 
    {Coordinates[i] = xPoints[j];
     j++;
    }
//write yCoord to array
j=0;
for(i=1;i<xdims;i=i+3) 
    {Coordinates[i] = yPoints[j];
     j++;
    }
//write zCoord to array
for(i=2;i<xdims;i=i+3) 
    {Coordinates[i] = 0.0;
    }

This array obviously has rank 1, so I write the .h5 file with the following parameters:

file = H5Fcreate(H5FileName.c_str(), H5F_ACC_TRUNC , H5P_DEFAULT, H5P_DEFAULT);
dataspace = H5Screate_simple(1, dims, NULL);
datatype = H5Tcopy(H5T_NATIVE_FLOAT);
status = H5Tset_order(datatype,H5T_ORDER_LE);
dataset = H5Dcreate2(file,DATASETNAME1,datatype,dataspace,H5P_DEFAULT,H5P_DEFAULT,H5P_DEFAULT);
status = H5Dwrite(dataset, H5T_NATIVE_FLOAT, H5S_ALL, H5S_ALL, H5P_DEFAULT, Coordinates);


The attribute data files I write analogue. 

My .xmf file looks like this:
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<!DOCTYPE Xdmf SYSTEM "Xdmf.dtd" []>

<Xdmf>
<Domain>
<Grid Name="Curvilinear" GridType="Uniform">
<Topology TopologyType="3DSMesh" Dimensions ="350 140 1">

<DataItem DataType="Float" Precision="4" Dimensions="350 140 1"  Format="HDF">

</Geometry>
<Attribute Name="Density" Active="1" Type="Scalar" Center="Node">

Any help would be appreciated!

Subject: [Paraview] Annotate Time with legacy vtk series

As I mentioned before, go to the animation view and change the mode from
"Snap to TimeSteps" to either "Sequence" or "Real Time".  Then change the
start time and end time to the correct values.

The issue you are working around is that ParaView is not smart enough to
determine that you don't really want to see the time steps for the original
data set.  See bug 7799 for more details
(http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=7799).

Subject: [Paraview] avoiding proxy ID collisions
Message-ID: <alpine.DEB.0.82.0810091611030.1886@memphis.cs.utah.edu>

I've written a program which exports ParaView's undo stack as a series of 
vtkUndoSet objects, serialized to XML.  (This is done by calling 
vtkUndoSet::SaveState(), and then calling PrintXML() on the returned 
vtkPVXMLElement object.)  The idea is to be able to import the saved undo 
stack into a blank scene, and step through the stack, "redo"-ing each 
vtkUndoSet.

Although the export works just fine, importing the undo stack is 
more problematic.  The problem is that each vtkSMProxy object has an ID 
number which is guaranteed to be unique during a single ParaView runtime 
session, but which is NOT necessarily unique from one session to another. 
So when I re-run ParaView and import my saved undo stack, occasionally 
the ID numbers for the proxies stored in the XML file will conflict with 
ID numbers already in use by existing vktSMProxy objects.  So when I 
attempt to redo the vtkUndoSets, ParaView pops up an error dialog 
and exits.  (I'm using vtkSMUndoRedoStateLoader::LoadUndoRedoSet() to 
load in the vtkUndoSet objects.)

My question is: Is there a straightforward way to auto-increment the ID 
numbers when loading saved proxy objects, in the case of ID-number 
conflicts?

Thanks,
Geoff

P.S. The specific error message I'm seeing is:
"""
ERROR: In ..\..\..\Servers\Common\vtkProcessModule.cxx, line 1091

Hi Dominik
 
I do not have Matlab to test, but there should be no issue of "endianness" as I work on Windows and use PC-based editors. The file type does not seem to be the issue, but more the data within (just guessing).
 
I have tried all the data type variants without success: other than being able to read the points in.
 
Didn't seem to make much odds using xyzc (0 1 2 3) or (0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0)
 
Do you have an example raw data file?  It would be so much more convenient to be able to load up data via CSV (but that currently doesn't work).
 
What would be the best way of loading data into Paraview that does not require any programming or major work?

Hello,

I have some long file names, which are differentiated by the last few
characters.  Unfortunately, they are impossible to differentiate on
the file open menu.  Likewise field names in the pull down menu can't
easily be distinguished in the last character.

Is there any way I can get paraview to widen the text fields when they
are displayed?

I have a multi-block dataset (vtm referencing vtu files) loaded into
paraview.  Each dataset is a set of points and edges.  For some reason
I can't select triangulate from the filter.  I'd really like to see
the vertex data shaded over the element.

Is there a way to do this?

Sorry for some reason the reply all wasn't working correctly:

I have a whole bunch of files with similar names, and many are being
grouped incorrectly:

gmsh_mos2d_1.0_0.0_0.vtu
gmsh_mos2d_1.0_0.0_1.vtu
gmsh_mos2d_1.0_0.0_2.vtu
gmsh_mos2d_1.0_0.0.vtm
gmsh_mos2d_2.0_0.0_0.vtu
gmsh_mos2d_2.0_0.0_1.vtu
gmsh_mos2d_2.0_0.0_2.vtu
gmsh_mos2d_2.0_0.0.vtm
gmsh_mos2d_2.0_0.4_0.vtu
gmsh_mos2d_2.0_0.4_1.vtu
gmsh_mos2d_2.0_0.4_2.vtu
gmsh_mos2d_2.0_0.4.vtm


Is there any way I can tell it not to attempt to group files?  Is
there any way to tell it not to abbreviate?

Is there anyway to tell it not to widen the tabs and not abbreviate
the fields I wish to "Color By"?

For:
IntrinsicElectrons
IntrinsicCharge
IntrinsicHoles

I am getting:
Intrinsic...(partial)
Intrinsic...(partial)
Intrinsic...(partial)

Thanks,

An updated FindQt4.cmake has been committed to CVS that makes this  
easier.
If you change the qmake pointed to, the includes, libraries, etc...  
are re-found.
So you can change the Qt you're using for your project simply by  
changing the QT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE variable.

Hi, if you have tried all datatypes in Paraview then chances are very high 
your data is not plain raw format but includes some header etc. I don't have 
anything at hand in raw format but would be surprized there is none in VTK 
example data.
PS. I think some little programming might often help you out. You might want 
to look at python if you want to keep it at minimum (plus it integrates with 
VTK and PV).

Hi!
Well, I use paraview 3.3.1 on windows xp. Debugging it with gdb I get the following error:

Program received signal SIGSEV, Segmentation fault.
0x63573e09 in vtkRectilinearGrid::Initialize (this=0xc2b8b90)
at C:/ParaviewSource/ParaView3/VTK/Filtering/vtkRectilinearGrid.cxx:95
95   this -> XCoordinates->UnRegister(this);

Tracing it, the filter is applied three times before I get the segmentation fault above, and I don?t understand why, I thought that once code works, it works forever.. ;-) 
Just for information: My filter is a subclass of vtkRectilinearGridAlgorithm and it subtracts the horizontal average of the point data from the point data, so the structure of the input grid is passed directly to the output and I just do something with the associated point data. 

Does anyone know how to avoid that segmentation fault?
thx,
NH

Hi Domink Sounds like I do't know what the Paraview definition of plain raw format is. I have attached the simple test file - just 3 points with a scalar value.

Well if it has a header then I do not even need to check your file: raw binary 
is raw binary, no headers.

I had a look at your file anyway. You confuse terms: you do not have any raw 
binary file but a plain ASCII text file. If you want to import data this way 
you have to read the vtk format description that is available as a technical 
document on the vtk web page - and modify your input file accordingly.

Lester,

Your best choice is probably going to be VTK ascii format. It is a
very simple format. A uniform rectilinear grid would look like:

# vtk DataFile Version 3.0
vtk output
ASCII
DATASET STRUCTURED_POINTS
DIMENSIONS 3 3 3
SPACING 1 1 1
ORIGIN 0 0 0
POINT_DATA 27
SCALARS RTData float
LOOKUP_TABLE default
60.7635 107.555 80.5241 85.9694 156.706 105.73 37.3531 84.1445 57.1137
100.634 171.37 120.395 149.785 260 169.546 77.2238 147.96 96.9844
60.7635 107.555 80.5241 85.9694 156.706 105.73 37.3531 84.1445 57.1137

A curvilinear grid is easy to write as well. The only additional
information needed is the point coordinates.

More detail can be found here: http://vtk.org/pdf/file-formats.pdf

I am not sure I understand what you are trying to do. You are trying
to create tetrahedras given a set of points?

For the 3d case, I was told by a member of the list to use the
tetrahedralize filter in order to be able to project my point and edge
data to tetrahedral volumes.

I am now trying to extend this to the 2d case.

I assumed that having data in a plane, that I could just apply a
triangulate filter, which was not possible to select.

Through my own experimentation, I have found the Delaunay 2d filter
works appropriately for interpolating the point data onto triangular
shapes.

Regards,

Juan

Are you entering this from the GUI python shell or from a stand-alone
python session? Which platform are you on?

Yup, Delaunay 2d is what you want. Triangle filter break other polygon
types (quads for example) into triangles. It cannot construct
triangles from points.

Hi Berk
 
Thanks for the suggestion. Would I be right in saying that the data in the lookup table part have to be in a specific format i.e. 3 rows of 9 floats in your example? Is there a rule of thumb about the layout of the lookout table?
 
I think the file format is fine for smallish data volumes but could be a lot of work if it's a large dataset. Any possibility that a future release will allow the user to load a CSV spreadsheet file and generate data volumes directly ?
 
Thanks
 
Lester

In ParaView CVS there is an experimental CSV reader. You might want to  
give that a try.

Trying to get your data into ParaView can run the gamut of easy to  
difficult. It all depends on what type of data you have...

Is it a structured grid on data at regular intervals with a scalar  
value at each point?
Is is a free form cloud of points defined by X,Y,Z coordinates with a  
scalar value at each point?
Is it on a semi-regular grid?

The ascii files are easy to write and human readable so they serve a  
nice purpose to help people get their data into ParaView quickly. How  
large then can get depends on your data. I have a few data files that  
are a couple of hundred megabytes in vtk ascii format but they do load.

The last resort (or first for some) is to just write a custom reader  
plugin for your data. There are also other formats that might be  
available to your experiments such as Xdmf (xml + hdf5) that might be   
usable. That format has the advantage that you probably do NOT need to  
bring all of VTK/ParaView into your experimental code.

Just keep asking questions and the community will try to help as best  
we can.

Message-ID: <c6b291250810142114r4f88152esc71945b153d79ed0@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

How might I retrieve VTK data through the python shell for cells selected
using the selection tools in the GUI?
I would like to run some functions on the points that make up a selected
cell.
Do I need to register a new proxy of some sort?

Thanks for your help,
Steve

Natalie,

It might be that :
	1. Your dimensions should be "1 140 350" (KJI) not "350 140 1"
	dimensions are listed with the slowest changing dimension first.
	We will be adding a flag to the XML to allow for this later.

	2. If you are using GeometryType="XYZ" then there are 3
	values for each node. So your DataItem dimensions should
	be "1 140 350 3".

If your first dimension is always going to be "1" then you might want to
use 2DSMesh instead.

Here is an example of a 3DSMesh of a single plane. 3 rows of 4 columns.

Subject: [Paraview] pvsc server config file string substitution syntax
	(paraview 3.2.3)
Message-ID: <1224081975.24928.4.camel@iceboat.crrel.usace.army.mil>

I am trying to port a windows pvsc server configuration file to linux
and run into trouble when defining an argument value that contains
several variables:

I first define variables using:
       <Option name="SYS1" label="node1">
          <Boolean true="node1," false="," default="true" />
        </Option>
        <Option name="SYS2" label="node2">
          <Boolean true="node2," false="," default="false" />
        </Option>

and want to construct the execution-command as:
     <Command exec="ssh" delay="5">
        <Arguments>
         <Argument value="mpirun" />
         <Argument value="--host" />
         <Argument value="$SYS1$$SYS2$/>         
        </Arguments>
      </Command>

all works fine when using just
         <Argument value="$SYS1$/>

but the multiple variable substitution seems not to work. It looks to me
as if the system tries to substitute the whole string 
"SYS1$$SYS2" instead of "SYS1" and "SYS2"

Note that the script works for a windows client, replacing all the $
with %. 

I am using paraview 3.2.3.

any hints or help appreciated. 

regards,
Thomas Kaempfer

Subject: [Paraview] How to lunch a python script at paraview client start ?
Message-ID: <B4FE4FC5D1514B869E89004ABC0E68AF@dcgh>

Hello,

I want to use paraview client/server mode and on the client side, I execute a python script which drives paraview server and
paraview client visualization.

Is it possible to give the name of the python script as an argument of the paraview command line, rather than opening python shell
and loading the py file via the browser file ?

Unfortunately not. It should be relatively easy to add. Can you file a
feature request at http://paraview.org/Bug

Is there a way to drive a filter from two inputs?  I'd like to derive a
planar equation from one filter and use it to specify a cut plane slicing a
the result from a different filter.  Any pointers?

Hi,

I have a 220 MB vtu file that is being loaded and it is taking at
least 15 min to load the data.  Is there any option to reduce the
amount of time paraview would take to load the data.  Or is there some
way I should be formatting my data.  The vtu file is in the ASCII XML
VTK format.

Thanks,

Juan

Yes it did.  I don't understand why an option like this would have an
effect, but it loaded significantly faster.  The CellDataToPointData
filter ran incredibly fast as well.

What does this option mean for loading files?

Thanks,

Juan

Whoops.  It didn't really help.  I had loaded a much smaller dataset
by accident.  The large dataset still has problems.

ASCII XML is very slow to load because it uses the XML parser. For
large data, you should switch to a binary format.

XML binary
legacy VTK
Exodus
Xdmf

are a few choices.

To see the difference in load time, save the data out as a binary vtu
or vtk file and load it back in.

Hello,

Thanks for the suggestion.  I assume that for double precision I am
doing a base64 encoding for every number in the list?  Is compression
worthwhile for floating point data?  Are there free compression
libraries out there?

situation is similar as with compressing images: depends.

you may want to look at hdf5, which offers zlib based compression

Use Binary for a file that large. When you use XML you have the  
following overhead:

XML Parser.
Decompress the data
Decode the Base 64 into something readable

If you save it as a binary file you have the following overhead.

Read the data directly into a memory location.
Possibly byte swap the values (big endian to little endian)..

Use binary. Way faster.

There's a "Kitware System Library" (KWSYS) inside ParaView distribution 
that could help you in writing Base64 coded strings. Take a look in 
PV3ROOT/VTK/Utilities/kwsys/ . Other good option would be using 
HDF5/Xdmf format. It's not so hard to understand and implement as well.

Renato.

There is no requirement for encoding or compression in the XML format.
It is an option. You can have appended binary data that is pure raw. I
do not use compression or encoding in my files.

By the way, if you are willing to link against the VTK libraries, VTK
has a C/Fortran interface to write XML files.

I have a vector of N points.  So the number of doubles in 3*N.  A
double is 8 long.  Base 64 produces 4/3 the number of original bytes.

As expected my base64 string is 3*N*8 * (4/3)

So for 1417 points, I should expect a string 45344 characters long.

Paraview claims my string is too short:
ERROR: In /home/jsanchez/ParaView3/VTK/IO/vtkXMLUnstructuredDataReader.cxx,
line 522
vtkXMLUnstructuredGridReader (0x4dde7e0): Cannot read points array
from Points in piece 0.  The data array in the element may be too
short.

Here is the header I am writing:
<UnstructuredGrid>
<Piece NumberOfPoints="1417" NumberOfCells="8781">
<Points>
<DataArray type="Float64" NumberOfComponents="3" format="binary">
this is where my raw base64 encoding string goes
</DataArray>
</Points>

What could be wrong with my string of characters?

Thanks,

Juan

from the paraview gui is always builtin::0


Also,
Is there a way to search the listserve archive? I can't seem to find a link
for this.





thank you,

I ended up having to reverse engineer the file format.  Apparently
compression is required, and I had to reverse engineer the paraview
code to determine how to write the "header".  Apparently the zlib
compression is performed on blocks of 32768 bytes, and a header must
be written to separate them back out on read.

As I said earlier compression and encoding are not required.

You can't connect to the paraview gui. You can only connect to
instances of pvserver. Currently, those accept one connection only. We
will be working on collaboration support that will enable both of the
above.

There is an archive:
http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/
and you can search it using google if you did
site:http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/ <search terms here>

Alternatively, you can use MarkMail: http://markmail.org
use
list:org.paraview.paraview <search terms here>

The MarkMail interface is excellent.

Message-ID: <fd5546a50810160822o7b242a67s64c8cda859e44a19@mail.gmail.com>

Hello All,
I have an Exodus II file that has 3D temporal information stored. I am
interested in taking a slice of the 3D data, transforming it to a different
orientation, and then comparing it with 2D data from an analytical solution
(also stored in an Exodus II file). I can't seem to get the calculator to
work, I've tried two calculators to rename the variables and then another
one to substract the two, but I am in no luck. I was going to try to save
data from Paraview into an intermediary format, that perhaps would be better
understood by the calculator. Any ideas?

Thanks,

Alessandro

Hello,

It appears to me that base64 encoding is necessary if you want the
file to be easily looked at in a texteditor, and to remove data easily
from the file.

Base64 encoding seems necessary to have the data in a normal section
and in not some huge block at the end of the file.

According, to:
http://www.geophysik.uni-muenchen.de/intranet/it-service/applications/paraview/vtk-file-formats/

an encoding appears to be required in order to have a valid xml file.

Rewriting my VTK file writer to use offsets into a raw array would
have taken much longer than trying to understand how to use the Base64
encoding and Zlib compression.

Please stipulate in your Wiki that the default block size for the
paraview writer is 32768 bytes.

Regards,

Juan

You can use the Append Attributes filter to merge the fields of two or more
data sets into one (assuming they have the same topology), and then run the
calculator on that.

Subject: [Paraview] python and ctags/etags
Message-ID: <alpine.LRH.2.00.0810161752450.18108@DIPWS019>


what is the proper/best way to find the source code for methods in defined
in python modules?


for example


dir(servermanager.sources)


gives a method


  AVSucdReader



However,
a ctags database has no entry for "AVSucdReader" ?


Furthermore,
Are there any design patterns implemented that indicate whether
a function being called in python is a C++ function -OR- another 
python function?







thank you,
David Fuentes

I think this int needs to be unsigned (or more bits).....

1727      // Next: allocate a new array if necessary.

1728      if (this->FastGeomQuadArrays[this->NextArrayIndex] == NULL)

1729        {

1730        this->FastGeomQuadArrays[this->NextArrayIndex] 

1731          = new unsigned char[this->FastGeomQuadArrayLength];

1732        }

1733      

1734      vtkFastGeomQuad* q = reinterpret_cast<vtkFastGeomQuad*>

1735        (this->FastGeomQuadArrays[this->NextArrayIndex] +
this->NextQuadIndex);

1736      q->numPts = numPts;

1737

1738      this->NextQuadIndex += polySize;

1739

(gdb) print this->FastGeomQuadArrayLength

$2 = -1721647736

(gdb) whatis this->FastGeomQuadArrayLength 

type = int

(gdb)

 

More than just that variable needs to be updated though.

 

I experienced this when viewing the surface of a mesh with 90M cells on
a single machine.  Cuts worked without any problems.

Many thanks. Looks like I should have different name for the variables.
Initially I had a same variable name in two data files. I could see only
only one variable name under scalar field. After using different names I
could see two variable names.

Nice weekend,
Hom Nath

Another option is the python programmable filter. It isn't as
intuitive to use (unless you are familiar with python wrapped vtk
programming), but unlike the calculator filter it will accept multiple
inputs, is likely to execute faster, and you don't need to worry about
array name collision.

Subject: [Paraview] ANNOUNCE: ParaView 3.4.0 released
Message-ID: <45d654b0810170757n7240ec6cv427bfbea841e0059@mail.gmail.com>

The ParaView 3.4 release is now available for download from the
ParaView web site (http://paraview.org). It is also available through
CVS; the tag is ParaView-3-4-0. Since the 3.2 release, we have been
focusing on usability and 3.4 contains many improvements and bug
fixes.

The major changes since 3.4 are:
* VTK and ParaView are now licensed under the BSD license as opposed
to modified BSD.
* The multi*block and AMR support was improved significantly. Almost
all filters, spreadsheet view and charts now support these datasets.
* The selection capabilities of ParaView were significantly improved.
For details, see Kitware Source, issue 6 or
http://paraview.org/Wiki/Data_Selection.
* Some of other improvements and fixes are

New features

* Added support for plotting multiple point/cell values over time.
* Save screenshot now allows saving of all views.
* It is not possible to save higher resolution screenshots.
* Added support for picking end*points of lines widgets (used in plot
over line and streamlines) using 'p'.
* Added support for scene exporters. Supported formats are X3D (binary
and ascii), VRML 2 and POV (Persistence of Vision Raytracer).
* Added ability to open multiple CTH and Exodus restart files.
* Added temporal statistics filter that can be used to find average,
min, max and standard deviation of arrays over time.
* Added support for choosing (picking) custom center of rotation.
* Added volume rendering support for multi*block datasets. The user
now chooses which block to volume render.
* Added filter to append all blocks of a multi*block dataset to one
unstructured grid. Can be used to volume render the whole multi*block
dataset.
* Added support to color by block.
* Added 2D views / slice representation for volumes (vtkImageData).
* Added box and sphere widgets for slicing and clipping.
* Added cube axes that can be used to show scale of a dataset.
* Added support to color by AMR level.
* Added support to turn on/off the visibility of multiple objects.
Select multiple objects in the pipeline browser and click on one of
the eyeballs.
* Added multiple selection using ctrl (command on Mac). When
performing selection after the first time, hold ctrl to add to the
existing selection.
* Added "Normal Glyphs" custom filter.
* Added "zoom" to individual arrays in the spreadsheet view.
Double*click on the title*bar to activate/deactivate.
* Added support for displaying textures on polygonal data.

Improvements to Existing Features

* Plugin improvements. See the plugin page on the wiki for more
information. http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Plugin_HowTo
* Added option to disable offscreen rendering while saving images.
This option should be turned on if ParaView crashes when saving
images. This is to get around an OpenGL bug that is on some Linux
Intel drivers.
* Added option to disable depth peeling when rendering translucent
geometry. Some graphics card drivers claim to support everything that
is needed for depth peeling while not implementing them. If you are
experience crashes when transparency is on, disable depth peeling.
* Added easily accessible menu to select the component of a vector to color by.
* Added support for plotting more than one component of a vector on
the same chart.
* Plot over line now works with multi*block and AMR data.
* CTH reader now combines X, Y and Z velocity components into a vector.
* Added button to rescale to data range in bar charts.
* Changed the default width of the scalar bar to a more reasonable
size. Also tweaked the way scalar bar scaling works.
* Improved partial array support (when an array exists only in some of
the blocks of a multi*block dataset).
* Added selection support for composite datasets.
* Added chooser for unstructured volume rendering algorithm.
* Added support for selecting array in gradient filter for image data.
Removed gradient magnitude. Use gradient + array calculator.
* Many comparative view fixes.
* Many tiled*display fixes.
* Many widgets used a few digit precision for floating point numbers
making it impossible to use higher precision. Fixed.

Reader and Writer Improvements

* Added readers for MFIX and Fluent files to the GUI.
* Added support for loading file series from the command line as well
as from the recent file menu.
* Added SILO reader. Needs more work.
* Added support to save multi*block polygonal datasets as a collection
of STL or PLY files.
* Added support for file series of XML based VTK files.
* Updated XDMF reader to XDMF 2.

Bug Fixes

* Point coordinates were not shown in the spreadsheet view if there
were no point arrays. Fixed.
* Calculator function was not reloaded with state. Fixed.
* Annotation text was not scaling properly when rendering
high*resolution animations/images. Fixed.
* Color by menu was not updated in some cases. Fixed.
* CTH reader was not handling missing files gracefully. Fixed.
* Selection inspector could not display labels for global element ids. Fixed.
* Loading state reseted to time step 0, fixed.
* Pipeline was not always updating when time was shifted. Fixed.
* Fixed crash when using  Edit *> Delete All.
* Fixed installation with VTK_USE_RPATH on.
* Selection did not work in parallel if compositing was off. Fixed.
* Selection labels were not updated during animation. Fixed.
* Several undo/redo fixes.

Hi folks,

We have been working hard on updating paraview.org and the ParaView
wiki. The wiki content has grown significantly in the last month or
so. We are also looking for volunteers who are interested in
contributing.

By the way, the next generation of the array calculator will support
multiple inputs.

Sounds Great!
Can you point us to documentation on XML vtk file format changes  
related to file series?

* Added support for file series of XML based VTK files.

Thanks

Dan

Subject: [Paraview] hidden python methods??
Message-ID: <alpine.LRH.2.00.0810171108240.25166@DIPWS019>

working through one of the examples on the wiki

http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Python_Scripting#Animating


   reader = sources.ExodusIIReader(?.../can.ex2?)
     .
     .
     .
   reader.UpdatePipelineInformation()

However

   dir(reader)


does Not return a method by the name of "UpdatePipelineInformation"
However, the call still works??

How are you able to call a method that is not returned by dir()?
Are there any python debuggers available that will let you step
into the function reader.UpdatePipelineInformation()
to see what is actually being called?






thank you,
df

It is magic :-)

Actually, it is a common python design pattern. Most of the classes in
the servermanager module are wrappers around low-level classes
provided by the paraview server manager C++ library. In python, you
can define a method (__getattr__) that gets called whenever a symbol
cannot be resolved. This allows python classes to delegate
functionality to other classes. In your case, the reader object has a
member called SMProxy that it is delegating to. If you do
dir(reader.SMProxy)
you can the list of all available functions.

Property objects do the same thing. They delegate to a SMProperty member.

It is not a format change. It is now possible to load file series of
xml files. For example, if you have

foo_0.vtu
foo_1.vtu
...

you can open them as a group and animate through the series. Were you
looking for something else?

The servermanager module dynamically creates bunch of classes at
run-time, including AVSucdReader. Programs that search through the
source code can't access any of those classes. To get information
about a particular class, you should do
help(servermanager.sources.<classname>)
I believe there is a way of generating html out of that help but I
don't know how.

Are the connectivity of these two meshes the same? If not, you have to
map values of one mesh to another. If you give me some sample data to
play with, I can tell you what pipeline you will need.

Subject: [Paraview] python to change reader filename and animate AVS files
Message-ID: <alpine.LRH.2.00.0810171137220.25166@DIPWS019>




Not sure if the AVS file reader is "time aware" but,
using the python interface it seems possible to write a script
to animate a time series of AVS files.  Changing the reader 
filename via the python interface seems to work:


   pm=servermanager.ProxyManager()
   femdata = pm.GetProxy("sources","femdata")
   femdata.SetPropertyWithName("FileName",".../new_filename.inp")



To create an animation would probably have to update various
other objects attached to the reader though.
How could you determine all objects attached to the reader
that need to be updated?


using paraview 3.2.1,

What you need is something like:

pm=servermanager.ProxyManager()
femdata = pm.GetProxy("sources","femdata")
for i in range(10):
 femdata.FileName = "foo%d.inp" % i
 servermanager.GetRenderView().StillRender()

ParaView takes care of updating other objects for you. If you want to
learn more, I suggest searching for "demand driven pipeline". The VTK
book is a good source of information.

Hi,

I have to say I'm really happy to finally see a 64 bit package
for Paraview. Thanks for this!

I've just installed it and I have one little thing
to point out: the default location for installation is in 
Program Files (x86) instead of Program Files. The installed
paraview.exe is actually a 64-bit process, but your installer
package runs as a 32-bit process. My vague recollection is
that the default location is chosen according to the process 
type of the installer package unless you hardwire it in
somehow.

Thanks again,
Jon.

   reader = sources.ExodusIIReader(?.../can.ex2?)
     .
     .
     .
   reader.UpdatePipelineInformation()

However

   dir(reader)


does Not return a method by the name of "UpdatePipelineInformation"
However, the call still works??

How are you able to call a method that is not returned by dir()?
Are there any python debuggers available that will let you step
into the function reader.UpdatePipelineInformation()
to see what is actually being called?






thank you,

It is magic :-)

Actually, it is a common python design pattern. Most of the classes in
the servermanager module are wrappers around low-level classes
provided by the paraview server manager C++ library. In python, you
can define a method (__getattr__) that gets called whenever a symbol
cannot be resolved. This allows python classes to delegate
functionality to other classes. In your case, the reader object has a
member called SMProxy that it is delegating to. If you do
dir(reader.SMProxy)
you can the list of all available functions.

Property objects do the same thing. They delegate to a SMProperty
member.

It is not a format change. It is now possible to load file series of
xml files. For example, if you have

foo_0.vtu
foo_1.vtu
...

you can open them as a group and animate through the series. Were you
looking for something else?

ok, Now I understand.
I thought that time step information had been rolled into the xml file  
(.vtu.vtp..)
Currently I embe the time step line, that will be used in a pvd file,  
in my .vtu files
as a comment line. I then use a little shell script to build a pvd for  
all .vtu files in a
given directory. This works fine, I just thought there might now be a  
more standard way to do it.
It's low priority for me, but it does seem like adding a standard XML  
tag for time into XML vtk files
would be good. Then when the time aware reader reads in the file  
series to animate, it would have access to the
time associated with each file.

Can you return control to the GUI during the execution of the python script?
During the loop I want to enable GUI interaction w/ the view,
i.e. use mouse to rotate/translate/etc...
but ParaView will not let me move/rotate until After the script is 
complete.

Hmmm. I think that may be a performance issue. If the pvd file does
not contain the time values, the reader would have to open all of the
files in order to get that information.

I think there is a temporal statistics filter. That should do what you want...

Nope. Python interface gives you the flexibility to change filenames.
We assume that if you are using Python, you know what you are doing
and you will not change the datatype during the iteration. Also, the
FAQ is out-of-date. I will start rewriting it very soon.

I am afraid you cannot. I think it is a good idea though. You may want
to consider filing a feature request here: http://paraview.org/Bug

This issue...http://public.kitware.com/Bug/view.php?id=6363

...covers CPack created packages for Win64 defaulting to the wrong "Program
Files" directory. After that bug is fixed, and the next ParaView Win64
installer is built with a fixed version of CPack, ParaView's installer
should automatically choose the correct default.

For now, just make sure you put it in "C:\Program Files" so nobody gets
confused. It should still work from the "C:\Program Files (x86)" directory,
it's just violating the convention and has the same default location that
the 32-bit ParaView has... so if you install both, put the 32-bit one in the
"(x86)" folder, and the 64-bit one in the regular folder.


HTH,
David

Subject: [Paraview] show axis with values
Message-ID: <48F9B260.7030603@gmail.com>

Hi
I want to have the axis with values on my plot. by default, only the 
origin and the axis with labels are shown. in other word, i want the 
plot is limited to a cube (in 3d) with values on 3 edges.
is there any option to active this?

Subject: [Paraview] QT Assistant Glob
Message-ID: <200810180715.52327.hobbsk@ohiou.edu>

For a few days now both of my workstations have failed to build ParaView for 
the dashboard. The hosts are gargon.hooperlab and murron.hobbs-hancock. 

The error is:

CMake Error at Applications/Client/CMakeLists.txt:506 (FILE):
  file GLOB requires a glob expression after the directory

There were warnings about the Qt version 4.4.1, but I installed and set CMake 
to use version 4.3.5.

There are also warnings that the Qt assistant library is not found.

Anybody know what's wrong?

No it would not be. Server manager and the underlying rendering code
in VTK are not even close to being thread safe. What you are
suggesting would open a can of worms that would take man-months to
fix. I can't remember what the problem with the threads is but I am
glad it does not work :-)

Thanks for the heads up on that, so I should not use threads inside pvpython
than?

Subject: [Paraview] Extension of Deadline (31st of October) OSEHC2009 Open
 source workshop in conjunction with BIOSTEC2009 and call for participation
Message-ID: <48FB82BF.9050307@it-science-center.de>

Dear open source in healthcare user/developer,

Sorry for contacting you again. We would like to inform you that the 
deadline for submitting papers for the OSEHC2009 workshop was extended 
until 31st of October. We welcome papers in all areas of open source in 
health care including position papers. For your convenience we have 
attached the original CfP below.
The aim of the workshop is to provide a meetingplace for developers and 
users of open source products in health care. The workshop will be 
conzeptualized as an event that allows the active participation of the 
delegates. By submitting a paper you additionally have the opportunity 
to promote your open source product and let the audience participate in 
your experience in the open source in health care sector.
If your not able to submit a paper due to the short time frame you may 
profit from the workshop by actively participating in the discussion 
sessions and the market place for devfelopers/users that we are planing 
for the workshop. Please help us in promoting the workshop in your 
community.

Hope to see you all in Porto in January 2009.
Best regards,
Thomas Karopka
(OSHEC 2009 workshop chair)

Subject: [Paraview] Devel CMake does not configure PV on linux
Message-ID: <1224518094.14481.21.camel@gargon.hooperlab>

All of my ParaView dashboards have been failing to configure. I just
noticed that there are only 5 submissions that use the development
version of CMake. 4 of those are on linux and fail to configure PV with
the same error:
	CMake Error at Applications/Client/CMakeLists.txt:506 (FILE):
	  file GLOB requires a glob expression after the directory

3 of the 4 are mine.

PV Configured fine with a cmake-2.6.1 build that I have sitting around on gargon.

What is QT_LIB_DIR_tmp on your machine?
MESSAGE(STATUS "QT_LIB_DIR_tmp='${QT_LIB_DIR_tmp}'")

I'm betting it's empty based on your problem. (And not for anybody else...)

So: why is it empty for you, but not for most?

Looks like it's empty the last time through with the devel cmake.

DASH5.kitware also has this issue. It is the only linux build, other
than mine, that uses the devel version of CMake.

Its fixed in CVS CMake now.  Its a regression that appeared when modifying 
FindQt4.cmake to support re-finding Qt when changing the qmake pointed to.

Thank you! I am now able to build with the development version of cmake.
gargon's dashboard should be nearly fine and murron's should be back to

All:

Does anyone know who is the owner of the ParaView tutorial datasets for 
SuperComputing 07? Is that possible for us to use it in some of 
technique show such as the next SuperComputing?  If so, who are the 
right person/group we should give the credits to?

Or does any one have a dataset which is suitable for a 3-pipe parallel 
rendering with ParaView to show the scalability?

Thanks in advance.

Message-ID: <BAY102-W92F4D1184E08DDCF3F937AB2E0@phx.gbl>


Hi,
 
My name is chewping and I?m doing my master?s research in the University of Malaya, Malaysia. I?m using ParaView and MPI to visualize a relatively large medical data set in a homogeneous cluster environment. It consists of one master node and 9 slave nodes in a Local Area Network with class C IP address. Most nodes are similar to each other (32 bits processor, running on Linux). I would like to manipulate MPI to make the performance better (faster distributions of data and collections of results). As I am new to MPI and parallel processing system, there are a few questions that I would like to ask:
 
1.      How MPI distribute the work load?
2.      Does the master node divide the work load evenly first, then distribute to each slave node?
3.      Or the master node pass the whole chunk of work load to every slave node, then the slave node ?take? their own piece of work to process?
4.      Can the work load being distributed according to priority (load balancing)? Or give a bigger portion of work load to the better performance node?
 
Can MPI do the above and how? Where can I learn more on how to use MPI to tune for peak performance for distribution processing?
 
Thanks in advance for your feedback!

Hi Qinghuai,

Those are all datasets made public by Sandia. You can definitely use
them in your demos. I have some larger datasets that you can use in
parallel. Can you describe how you configured the pipes? As 3
different displays? Also, when will you be presenting? I would like to
stop by....

Chewping,

I recommend reading the section on "Visualizing Large Models" in our
Supercomputing 2008 tutorial handouts (available from
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/SC08_ParaView_Tutorial), or better yet attend
the tutorial in a few weeks.

I also provide terse answers to your questions below.


> 1.      How MPI distribute the work load?

The reader units each read in part of the data in the file(s).

The master node never touches the data.

> 3.      Or the master node pass the whole chunk of work load to every slave

The server nodes (what you call slaves) each take their own piece by
directly reading it from the file.

There is no facility for that right now in ParaView.  In my experience, the
benefits you gain are seldom worth the effort in either development or added
overhead in computing and redistributing the data balance.  You are welcome
to try though.

So what are the exact terms of the license now? I haven't observed any
changes in it in the binary distribution or on the web page.

Hey Folks,

I'm programming a filter, and I would like to be able to call automatically a writer(which I have also programmed), as the user hits a specific PushButton in the ObjectPanel.I mean: I want to have a SAVE button, and as the user hits it, it should save the model in my own format. How can I do this ?

Thanks,

Now that I read this again, I am unsure if you are speaking directly of the
native VTK .vtu files (or perhaps legacy .vtk files) or if you are asking
generally about the file formats that ParaView supports.  I will answer
both.

The native VTK unstructured grid files do not directly support data that
changes over time.  However, you can write out each time step in its own
file them sequentially (e.g. file0.vtu, file1.vtu, file2.vtu, ...).
ParaView will recognize this as a file series and read it as data that
changes over time.

There are some other formats read by ParaView that directly support
unstructured data that changes over time.  The Exodus and EnSight data
formats are both examples.

Ah, I see, thanks a lot for the clarification. I thought that "BSD
license" means the original license (with the advertisement clause)

Control-C

seems to be disabled in the GUI python shell?


Tools -> Python Shell

execfile("script.py")



Control-C  doesn't seems to be able to interrupt the script execution?
When looping through time instances I want to stop the script
at a given time.  Is there a method to interrupt the script execution?



thanks,
df

Subject: [Paraview] Compile Error with 3.4.0 Release
Message-ID: <898D7448-E745-4BC6-A39E-63FF1FD202AE@bluequartz.net>

I just downloaded the source code to ParaView 3.4.0 and tried to  
compile. I get the following error:

Linking CXX shared library ../../bin/libpqComponents.dylib
Undefined symbols:
   "QAssistantClient::QAssistantClient(QString const&, QObject*)",  
referenced from:
       pqClientMainWindow::makeAssistant()       in pqClientMainWindow.o
   "QAssistantClient::setArguments(QStringList const&)", referenced  
from:
       pqClientMainWindow::makeAssistant()       in pqClientMainWindow.o
ld: symbol(s) not found

make[2]: *** [bin/libpqComponents.dylib] Error 1
make[1]: *** [Qt/Components/CMakeFiles/pqComponents.dir/all] Error 2
make: *** [all] Error 2


As usual I ignored the warning about my Qt version. I have 4.4.2 and  
CMake complains that I should have 4.3.x. I thought ParaView 3.4.0 was  
going to require Qt 4.4 this time around? Is that my problem or is it  
something else entirely.

Here is the run of CMake:

The "Qt QTASSISTANT library not found." warning is a bit alarming.. I  
have never had that fail.

This is also with CMake CVS...

Update your CMake.  There was a bug in CVS CMake for a few days.

Hello,

With the servermanager.py python module we can easily 
manipulate the servermanager as described in the document 
servermanager2.pdf
I am looking for some documentation on how to use Pq and 
vtk servermanager classes to do what we can do with the 
servermanager.py module using C++.
Is the new Paraview guide contain something about it?
Do you know where can I find any examples or 
documentation?
(I'm not talking about the classes documentation, but 
about how to use this classes together to load the 
servermanager and manipulate object, view, state,camera 
...)

Thank you

Message-ID: <BAY143-W8D67929067C2F3F45712A8A280@phx.gbl>


Hello
 
I have installed the new version 3.4.0 on Windows and it works fine. However, I cannot see where the new readers are that you quote:
 
Reader and Writer Improvements* Added readers for MFIX and Fluent files to the GUI.* Added support for loading file series from the command line as wellas from the recent file menu.* Added SILO reader. Needs more work.* Added support to save multi*block polygonal datasets as a collectionof STL or PLY files.* Added support for file series of XML based VTK files.* Updated XDMF reader to XDMF 2.
There was no option for the SILO format when using the File/Open route, and when I tried a few SILO files (from VisIT 1.10) it would not recognise them in any way - a bug?
 
I would still like to see full support for loading netCDF grid files, either as single 2D grids to build a 3D volume or as the 3DnetCDF structure.
 
I know that there is some work on taking data in XYZ,var1,var2 etc, tabulated (CSV) format in and building a volume, but here again this is an area that would be of great use. Hopefully this will eventually get into a future release, for those of usd that do not build and compile the source code. 
 
Thanks
 
Lester

Hey Rafael,

First, you'll have to add a property to your filter to call the method 
that requests the writing as follows:

<SourceProxy name="MyFilter" class="vtkMyFilter">
   ...
   <Property name="Save"
	    command="Save" />
   ...
</SourceProxy>

Then you have to create a custom object panel (look at the wiki for 
plugin examples) which adds a button and then a callback  to do 
something as follows:

void pqMyPanel::callback()
{
   this->proxy()->InvokeCommand("Save");
}

Hi Lester,

Someone correct me if I am wrong, but I believe due to licensing
issues the binary distribution of ParaView does not include the Silo
reader.  If you download the 3.4 source distribution you can compile
paraview with the Silo reader enabled if your system has silo
development libraries installed.

That typically happens if you run your app with an older Qt version than the 
one you compiled the app with.

In Visual Studio, you can look in the output window to see which dll's it 
picks up at runtime.  Or you can check your PATH environment variable.

Hi Pat
 
Sounds somewhat confusing. If the program is advertised as having a reader for SILO files it should be more clearly stated that it is only available if you compile the code yourself - I only use the binary windows distribution.
 
Hopefully more file formats will be available, in the binary (windows) distribution at a future release.
 
Thanks for the clarrification

Subject: [Paraview] Empty Lines in Screenshot
Message-ID: <1224797783.25677.9.camel@gargon.hooperlab>

I'm seeing empty lines in large screenshots. 

I've placed an example at:
http://crab-lab.zool.ohiou.edu/kevin/empty_lines.png

The lines aren't really empty they just have the background color.

It seems to only happen when volume rendering.

It seems to only happen when the snapshot is bigger than the render
window.

I can move the empty lines around by changing the size of the render
window.

This computer runs Fedora 8 x86_64.

ParaView is from a nightly CVS build.

Mesa is from a nightly git build.

Sorry, my bad. Silo is not open source. It has the following condition:

                                               NOTIFICATION OF COMMERCIAL USE


Commercialization of this product is prohibited without notifying the
Department of Energy (DOE) or Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL).

This is the reason why we can't include it in the binary release. I
would also caution anyone using the Silo library in commercial
settings because of this. I will change the release notes.

Subject: [Paraview] Starting paraview with --server option
Message-ID: <E3ABA3C2B68C435FA1481525F07DC886@dcgh>

Hello,

I need to start Paraview with connexion to pvserver 3.4.0 on port 11111 on Windows XP SP3 .

I start pvserver in a command shell.

I start paraview 3.4.0 in another shell with the following syntax.
   paraview --server="localhost"
   paraview --server="127.0.0.1"
   paraview --server="127.0.0.1:11111"
   paraview --server="cs://localhost:11111"


I got always a message of this type :
     Could not connect to requested server " xxxxxx ". Creating default builtin connection
     where xxxxx is the string given after --server=

What is the right syntax ?

Thanks
Guy

Hi!
Well, Paraview still crashes when I try to read an .xmf file. That?s what it looks like now: 

<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<!DOCTYPE Xdmf SYSTEM "Xdmf.dtd" []>
<Xdmf>

                 </DataItem>
              </Attribute>
        </Grid>
   </Domain>
</Xdmf>


Well, Paraview obviously reads my .xmf file as I see my Grid and the associated attribute data in the object inspector in paraview. 
When I click the "Apply" button, I get and output message from paraview which says that there has been caught an exception of a qt-eventhandler.?! 
Debugging, I get the error "Access violation". 

Concerning my .h5 file, it looks ok, i.e I have my group "Curvilinear" which is my grid and then two datasets associated with it, "Coordinates" and "dg". 
Coordinates is a 2D-array with dimensions 49000x2, i.e. in the first column is the xCoordinate, in the second the yCoordinate. 
dg is a 350x140 array with the densitiy values associated with each node. 

I believe that I set the dimensions wrong in my .xmf file, but I don?t know how to set it right! I have a 2D-mesh, specifying every point with coordinates and I have attribute data associated with each node. 

thx for help,
NH

Hi Natalie.
I too had some difficulties when I was getting started with xmdf.  I had similar problems of paraview crashing a lot when I was first migrating my data over to the format.  I found this crashing behaviour was due to any problem with the formation of my h5 or xmf file.  Therefore although you suspect the h5 file it could easily be your xml too. 
In reading your email I have a few ideas you might want to try out:
1 - I couldn't get the xmdf API to work either so I had to resort to writing the xmf files by hand.  However, rather than using the hdf5 api directly I made use of a python module called PyTables which wraps the hdf5 api and works seamlessly with Numpy.  For me it worked well well because I was dealing with Numpy information already. 
2 - Another piece of handy software is an hdf5 viewer.  There is one available from the hdf people directly called hdfview I think, but I have used another one called vitables which is by the same people as pytables.  The niece thing here is that you can open up the hdf5 file and actually look at how the array came into the file.  If for example there is something wrong with the hdf file it should either be visible as an anomaly in the data or the file simply won't open if the problem is serious. 
3 - For the geometry you should check that your array is the shape you think it is. You are specifying XYZ which means that it needs to be in a Nx3 array like like:
2 3 51 2 47.1 5.12 4.....
If your xyz data is in a different format you could should use another format like X_Y_Z where each coordinate is in its own  vector.  I think you have this ok in your example but it would be worth checking that your coordinate information is in fact the right shape.
4 - In the xml you might want to check how to handle spaces in window's paths when specifying the heavy data.  I don't use windows much so I'm not sure if this matters but under Linux this would be bad.  Small errors like this (or misspelled words in the path) can cause hard crashes like this.
5 - In the xml the dimensions should be specified with the slowest varying dimension first (i.e. KJI order). In your xml you have the reverse.  This was taken right from the xdmf website but I had some difficulty in figuring out exactly what they meant by it.  It looked to me that there were contradictory examples on the xdmf website so you might have to play around with the permutations of the order here to get it right if this is the problem.
Oh - and in reference to your other email regarding a crash that happens after you've gone through a few timesteps.  One guess could be that you are running out of memory. I had this problem when I was using very large datasets (5 million unstructured points) with an older version of Xdmf and Paraview.  They have really increased the time support in both recently (within last couple of months) so if your version of either is older than that I would suggest rebuilding both from a more recent release.
Anyways I hope that helps.  If you have more problems there is usually a pretty good amount of xdmf help on the paraview list.  One of the developers (Jerry Clarke at Army Research Labs in the US) is around from time to time and is very helpful.

I?m trying to write my data in the xdmf-format and read it in paraview. I have a 3D - curvilinear grid, i.e. I have to specify every point with its coordinates and then I have scalar attribute data, to be assigned to each node. 
The .xmf meta-data file is recognised by paraview and works fine, but when I click the "Apply"- button, paraview crashes. I believe that I get the .h5 files wrong, when I write them (as I don?t get the Xdmf-API to work, I writing the .xmf-file "manually" with a program and the .h5-files with the HDF5-API. 
Does anyone know how to set the parameters for writing the correct .h5-file (Rank, and the shape of the array which is written to the file)? 
This is as I have it now:

The coordinate file, which has (in this case) the dimensions 350 140 1. 
I write the coordinates in the following array:
float* Coordinates;
Coordinates = new float [3*xdims];
int j=0; //counter

//write xCoord to array
for(i=0;i<xdims;i=i+3) 
    {Coordinates[i] = xPoints[j];
     j++;
    }
//write yCoord to array
j=0;
for(i=1;i<xdims;i=i+3) 
    {Coordinates[i] = yPoints[j];
     j++;
    }
//write zCoord to array
for(i=2;i<xdims;i=i+3) 
    {Coordinates[i] = 0.0;
    }

This array obviously has rank 1, so I write the .h5 file with the following parameters:

file = H5Fcreate(H5FileName.c_str(), H5F_ACC_TRUNC , H5P_DEFAULT, H5P_DEFAULT);
dataspace = H5Screate_simple(1, dims, NULL);
datatype = H5Tcopy(H5T_NATIVE_FLOAT);
status = H5Tset_order(datatype,H5T_ORDER_LE);
dataset = H5Dcreate2(file,DATASETNAME1,datatype,dataspace,H5P_DEFAULT,H5P_DEFAULT,H5P_DEFAULT);
status = H5Dwrite(dataset, H5T_NATIVE_FLOAT, H5S_ALL, H5S_ALL, H5P_DEFAULT, Coordinates);


The attribute data files I write analogue. 

My .xmf file looks like this:
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<!DOCTYPE Xdmf SYSTEM "Xdmf.dtd" []>

<Xdmf>
<Domain>
<Grid Name="Curvilinear" GridType="Uniform">

Guy,

You'll have to setup the server configuration first from the GUI. Start 
paraview then choose File|Connect. In the Choose Server dialog you can 
set up your server configuration using Add Server and give it a name -- 
say "myLocalHost". Then you can use the following:

paraview --server=myLocalHost

Subject: [Paraview] HDF5 1.8
Message-ID: <20081024161828.GA23662@brakk.ethz.ch>

I have been building CVS Paraview against my own HDF5 1.8.1 install by
defining H5_USE_16_API with no problems.  After a recent CVS update, my
compile failed due to an ABI change in the (undocumented) struct
H5FD_class_t used in Utilities/Xdmf2/libsrc/XdmfH5Driver.cxx.  I don't
know why Xdmf2 needs to use this undocumented struct, but the patch
below is a simple way to make things work with 1.8 again.  It would be
better for CMake to define a variable for the real version of HDF5
rather than branch on H5_USE_16_API.

Subject: [Paraview] Ensight and FLUENT
Message-ID: <4901E81B.3090207@yahoo.de>

Hi All,

I have spent some more time to use paraview for FLUENT now with the
latest 3.4.0 I still have problems with import:

    * direct import works fine mostly. However, I am unable to extract
      surface zones. There is no way to do postporcessing for external
      flows that way. Is there any way to split the surface?
    * Using Ensight imports surface parts. This allows postprocessing.
      However, I get sementation faults quite often with that. E.g.
      FLUENT tutorial 6 exported as Ensight (node based, binary or
      ascii) gives a segfault for me. Am I the only one with this problem?

Maybe someone out there has some tips? Thanks.

Dear all,

I wan to animate the rotation about the vertical axis of active view. I have
not much knowledge on camera parameters. How can set the appropriate
parameters in camera values of animation Keyframes?

Many thanks,

Message-ID: <9813162a0810260715n50ada9d9ife9e2dbc8b4dd3a@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I am trying to write a reader for an in-house file format as a plugin.
 I have managed to write
a basic plugin to display some data in a rectilinear grid following
some of the examples.  Our file format
can hold more than one variable (pressure/temperature etc) similar to hd5.

At the moment, my data is displayed using code shown below

vtkRectilinearGrid* output;
output->SetDimensions(x,y,z);
output->SetXCoordinates(xcoords);
output->GetPointData()->SetScalars(scalars);

Can some one tell me, how i can display all of the known variables in
the file on the display menu (where
all items are usually loaded up - where you see filters that you chose
to apply to the data for example).
I would like the data to be displayed when the user selects a
particular variable in the same way as applying a filter for example?
Some pointers or example source codes will be of great help.

Thanks,

I would recommend not accessing anything from the paraview module from
multiple threads. One possible way using threads is to have one thread
the collects data from some source and notifies the other one when
data is available. The second thread can then fetch the data and
visualize it somehow... I didn't put a lot of thought in this though.

Hmmm. I am not sure how difficult it would be to do this. If this
feature is important to you, I suggested putting on the tracker:
http://paraview.org/Bug
I can't promise that we will get to it soon though.

I don't know the Fluent format well so excuse my ignorance. Does the
Fluent format specify surfaces as separate parts/zones? It sounds like
the reader does not allow you to import them, correct?

As for the Ensight crash problems. Please send us example files that
demonstrate the crashes so that we can track them down.

The next version (3.6) of ParaView will include better support for csv
files. The csv files will be imported as a table and we will have
filters that allow you to convert the table to other formats. For now,
you are better off sticking to another format such as the VTK format.

Hi, 
  I have used the fluent reader quite a bit. Basically the face zone
information is completely ignored. The way that the Ensight reader
handles fluid zones is to treat them as extra cell blocks. This could
also been done with the Fluent reader with a small amount of extra code.
I might do this sometime in the future, given enough time. However, I'm
very busy at the moment! I have partially done it though. So I will
follow up on this soon.

I too have the problem of crashes though. If I load a multiblock fluent
file, merge the blocks and then use a filter. The problem is the
datasets are too large to replicate the problem simply.

Best Regards
 
Dr. Nathanael Inkson,

I don't know the Fluent format well so excuse my ignorance. Does the
Fluent format specify surfaces as separate parts/zones? It sounds like
the reader does not allow you to import them, correct?

As for the Ensight crash problems. Please send us example files that
demonstrate the crashes so that we can track them down.

Folks, does anybody know if it's possible to put ParaView in full screen 
mode? Maybe undocking the main screen, I don't know. I already tried by 
clicking everywhere without any lucky... It should be easy to implement 
since PV supports tiled displays.

Regards

Subject: [Paraview] Poor movie quality (revisited)
Message-ID: <4905C3B6.1030505@nacad.ufrj.br>


Some time ago I reported the poor quality of the movies that I've been 
creating in PV version 3. They seem darkened (I turned on the lights) 
and with low resolution (952 x 554 seems to be a good resolution). No 
one answered me and I concluded that the problem was some 
misconfiguration I made. Ok, but the problem is that I'm still not able 
to save any avi file with a decent quality using PV3. In PV2, any movie 
produced had, at least, the same quality of the still images rendered on 
main window. What's the difference between PV2 and PV3 in terms of movie 
rendering? Is there anything that I could configure to solve it?

Thanks for any help

Renato.

Renato,

Is this on a windows machine? Can you try the following:
* Go to View|Settings
* In the Options dialog choose the "Render View"  in the tree view on 
the left pane and then set "Use Offscreen Rendering for Screenshots" to 
unchecked and then save the animation. Is this any better?

ParaView actually isn't all that good about animating camera rotations like
you describe (bug #5554).  You might be better off adding a transform filter
to your data and animating one of the rotation parameters.

That looks like a bug.  I submitted a report.

  http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=7858

I think the problem is with the fixed point volume renderer.  If your data
is small enough, you can work around the problem by converting the data to
an unstructured grid  That will cause the volume rendering algorithm to
switch to projected tetrahedra, which works in this regard.

Unfortunately no, the data are too bid too big.

Has anyone else experienced this problem?  Is it just because I have
so many cells in one block?  To reproduce: compile structured grid
generator that is attached, create grid with dimensions 1000 x 1000 x
80, use clean to grid to make unstructured, and then try viewing the
surface.

Note: this uses quite a bit of memory....

Hello,

Via paraview python servermanager, we can connect to a running pvserver with python. But, is it possible to launch a pvserver on a remote computer from servermanager before connecting via servermanager module ? 

Or is it necessary to use python sockets ?

Thanks

Hi Utkarsh,

yes, I'm using a Windows machine and the offscreen rendering option has 
not helped so much :-(

Just for comparison, I produced the same movie using PV3.4.0 and 
PV2.6.2. Take a look:

ParaView-3.4.0 (Offscreen rendering for screenshots UNchecked):
http://www.nacad.ufrj.br/~rnelias/paraview/movies/pv-3.4.0_offscreen-UNCHECKED.avi

ParaView-3.4.0 (Offscreen rendering for screenshots checked):
http://www.nacad.ufrj.br/~rnelias/paraview/movies/pv-3.4.0_offscreen-CHECKED.avi

ParaView-2.6.2:
http://www.nacad.ufrj.br/~rnelias/paraview/movies/pv-2.6.2.avi

What do you think?

Renato.

Hi Renato,

I am confused, why do you say unchecking use-offscreen hasn't helped 
much? I can see that pv-3.4.0_offscreen-UNCHECKED.avi is well-lit when 
compared with pv-3.4.0_offscreen-CHECKED.avi, or am I missing something 
here?

There is no option to start a remote pvserver from python directly. But 
you can certainly use python's process management API to fork a new 
pvserver processes etc.

Renato,
Try turning off the light kit.  That gave me some trouble in the past.  If that helps, try removing the personalized paraview config files.

Hi Renato,

I am confused, why do you say unchecking use-offscreen hasn't helped much? I can see that pv-3.4.0_offscreen-UNCHECKED.avi is well-lit when compared with pv-3.4.0_offscreen-CHECKED.avi, or am I missing something here?

This is probably due to a Windows OpenGL bug. It sounds like you have
an older graphics card or you are on a laptop with intel graphics. If
you turn off the light kit from the render view options OR if you turn
off offscreen rendering when saving images, this should go away.

Forgive me. In fact, it helped. When I said that, I was making reference 
to the movie produced by pv.2.6.2 which, in my opinion, is the best in 
quality.

That difference is definitely because of setting differences between
the two version. 3 uses light kit by default. 2 did not, I believe.

I'm doing other tests with a NVidia's card (with no luck yet). In fact, 
I was using the intel video card of my laptop (Vaio VGN-SZ430N) which 
was the same card used to render the movie using pv-2.6.2. The best in 
my opinion. Berk, I must keep at least one light turned on (headlight or 
the light kit), otherwise, I will get a completely dark image. I'll try 
copying the light kit attributes from pv-2.6.2 to pv-3.4.0.

My plugin writer does not show up in ParaView drop-down menu of save
file types (unlike my plugin readers). Problem is I get no
hints/errors/warnings whatsoever. How can I debug what is happening,
e.g. see if something goes wrong with the xml server file?

I am posting my xml file here, but actually I would much prefer to be
able to debug this myself rather than have someone point me with a
finger to a wrong line...

Subject: [Paraview] Update Slice Filter / Python Equivalent of "Apply"
Message-ID: <alpine.LRH.2.00.0810271708520.19259@DIPWS019>

What is the python script equivalent of the "Apply" button for the
"slice" filter?


I have an image file .mha to which I applied the slice filter.
I can change the normal direction of the slice from a python script.

  pm        = servermanager.ProxyManager()
  mha_slice = pm.GetProxy("sources","mha_slice")
  view1     = pm.GetProxy("views","RenderViewer1")
  widget    = pm.GetProxy("3d_widgets_prototypes","ImplicitPlaneWidgetRepresentation1")
  widget.Normal =  [ 1 , 0 , 0]
  view1.StillRender()



The normal plane is updated, but I can't get the 
slice filter to cut the data and display the 
approriate slice plane. I'm guessing the "apply" button
updates the Pipeline ?  so i tried

   UpdatePipeline()
   UpdatePipelineInformation()
   Update()
   UpdateRequired()
   UpdateSelfAndAllInputs()
   UpdateVTKObjects()


but I cannot get the same behavior as the "apply" button


?


thanks,

What else then WHOLE_EXTENT, UPDATE_EXTENT and SetExtent and do I have
to fill in RequestInformation/RequestData of my plugin reader (derived
from vtkImageAlgorithm) in order for Paraview to see the dataset's
extents? Only bounds are displayed in the Information tab, while for
native file formats there is also extents. But when I save the file in
legacy format for a test the extent is written correctly, so it WAS
known to Paraview, only not displayed properly. What is wrong?

Thanks Mike, but this is exactly what I have.
Are you sure you see both bounds and extents in Information?

This is running the latest CVS version, linux (Suse 9.3) and 64bit.
It is definitely not a problem with memory allocation - the machine
has 64GB of RAM and it was only using about 14GB for the mesh with
solution (even less for the example in the last email).  I did have a
quick try changing the variable to unsigned int but there were other
problems.    I understand people use ParaView for much bigger meshes
but it must just be because it is all in one block.

Regards,
Paul

Message-ID: <1c02becc0810280130n1f4f288cq5118e8b1b8a22f05@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

   Has anybody found problems when trying to build CVS version of paraview
with ICE-T. I am trying to use CMake.
But it gives the error messages
"CMake Error at Utilities/IceT/src/ice-t/CMakeLists.txt:26 (INSTALL):
install library TARGETS gives no DESTINATION!"
"CMake Error at Utilities/IceT/src/communcation/CMakeLists.txt:21 (INSTALL):
install library TARGETS gives no DESTINATION!"
"CMake Error at Utilities/IceT/src/strategies/CMakeLists.txt:21 (INSTALL):
install library TARGETS gives no DESTINATION!"

BTW, it was totally OK without ICE-T.

Thanks,
Mengda

One more question: where do you derive your reader from (maybe the
parent class sets something for you)?

Message-ID: <5D20F4AE6EF4C44B8932FE91E08AF0E9BAD1EB@U-SANTORIN.dif.dam.intra.cea.fr>

Hi all,

 

Does anyone have a simple example of a representation plugin? 

I tried to mimic VTKEdge xml files (which integrates representation
plugins), but I failed.

So a very simple and standalone example would be really appreciated!

 

Thanks,

Thierry.

Thanks Mike,

Yeah, no doubt I am doing something wrong, but am clueless. At the end
of RequestData

	this->GetOutput()->GetExtent(extent);

gets a valid extent. But PV does not see it (and screws up some filters).

At the top of RequestData() method how are you getting the output  
object? Maybe that has something to do with it?

You can take a look at my code <http://echo1.bluequartz.net/viewvc/CTMD/PVPhaseField/src/Readers/vtkH5PhaseFieldReader.cpp?view=markup 
 > and compare with your own.

Paul,

Have you compiled with VTK_USE_64BIT_IDS set to on?  I wouldn't think you
would be needing an id > 2^31, but if you did that could cause problems.

The blackrose and amber5 dashboards all compile IceT, and they look like
they are working well enough.  You can use the dashboard to look at their
compile settings.

You may start by upgrading your CMake if you have not done so recently.

Sure he needs more than 2^31. 32 bit signed value of -1721647736  
(0x9961BD88) can be reinterpreted as 2573319560 in unsigned 32 bit  
value. So Paul has overflowed the capacity of a signed 32 bit integer.  
I had already submitted a few patches for vtkDataSetSurfaceFilter for  
32/64 bit issues. There obviously seem to be more.

In the header file we have:

int FastGeomQuadArrayLength;

And if we look at the debug session that Paul sent:

(gdb) print this->FastGeomQuadArrayLength
$2 = -1721647736

We can see that he is over flowing the index. My guess (and I have no  
way of testing this) would be to declare some of the "int"s in that  
class to be vtkIdType instead.

At least these
   int FastGeomQuadArrayLength;
   int NumberOfFastGeomQuadArrays;

   // These indexes allow us to find the next available face.
   int NextArrayIndex;
   int NextQuadIndex;

Paul, are you in a position where you can make the changes and  
recompile paraview?

Thanks for the code, but I am doing all you are doing... (except my
reader is static (no time), maybe this makes a difference?)

Are you using PV 3.4 or CVS?

PV 3.4 Release and CVS both work. Time shouldn't make a difference.  
Not sure at this point without seeing all your code. Maybe another set  
of "eyes" can spot the difference.

Subject: [Paraview] The VTK dashboard...
Message-ID: <f435c2c50810280812r6a323b93p7efa6d5adb43cf69@mail.gmail.com>

...is kind of getting to be a mess. (I'm being polite here.)
If you have committed code to VTK or ParaView in the last month or so,
please take a look at some of the build errors, warnings and test failures
and clean up what is yours. I realize we are all busy: all the more reason
to keep it clean as we go. The cleaner it is, the less dashboard
investigation everybody has to do.

The current state of affairs makes it very difficult for those of us
committing code occasionally to have much confidence in the dashboard
system. We have to wade through error after error and say to ourselves "I
don't think my changes could cause this error..."

You have until mid-November. Then I will start to make your holiday season
miserable if I trace the cause of a given VTK dashboard failure to your CVS
alias. If you committed code on somebody else's behalf, track them down and
resolve it...

Thanks,
David Cole


P.S. -- Nobody likes a scrooge-y Dave Cole this time of year. Help keep the
holiday seasons filled with good cheer. ;-)

I posted the plugin code under:

http://www.vision.ee.ethz.ch/~domi/tmp/hdf5reader/

It works very well, only the Extent does not make it to PV Information
tab - and some filters screw up.

I would be very happy if someone proves me blind, I am frustrating
myself full time since yesterday.

Thanks,
Dominik

Hi,

I found the same issue under winXP - cmake 2.6.2
It seems that the line 

  INSTALL(TARGETS icet_strategies 
    LIBRARY DESTINATION ${ICET_INSTALL_LIB_DIR} COMPONENT 
RuntimeLibraries)

is raising an error in cmake.
changing it to 
  INSTALL(TARGETS icet_strategies 
    RUNTIME DESTINATION ${ICET_INSTALL_LIB_DIR} COMPONENT RuntimeLibraries
    LIBRARY DESTINATION ${ICET_INSTALL_LIB_DIR} COMPONENT 
RuntimeLibraries)

fixes it. 
I don't know if it is an ice-t issue or a cmake one.

Stephane

Re: [Paraview] Paraview and ICE-T






The blackrose and amber5 dashboards all compile IceT, and they look like
they are working well enough.  You can use the dashboard to look at their
compile settings.

You may start by upgrading your CMake if you have not done so recently.

It is very possible that I broke Ice-T install rules. I changed them
for the 3.4 release process. I will take a look at this soon.

What do you mean with "Ensight writer"? I export results in FLUENT to
Ensight so I use the FLUENT Ensight writer. This works e.g. for FLUENT
Tutorial 1. Afterwards you can read this into Paraview using the
Paraview Ensight reader... Sometimes Paraview crashes wile reading the
data (but not the mesh), eg. FLUENT Tutorial 6.

I am using CMake-2.6.2.

I think there are some issues about the install rules. A month ago, CMake
does not give any error when configuring.
But it does not install the icet related dlls into the destination.

Now, CMake gives these errors when configuring.

Subject: [Paraview] pqNamedWidgets Question
Message-ID: <49088085.5080900@gmail.com>

Currently the automatic linking that is done in this class is not aware 
of the new Model/View/Controller objects like QTreeView. Has there been 
any work done on supporting linking to a View by creating a basic model. 
If not, what steps should I take to create a model inside pqNamedWidgets 
and have it linked to a view I created.

The reason I want to do this is because the MVC system in qt allows you 
to setup automatic filtering using the QSortFilterProxyModel which seems 
to be the best way to filtering, if we already have something that does 
a reasonable filtering speed on a tree I would love to hear it.

Subject: [Paraview] test data for readers?
Message-ID: <490880AD.80401@kitware.com>

Hi all,

I need data sets to test new a collection of PV readers. Does any one 
have any data sets I could use for the following formats? I think I 
cleaned out the ones that PV already supports but if I missed one then 
please ignore. Thanks in advance!

Subject: [Paraview] Reader
Message-ID: <9813162a0810291344rc429c40wb2e5b333cfe8e809@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I am in the process of writing a reader as a plug in.

At the moment, i am deriving my class from vtkMultiBlockDataSet - the
data has several time steps (each time step holds several variables).

The code below works for single time step.

vtkMultiBlockDataSet *output;

//Each time step then can be created as a single instance of rectilinear Grid
vtkRectilinearGrid *grid1 = vtkRectilinearGrid::New();

grid1->SetXCoordinates(xCoords);
grid1->GetPointData()->AddArray(pressure);

output->SetDataSet(0, output->GetNumberOfDataSets(0), grid1)


How can i extend this to add several time steps - can you please give
me some pointers? or some example code?
I know that I can just add more time steps by creating more instances
of rectilinearGrid - is this the right way to go?  if so how do they
show up when rendering - can i click on the play button to loop
through all of the times steps in the data?

Ideally I would like the data to be loaded when user clicks on a
particular time step rather than loading all at once - is this
possible ? do i need to worry about this, or does paraview handle this
in some clever way?

Hello
 
Very quick question. How do you change the vertical (z) scale, e.g. make it 50% or 25% etc without altering the z-values/range?
 
Thanks
 
Lester

Change without altering? You mean appearance? Sounds like an actor property.

Hi.

I fixed the problem.  I updated those 4 variables as suggested by Mike
in vtkDataSetSurfaceFilter.h:

 int FastGeomQuadArrayLength;
 int NumberOfFastGeomQuadArrays;
 int NextArrayIndex;
 int NextQuadIndex;

All are set to vtkIdType.

Also, I needed to change how FastGeomQuadArrayLength is initialised in
vtkDataSetSurfaceFilter::InitFastGeomQuadAllocation.  So, I changed
line 1662 from

 this->FastGeomQuadArrayLength = (numberOfCells / 2) * quadSize;

to

 this->FastGeomQuadArrayLength = (numberOfCells / 2l) * quadSize;

This now allows up to 2 billion cells (since the numberOfCells
variable is passed as an int) which is sufficient for my users!

Thanks for all the help,
Paul

Subject: [Paraview] Simple Visualization
Message-ID: <a2b3004b0810300447k171d46bbmfe4f432665190b45@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,
I am a complete newbie in visualization, so an apology in advance is
what I ask will sound trivial.
I am browsing several Paraview tutorials, but I am missing out what I
really need.
Right now, I do NOT need e.g. to plot a temperature field on a metal
slab with a non-trivial geometry. Rather, I have a set of particles
(each is a simple sphere) in a 3D-box. The raw data is an ascii file
of the form:

x_1  y_1  z_1
x_2  y_2  z_2
.............
x_N  y_N  z_N

In each position {x_i,y_i,z_i} there is a sphere having radius 0.5.
Hence I do not have a grid but only a list of positions of some
spheres in space.
How should I deal with that in Paraview? Which format should I convert
my ascii file to?
In case it turns out to be useful to fix the ideas, I paste below an
example case with 50 particles (each line should contain three
numbers, but I do not know how it will be shown by your email client).
Many thanks

Lorenzo

Yes. Keep the data as is but just change the visual scale. S instead of your z-axis being say 5cm (if you measured it on screen) you want to reduce it to a smaller scale say 1 or 2 cm. I couldn't see an obvious location to do this in Paraview. There is a scale filter - is that the tool ?

Subject: [Paraview] Simple Visualization
In-Reply-To: <a2b3004b0810300447k171d46bbmfe4f432665190b45@mail.gmail.com>
Message-ID: <C52F1C71.2EB8%kmorel@sandia.gov>

To be honest, ParaView doesn't make loading in a simple list of coordinates
as easy as it should.  It's something we will be working on in the near
future (e.g. bug #5016, http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=5016).
However, it is still possible to do what you want, it just takes a few more
steps than it should.

I think the easiest way to get your data into ParaView is to convert it to a
legacy VTK file.  From what you attached below, all you need to do is add
some header in front of it.  Below I have included a modified form of your
data that conforms to the legacy VTK file format (hopefully line endings are
preserved again, because they matter in the header).  Copy the data into a
file with a .vtk extension and you will be able to load it into ParaView.

When you first load this into ParaView, you will not actually see anything
drawn.  This is because I was too lazy to add cells to the data.  However,
you can use the Glyph filter to add the exact geometry you described (a
sphere of radius 0.5).  After loading the data (don't forget to hit the
Apply button), add the Glyph filter (there is a convenient toolbar button
with an image of a large sphere covered by smaller green spheres).  Change
the "Glyph Type" to "Sphere".  The default radius happens to be 0.5, so you
are good to hit the Apply button and you should see your particles.

Hope that helps.

Or, try out the example of a python programmable reader that I've just
posted to the wiki.
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Here_are_some_more_examples_of_simple_ParaView_3_python_filters.

To use it, open up Source->Programmable Source, set the output type to
Poly Data, paste in the text, correct the filename, and in your case
change the separator from "," to " ".

Then apply the glyph filter. As Ken suggested.

Can you post images? It would help diagnose what is happening.

No.

Python is a general purpose programming language. There are many books
and online resources about it.

About using Python to control paraview, take a look at the paraview
wiki, there are pages about python scripting paraview some recent
excellent tutorials there about what can be done with scripting.

You can manually change the glyphs shape and size. It has some default
size which is probably not working well with your data. You can also
supply values with each point and have the glyphs shaped and oriented
according the the values.

How does povray determine the size?

In visualization glyphs often scaled according to some scalar property
at each point. For example points with a value corresponding to a
larger atomic number (or temperature or density or velocity magnitude
or whatever) could be made bigger. Glyphs are often oriented according
to a vector or tensor orientation too.

Either.

Try this: in the GUI filter the source or readers output through a
calculator filter to add an array with a constant value. Then apply
the Glyph filter and scale by the new array. Now save the output of
the calculator as a VTK file and compare it with the original.

Alright, we'll get to the bottom of this.
This is a list of what I do (which is clearly NOT working).
(1) open the .VTK file I emailed you.
(2)click apply
(3) I cannot select the calculator filter right now in the GUI hence
(4) I apply a gliph filter and set the radius to 0.1
(5) I can now apply a calculator filter. I leave the defaults and
write 1 in the empty space before applying it
(6) nothing changes in the snapshot apart from the color
(7) select again gliph filter, set sphere to radius 0.1 and click
apply (In the "scalar" field I now read "Result", so I thought
Paraview somehow had info about the previous filter I had applied),
(8) Now everything is red and I have no idea of what I should do.

What am I doing wrong?
Regards

Lorenzo

I can not replicate that problem. As soon as I hit apply the
calculator filter is an option. I am on paraview 3.4.

It shouldn't. You have just associated some data with the polygonal
spheres. You have not made them larger.

The color changed because you now have some associated data, not just
locations to work with, so paraview automatically colormaps the data.
Your data is pretty boring (everything has the value 1.0), so the
color is pretty lame, (everything is red).

> (7) select again gliph filter, set sphere to radius 0.1 and click

Yes, this second glyph filter now has something besides the x,y,z
locations to work with. It has the same associated data that caused
the color to change.

> (8) Now everything is red and I have no idea of what I should do.

At the bottom of Glyph2's Properties Tab of the Object Inspector,
change scale mode to scalar.

What you will now see is not what are aiming for, it actually shows a
sphere on top of every vertex within the original sets of spheres. But
change the calculator filters expression and see what happens.

You should figure out why the calculator couldn't be applied to the
final_config.vtk file reader's output.

Message-ID: <BAY143-W49612A7E17A6D2707900F68A210@phx.gbl>


Hello all
 
I have got a really big dataset that I want to have in a binary format. I have the header information all sorted now, but want to know how to convert the data part to binary. From what I understand the binary VYK structure is basically the same as ascii except the data part is binary.
 
On a second point, with an ascii VTK how can I change the data from a huge long column of data to the more sequential style shown in examples? 
 
I work on a PC
 
thanks
 
Lester

Hi to all, this is my first message

I am kind of newbie to Paraview and VTK. I am trying to build some
vectors from a series of Gaussian Gube files (see the link), but I am
not able. I try to group them and then open a calculator with the
formula
AuCp2.RHO.X.cube*iHat+AuCp2.RHO.Y.cube*jHat+AuCp2.RHO.Z.cube*kHat
but it complains that
ERROR: In ..\..\..\ParaView3\VTK\Graphics\vtkArrayCalculator.cxx, line 305
vtkArrayCalculator (0E9462E0): Invalid array name: AuCp2.RHO.X.cube

Is there any easy wey or should I try to convert the data to a VTK
format with vectors previously?

The name of the array is invalid it means there is no such array in your
datafile.

You have the basic idea for binary legacy VTK files.  I think the one caveat
is that the data needs to be written in big-endian format.  (Someone correct
me if I got that wrong.)

I'm not sure what you mean by the column vs. sequential style.  I think the
data parts in ASCII data treat all whitespace the same, so you should be
able to order the data in as many columns as you like.

Hi Ken
 
Thanks for the info. So is there an easy way to take the ascii data and make it into a binary file (big-endian or ortherwise), or is it more involved? Basically I have my data already it just needs converting.

Hi,

About one year ago, I got some C code from the VisIt site from LLNL, 
which allows you to write legacy (.vtk) files using quite easy-to-use 
wrapper functions. It writes both in ascii and binary and checks for 
correct endian. I googled for the filenames just now and found them 
here: http://www-vis.lbl.gov/Vignettes/SNAZ/visit_writer_float/

I cannot write binary data to newer XML files since I understood that it 
has to be in base64 encoding and I wanted to export my data without 
using external libraries such as vtk. If there is an option to write 
binary xml files, I'd like to hear about it.

Regards,
Ivo

This unexpected. I am on Debian testing and I have paraview 3.2.2.

So this makes sense now.

Here I am a bit flying blind. Changing the numerical value in the
filter (1, 5, 10) does not do anything at first sight.
However, if I save everything to a legacy ascii vtk file, I now get
something large (about 30Mb).

This is really the bad news. Does anyone on this list use paraview
from Debian testing standard repositories?
Actually, I should add now the problem of visualizing correctly the
spheres appears even in the simple example with 50 particles only;
there I noticed that the particles (by using radius 0.5) are actually
slightly smaller than they should be (and povray also disagrees).
I am puzzled; I thought all this would take minutes.
Cheers

Subject: [Paraview] Mac OS X - Standalone bundle
Message-ID: <3A82A156-8A19-4C3C-842A-719425498894@videotron.ca>

Good morning,

with the latest version of Paraview (3.5.0), I understand that there  
is a new script
(paraview_OSX_MakeStandAloneBundle.sh) to create the Mac OS X  
application bundle.
However, the application only weights now 15 M and in fact is not  
standalone as before ->
the build directory is needed to launch it. Any thoughts on how to  
solve this problem ?

Best regards,

PO

Hello all
 
I have started to compile myhuge dataset and I noticed a bit of a problem in terms of the coordinates, as indicated by the cube axes. I have attached a couple small jpegs to show what I mean. PV_test1.JPG is a screenshot from Paraview and PV_test2.jpg is a image from SURFER where I gridded the data up from XYZ files. The data in SURFER are gridded and oriented correctly with respect to the axes whereas the data as displayed in Paraview are rotated by 90 degrees it seems. This is the header file I have used to test the data:
 
# vtk DataFile Version 3.0vtk outputASCIIDATASET STRUCTURED_POINTSDIMENSIONS 151 151 2SPACING 200 -200 -100ORIGIN 291024 2055975 0POINT_DATA 45602SCALARS density doubleLOOKUP_TABLE default2.282.282.28
 
Any ideas how I can get the data oriented correctly to match the output of SURFER?
 
Thanks
 
Lester

One possible reason may be the different order of the data.

Looks like your original data stored in the order (Row major format):

for i=
      for j=
            for k=

But paraview is reading as (Column major format):

for k=
       for j=
             for i=

If this is the case, you should write the data in correct order.

Good luck!

You need to do a "make install" to produce the standalone bundle.
I recommend using...:
DESTDIR=pvinst make install

...and then getting the standalone bundle out of the pvinst directory...

Why do you say the build directory is needed to launch it? What happens if
you move/rename the build directory and try to launch the standalone bundle?

Thanks David !

yes, the make install works / I did not know that invoking the make  
install was required to build the standalone app / this changed over
the last month.

Since I'm building Paraview and OpenFOAM from a sensitive-case disk  
image, ParavIew could not launch yesterday
from /Applications since the disk image was not mounted. Now  
everything is good - the standalone applications weigths
185 M as before.

Best regards,

PO

Hello,
I installed from source version 3.4.2. Now I can follow your procedure.
I generated the new vtk file (saved as ascii), but it is definitely
different from what I started from:

[...]

For instance, now there are many more points. The generated text file
is above 20Mb, so it is not a piece of cake to look for its new
features.
Cheers

Lorenzo

This is what I meant:

1) load the vtk file
ParaView now makes a pipeline that looks like this

     FileReader->Data

And the data is like so (just a list of points in space):
x1,y1,z1:
x2,y2,z2:
...

2) Apply the Calculator Filter to add a constant valued point
associated array to the data.

Now the Pipeline looks like this:
   FileReader->Data->Calculator->Data'

And Data looks the same as it did,
While Data' is a set of locations in space, each with an associated value:
x1,y1,z1:someconstant
x1,y1,z1:someconstant
...

3) save Data' to a file. Click on Calculator filter in pipelinebrowser
and select file->Save Data, and choose the VTK format.

4) compare the input and output files to see what the file should look
like to give each vertex file format for data with values

Now that the data has some value, the glyph filter has something to
work with to let it decide how large to make the polygons that make up
each sphere.

5) load Data' into VTK, apply the glyph filter and turn scaling by
scalar value on.

If the values meant something (like atomic number), instead of just
being a constant value, the glyph size would mean something. Without
that, the glyph filter just makes each sphere exactly 0.5 units wide
because it can not guess what you need it to look like.

I am quite surprised that povray will make a guess actually. How does
it know what radius to choose that looks right? Are you trying to draw
stars from your list of coordinates, apples int a bin, marbles on a
table, bubbles in a pint of beer, or atoms in a molecule?

cheers,
Dave
