Hi Ken,

thank you for your looking into it. My actual application will in fact have HDF5 in the second DataItem. But then I encountered problems and tried to figure it out using a simple example first.

Can you confirm that my xmf sample file is syntactically correctly for its designated purpose?

Best, Jens.

I have tried various combinations, but I get crashes on Linux, crashes on Windows (using 3.8.1. 64bit, not necessarily for the same cases), and whenever I manage to load it without a crash, the spreadsheet view indicates that the contents of the source array is just copied element-wise to the target array, disregarding the contents of the HyperSlab's first DataItem.

Subject: [Paraview] Delayed load pqLoadDataReaction
Message-ID: <AANLkTikoYopkxE+d0+N2mLHY1fWxeL9rtNxEnmsm6pC_@mail.gmail.com>

Hello

I am developing an application based on the clone2 source in paraview 3.8.1.

I am using the following code to automatically show and accept loaded data:

this->ui->proxyTabWidget->setShowOnAccept(true);
new pqAutoApplyReaction(this->ui->actionAutoApply);


And I am using pqLoadDataReaction::loadData(stringList) to add the data.

I am wondering how one can know when the data/objects have actually been
loaded? This so you can make changes to that data.

After loading new data I want to do the following (change the ColorMap on
the new objects):

pqDataRepresentation *currentDisplay =
qobject_cast<pqPipelineRepresentation*>(pqActiveObjects::instance().activeRepresentation());
vtkSMProxy *lookupTable = currentDisplay->getLookupTable()->getProxy();

But that code crashes (since the objects have not yet loaded?).

Any ideas? Thanks.

BR/ Christoffer

YOu might want to listen to representationAdded(..) signal fired by
the source. I am guessing you're trying to access the representation
even before its created.

Hi!

I have a demo .pvtr, which can't be loaded correctly. Paraview crashes. What's wrong on this file? 

The files are attached to this Mail. In VisIt, .pvtr is not supported, but the .vtr are loaded.
Even the ghost cells are detected.

Best,
Michael Scheerer

Hi,

In your python script you can set the view size:

RenderView1.ViewSize = [800, 600]

If you want to the image to be larger than your desktop window can normally
handle, you can pass a Magnification argument to the WriteImage command in
your python script.

WriteImage("out.png", Magnification=2)

This will use the aspect ratio according to the view size you have set.

To close the loop on this issue on the list, we tracked this down and
I've committed a fix to git-master. I should be included in the 3.10
release (not sure it will make it into the 3.10.rc1 however).

    Fixed extra data-delivery when outline was used for LOD.

    When every LOD was enabled, and setting was set so that outline is used, it
    would invalidate the full res pipeline as well. Fixed that. As a
side effect,
    when outline needs to be delived to the client and LOD threshold
is higher than
    the outline threshold, we force LOD mode. This avoids an arificial linking
    between the LOD threshold and the outline threshold while at the
same time avoid
    re-delivery of full-res data.

Sorry for answering only now.
I think I'm using the 3.8.1, for windows 32 bits. Maybe should I try with
the 3.10.0-RC1 ?

For other questions : surfaceLIC is autolaoded at the launching of Paraview.
And it can work if I use the Calculator in order to calculate a vector.
In fact, I just don't see the toolbar, and then I can't choose the Active
Vector Fieds in order surfaceLIC to work.

... Maybe something wrong in the .xml file ?

Subject: [Paraview] Measurement of area
Message-ID: <9815445.2641811296659990326.JavaMail.defaultUser@defaultHost>

I need to determine the value of the area of a surface.

I generated a .vtp surface with a python code. With python a created an array 
which associates id 0 to points with particular features and 1 to all the other 
points. 
When I open the .vtp file with Paraview I display surface according to the 
array (0/1). 
I need to extract from the surface the value of the area formed by points with 
id 0.

Is there any way to do that?

Hi Michael,

You are missing this in the pvtr file:

    <PCoordinates>
      <PDataArray type="Float32"/>
      <PDataArray type="Float32"/>
      <PDataArray type="Float32"/>
    </PCoordinates>

ParaView should have reported an error but there is a bug in the error
handling code and it crashes instead. I'll fix that bug.

By the way, if your final target is to larger datasets, I'd strongly
recommend using the appended binary mode without compression or
encoding. ParaView reads that the fastest. Details on how to write
appended binary are here:

Best,

Your problem is a bit ill defined.  What happens when a polygon has some points that are 0 and other points that are 1?  Do you include the entire polygon, throw away the polygon, or include some fraction of it?

Regardless, I think the easiest way to solve the problem is to first remove the part of the mesh that does not include the desired feature/points.  Once you do that you can run the Integrate Attributes filter to get the resulting area.

To remove polygons not in class 0, use the threshold filter with the upper threshold set to something lower than 1.  If you want to clip the polygons to use some fraction of polygons containing both class 0 and class 1 points, use the clip filter, set the Clip Type to Scalar, set the Value to something between 0 and 1, and enable Inside Out.

Hi Gerard,

I don't think that this is an IO issue. It may be an issue with the
FFMPEG library that we use to write animations. Actually, which
platform are you on? One thing to try is to save images and then use
another tool to create the movies. I use Quicktime for this purpose
all the time. There are other tools that do it too, like EnVe from
CEI: http://www.ensight.com/EnVe/enve.html. If this only happens when
saving AVIs from ParaView, it is probably the library we use.

Well, I had a quick look to the source files...
In fact, Paraview completely ignores the vtkSurfaceLICRendering.xml file.
Is it an option in cmake that I missed ?

Hi Berk,

Thank you for the answer!

An addition question:

Paraview supports in the case of CGNS files volume rendering.
Volume rendering is in the list together with "Outline", "Surface" and so on.
This is not the case if someone tries to load VTK-files.
Why not?

So I couldn't see, if the ghost zone overlap works in the sense, that all the parts are really merged to one grid and not independent parts - even in the case of volume rendering.

Also PLT files crashes, although there are loadable with Tecplot and VisIt.

Best,
Michael

Dear all.

I have been trying to compile the new 3.10 paraview source under my linux
system, but got the following complaint:

Linking C shared library ../../../../bin/libvtkhdf5.so
CMakeFiles/vtkhdf5.dir/H5checksum.c.o: In function `gnu_dev_major':

And from there many more errors related to the libvtkhdf5 library. Any other
people who have experienced this error ? Do I need hdf5? Can I switch it off
?
Any hints appreciated.

That is strange, can you tell us what distro/gcc version you're using? You
can't turn hdf5 off but you could install your distros hdf5/build it
yourself and then turn on VTK_USE_SYSTEM_HDF5.

Subject: [Paraview] GUI_SOURCES vs SOURCES in ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN macro
Message-ID: <AANLkTinWDEfStKUOkT1fwcX6gfFfRD7TnBOT+_cvY3_G@mail.gmail.com>

Good afternoon,

In the Add_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN macro, there oftena re the keywords
SERVER_MANAGER_XML, SERVER_MANAGER_SOURCES and GUI_INTERFACES
Sometimes, there also are GUI_SOURCES or SOURCES.

What is the differences between the two last keywords ? (gui_sources and
sources)

Regards,

Hi Michael,

There are some subtle but important differences between VisIt and
ParaView when it comes to handling structured data:

1. VisIt's approach is to keep separate pieces - or domains or
partitions, whatever you choose to call them - separate after loading
a multi-piece dataset such as yours. They do this because it allows
them several optimization specially on the IO side. On the other hand,
ParaView treats structured datasets as one big thing, even though the
pieces may be in separate files. When reading such datasets in
parallel, ParaView will decide how to partition the dataset and have
some MPI ranks read subsets of files that lie in the boundary, if
necessary. So at the end, the partitioning of the two tools will end
being very similar. ParaView may have a slight IO overhead if it needs
to assign some files to multiple processes. The biggest difference is
that the ParaView pipeline (the VTK pipeline actually) can make
requests at a cell granularity whereas VisIt works at a piece
granularity. Honestly, this is not a big difference for most
scientific visualization application but it has a huge impact when
analyzing medical datasets because of the algorithms involved.

We are working towards integrating VisIt's design in addition to the
traditional VTK way of dealing with structured data. To get a feel for
it, you can replace your parallel rectilinear grid file with a
multi-block file (vtm). You don't have to change the actual vtr files.
I can describe how to do it if you don't already know.

2. In VisIt, the only type of rectilinear grid is vtkRectilinearGrid,
which requires explicit storage of x, y and z coordinates. In VTK,
hence ParaView, uniform rectilinear grids are best stored at
vtkImageData. The advantage of this is minimal when it comes to memory
usage but significant when it comes to algorithms. There are a large
number of algorithms targeted to vtkImageData in VTK even though many
of these are not exposed in ParaView by default. One of these
algorithms is volume rendering. At this time, ParaView supports volume
rendering of image data and unstructured grids only. In the next
release (4.0 not 3.10), we will support volume rendering for more data
types.

I tried to explain this as much as I can without writing a whole book
chapter. I hope it makes sense :-)

By the way, if you are using .pvtr files, you don't need ghost zones
(cells). ParaView will take care of loading ghost cells from neighbor
pieces if necessary.

As for the Tecplot files, are these binary files by any chance? Can
you send me an example?

Best,
-berk

Here's an extract from the ParaViewPlugins.cmake. Hope that helps.

#  SERVER_MANAGER_SOURCES will be wrapped
#  SERVER_MANAGER_XML will be embedded and give to the client when loaded
#  SERVER_SOURCES is for other source files
#  PYTHON_MODULES allows you to embed python sources as modules
#  GUI_INTERFACES is to specify which GUI plugin interfaces were implemented
#  GUI_RESOURCES is to specify qrc files
#  GUI_RESOURCE_FILES is to specify xml files to create a qrc file from

#  SOURCES is deprecated, please use SERVER_SOURCES or GUI_SOURCES

Hi David,

Distro: Scientific Linux SL release 5.2 (Boron) 64-bit version
GCC: gcc (OpenFOAM) 4.3.3

I don't know where I can find libvtkhdf. Should I build it myself. Where can
I get it ?

Regards,

Eelco

Mmm,

I can't find libvtkhdf, but only

/usr/lib64/libhdf5.so.6.0.1

Is this the same ?

Sorry yes, libhdf5 is what you can try with VTK_USE_SYSTEM_HDF5.

I am confused, are you loading the vtkSurfaceLICRender.xml file
manually? Can you reproduce the problem with the binaries. I tried the
3.8.1 binaries and they work as expected.

Unfortunately this does noet work, I got all kind of error message that it
can not find HDF include directory etc. Since I am not administrator I can
not install it in the default directories. I tried to compile the hdf lib
myself, but this didn't work as well. Beside, hdf is delivered by the
distribution right ?
Well, if there is any other suggesting ?  I am now trying with
VTK_USE_SYSTEM_HDF5 = 0 again

The error message I got now ]

No, it works fine with the binary. I can see the control panel, and all work
normally.
I load the plugin using the libsurfaceLIC.dll. That is the classical way,
isn't it ?

A colleage, that have also build Paraview on Windows, using Mingw, reproduce
this issue.
After reading the scripts, the only thing I have found to try was to change
GUI_SOURCES into SOURCES in the CMakeFile.
Unfortunately it doesn't solve anything...

Could it be something related to the names of the files, that is called
libNAME... instead of NAME...
I already met this kind of problems, due to the compilation with mingw. (for
the vtk python library for instance)

Maybe I'm completely out of context.... but maybe not :
Are you trying to build with multiple tasks ? I mean do you use : "make -j"
?

I can't remember perfectly, but it seems to me that I had something wrong,
maybe with hdf5, when using make -j ... (building on windows using
msys-mingw)

Hi Nathalie,

You need to go to the VTK directory inside the ParaView directory and add my
vtk github repo:

git remote add live-data git://github.com/patmarion/VTK.git
git fetch live-data

After you execute the git fetch command, git will be able to resolve the
75ba5e2313 reference when you update submodules.

Is there any reason why you're using mingw? We don't have anyone here
who uses mingw for ParaView unfortunately, so I cannot say it's
supported.

Not really, except in order to work with commands that I know better than
visual studio.
And there were a couple of thing that needed to be corrected in order to
build with success (thanks to my colleage that found them), but that worked
pretty good.... until now.

Then I have to use the microsoft tool, don't I ?

No, I am just making with 'make' on a single cpu. Still haven't found the
clue unfortunately. Perperhaps rebuilding the hdf5 lib. I have by the way a
different gcc compiler  which I use to build paraview than the default gcc
compiler, and I saw that the kernel was build with a different gcc compiler,
so probably also the system libraries. That could cause problems of course.
Well, thanks for the comments anyway

I'm afraid that's what I'd suggest. Unless there's a strong push from
the community to support mingw, I don't think we'd be taking the
plunge.

Just one question : on the wiki, it is written : "[...] while on Windows it
requires Visual Studio (8 or later). "
Does the free version, Visual Express, work too ?

Yes, VS9 or VS10 expressions editions should build just fine.

Yes. With the exception that Microsoft does not release a free 64 bit

Utkarsh : maybe that wouldn't be such a big plunge. There were only a few
#include <cstlib> and other minimal stuff to handle with the build using
Mingw. I had to deactivate the Cmake_use_pthreads too.

No free compiler in order to build paraview on a 64bits system then ? Unless
you know other free compilers on windows ?
(sorry, I'm really a beginner in the windows world...)

I think I will try with devc++ or code::blocks tomorrow, before abandon. Do
you have any experience with that ?
Anyway, thanks for help ! And good afternoon.

You can still use the 32-bit VS-Express compilers to build 32-bit
binaries on 64-bit machines. Unless you are loading really large
datasets, 32-bit ParaView should work just as well for you.

Subject: [Paraview]  Some tests and questions about PV 3.10.0-RC1
Message-ID: <4D4BCBAC.9080601@onera.fr>

Hello, all.

I have just downloaded the PV-3.10.0-RC1 Linux 64 binaries and it works 
fine. I Could not find the VisIt plugin in the Tools->Manage plugins 
menu, but I suppose it is now fully integrated in PV? However, I was
able to read Tecplot files, and I could also load the LIC plugin.

For all and Adriano Gagliardi: I said in a previous mail that the VisIt 
Tecplot reader in Linux PV 3.8.1 was not working on my new CentOS 5.5 
workstation. This problem is now solved with PV 3.10.0-RC1: both 
proposed Tecplot Readers, Tecplot and Tecplot(VisIt), are working fine.

Now I have just a question about rendering. When I rotate or zoom an 
object, the object rendering is coarse as in previous PV versions, but 
it remains coarse for a few seconds when I release the mouse, and I see 
a countdown in the bottom left of the window: "Full resolution render in 
: xx seconds". This is not very important but just a little bit 
annoying. Is there a parameter in the settings that could reduce this 
rendering time?

Best regards.

Hi,

Is it possible to point the path to a .xml file in the

Or an other way to do what I want to do : Is there a function similar to the
servermanager.LoadPlugin that accept the .xml plugin files ?

Subject: [Paraview] "Function" limitation/bug?
Message-ID: <4D4BE44E.2000205@tp4.rub.de>

Could it be that the Xdmf Function DataItem cannot handle more than ten operands? The sample file quoted below will load just fine into Paraview (3.8.1 64bit Linux) as long as the formula operates on any of the first ten (i.e. $0 through $9) DataItems. However, changing

Function="10 + $9">
to
Function="10 + $10">

in line 22 will cause a segfault. The obvious workaround is to use nested Function items for formulas involving more than ten operands. I'm just wondering if this is a genuine bug, or if maybe the 11th item has to be referenced by something else than "$10"?
Comments (especially from the developers) would be much apprechiated.

Jens.

Hi Richard,

You are correct the VisIt plugin has been reworked and moved into ParaView.

Thank you for the answer, Robert.

The Tecplot reader works fine with a single file that contains a 
multi-block dataset, but I encountered a problem when trying  to read 
the same data as a serie of Tecplot files.

Each file is a single block surface grid on the skin of an aircraft. 
Once I had selected all my files, I got an error message: "Group name 
and proxy must be non empty". But this was only a warning and PV was 
always running. Then I had to choose between "Tecplot Files (VisIt)" and 
"Tecplot Files" in the "Open data with.." window and click OK for each 
file in my serie.

Each time I clicked OK, a new file was loaded in the pipeline, but as I 
had selected more than 350 files, I decided to cancel. But the Cancel 
button is ignored and the "Open data with.." window appears again and 
again! The only way to cancel the reading task was to kill Paraview. I 
hope that this could be solved in the final release.

Now may I suggest an improvement for all readers? When reading huge 
datasets, the screen seems to be frozen (for about one minute with my 
full aircraft CFD dataset), and it would be nice if we could have in a 
future release some progress bar or something else indicating that PV is 
always alive.

Best regards and good week-end.

Richard.

Message-ID: <AANLkTik+KCzsZZeUmBg8Lz8b-8PdL4ELjMMbb3iW4C+Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hello All,

The ParaView team is pleased to announce the availability of the ParaView
3.10.0 Release Candidate 1 binaries for download on the ParaView download
page. The 32bit Linux binary is still missing after a package generation
snafu but will be available shortly. Also, Final 3.10 binaries should be
available within the next week or two if all goes well.

http://paraview.org/paraview/resources/software.html

Release Notes:

ParaView 3.10

This release features notable developments, including mechanisms to
incorporate advanced rendering techniques, improved support for readers and
several usability enhancements and bug fixes.

For the 3.10 release,  we have added 60 new readers. The new readers
include: ANSYS, CGNS, Chombo, Dyna3D, Enzo, Mili, Miranda, Nastran, Pixie,
Samrai, Silo, and Tecplot Binary. A full listing of supported readers can be
found in the ParaView Users Guide. We also added the ability for developers
to create ParaView reader plugins from previously developed VisIt reader
plugins. You can find a full guide on how to do this on the VisIt Database
Bridge: http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/VisIt_Database_Bridge

With this release we have rewritten the ParaView User's Guide and are making
it freely available for the first time. The complete guide can be obtained
in the help system or online at:

http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Users_Guide/Table_Of_Contents.

We have included a Python-based calculator which makes it possible to write
operations using Python. The Python calculator uses NumPy, which makes it is
possible to use advanced functions such as gradients, curls, and divergence
easily in expression. Also the NumPy module is packaged in the ParaView
binary and is importable from the ParaView Python shell.

There should also be a marked performance improvement for users dealing with
large multi-block datasets. We have cleaned up the rendering pipeline to
better handle composite datasets, avoiding the appending of all blocks into
a single dataset as was done previously.

To better utilize multiple cores on modern mutli-core machines, by default
ParaView can now run using a parallel server, even for the built-in mode.
This enables the use of all the cores for parallel data processing, without
requiring the user to start a parallel server. ParaView binaries will also
be distributed using an MPI implementation, making this feature available to
users by simply downloading the binaries. Since this is an experimental
feature, it is off by default, but users can turn it on by checking the
Auto-MPI checkbox in the application settings dialog.

Additionally, the 3.10 release includes several usability enhancements. 3D
View now supports smart context menus, accessed by right-clicking on any
object in the 3D View to change its color, representation, color map and
visibility. Left-clicking on an object in the 3D View makes it active in the
pipeline browser. Within the spreadsheet view, sorting is now supported and
an advanced parallel sorting algorithm ensures that none of the benefits of
the spreadsheet view, such as streaming and selection, are sacrificed.
Python tracing and macro controls are now exposed from the main menus, no
longer hidden under the Python shell. For an exhaustive list of the new
features and bug-fixes, please refer to the change log at:
http://www.paraview.org/Bug/changelog_page.php.

For developers interested in adding support for advanced multi-pass
rendering algorithms to ParaView, this release includes a major refactoring
of ParaView's rendering pipeline. View and representations have been
redesigned and users should see improved performance in client-server mode
from reduced interprocess communication during rendering.

LANL's MantaView interactive ray tracing plugin has been restructured to
make it easier to use. Version 2.0 of the plugin is now multi-view capable
and no longer requires ParaView to be run in a client/server configuration.
Similarly both of LANL's streaming aware ParaView derived applications have
been merged into ParaView proper in the form of a new View plugin. The
underlying streaming algorithms have been rewritten to be more usable and
extensible. Both plugins are available in standard binary package for the
first time in this release.


As always, we rely on your feedback to make ParaView better. Please use

Hi Richard,

In the 3.10 we have introduced the ability to load multiple files when using
the ctrl and shift keys. If you want to load a file series you need to
select the file series root node, not each item in the series. Doing so will
make ParaView load each file individually.

You can find a nice guide to loading files in the user guide:

Hi Richard,

I've just talked to Rob about your problem and explained your point.
Rob is going to report a bug for that.
One solution we were thinking of is when several files are selected in
the OpenFile process, if we already have define a reader for a given
extension, we reuse that same reader and ask for the reader type only
for new extension where concurrent reader exist.

What do you think ?

Subject: [Paraview] paraview crashes on obj file originating from VMD
Message-ID: <20110204234235.GC54289@cesium.hyperfine.info>

Hello

We need to export molecular structures and surface renders from UIUC's VMD 
to OBJ with color/material support into Paraview for use with VisBox. 
Paraview 3.8.1 and 3.10-RC1 both crash while trying to render the OBJ files 
here:
http://cesium.hyperfine.info/~cowbert/vmd/vmd1.obj
http://cesium.hyperfine.info/~cowbert/vmd/vmd1.mtl

Segfaults after hitting 'Apply'.

Furthermore I read somewhere that the vtk OBJ reader does not read or process
MTL files? Is this something that can be fixed? We'd really like surface 
colors and transparency to be imported from the mtl file...

Also Paraview will also crash reading in VMD output to VRML2 with a segfault:
http://cesium.hyperfine.info/~cowbert/vmd/vmd1.wrl

The VMD developers at UIUC are certain these are problems with Paraview and
not their software...

One final method might supportable is: output POV-Ray from VMD and then 
convert it to something that Paraview will read. Any ideas on that?

Thanks

Hi,

quite nice release!

I would like to report some issues on my machine...

- there is the cgns reader missing (if I understood it correct from the 
release notes, there should be one)
- for OpenFOAM file formats one often has just a '.foam' file in the 
case directory without a prefix... this is not displayed anymore in the 
open dialog
- it seems that the python calculator or programmable filter is not 
working completely using a python state file
- there is a segmentation fault when I run the attached script (this 
happened as well, when I tried to set it up with the gui for the first 
time; the second try it worked without a segmentation fault); if needed 
I could send the data!?

Best Regards!
Fabian

Hi Fabian,

Thank you for your report. Regarding the CGNS reader, it will be part of the
final binaries. I need to add some additional packaging infrastructure to
include libcgns.

Hi David and All,

I still have trouble seeing any updates in ParaView (ParaView Git built from source with VS2008 and Qt 4.6.3 on Windows 7 64bit) after loading a GRIB2 file. For simiplicity, I have created a skeleton version of my GRIB2 reader. I have only implemented RequestInformation() with some fabricated WHOLE_EXTENT() data. I have successfully built such reader as a plugin .dll (Windows) and loaded it into ParaView through Tool -> Manage Plugins. After you load a grib2 file also attached, RequestInformation() is called and WHOLE_EXTENT() has been updated. However, I do not see such change in "Object Inspector" -> "Information" panel.
I am not sure what I did wrong. And is there anything special I need to do when build ParaView from source? FYI, "BUILD_SHARED_LIB" is on.
Would you please help me? Thank you very much.

Best,
x

Subject: Write a reader plugin

Hi David and all,
I am writing a reader plugin for ParaView. A test program without the VTK wrapping approves that I can get all the header (metadata) and grid data correctly. However, when I following the examples posted in http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/ParaView/Examples/Plugins/Reader
http://www.kitware.com/products/html/WritingAParaViewReaderPlug-in.html
and vtkStructuredGridReader.h/.cxx

I got confused. Shall I subclass vtkStructuredGridAlgorithm or vtkStructuredGridReader? What are the differences? With minor differences in the code, i.e. defining char* FileName, I have both scenarios built fine. 

Let's say, we are subclassing vtkStructuredGridAlgorithm for now on. After I populate values as the following

int vtkGRIB2Reader::RequestInformation(vtkInformation* vtkNotUsed(request), 								vtkInformationVector** vtkNotUsed(inputVector),							vtkInformationVector *outputVector)
{
	...
	vtkInformation* outInfo = outputVector->GetInformationObject(0);
	
	outInfo->Set(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::WHOLE_EXTENT(),	ext, 6);
	outInfo->Set(vtkDataObject::SPACING(),	this->Spacing, 3);
	outInfo->Set(vtkDataObject::ORIGIN(), 	this->Origin, 3);	

	return 1;
}

In ParaView Object Inspector / Information widget, I did not see any update in all the fields except Statistics / Type: Structured (Curvilinear) Grid. Would you please help me? Did I populate outInof in the wrong place? Thanks a lot.

Best,
xunlei

Yes, I attached the error messages (using pvpython and running the 
script from the gui) and scripts; the original state file pvsm works 
fine. The script 'test.py' (with two different error messages 
testError*) is the one, which was saved as a state file and 
'pyCalculator.py' (errormsg.txt) the one which was created using 'Start 
trace' and 'stop trace'...

Best Regards!

Subject: [Paraview] Multiblock dataset,
 ghost nodes and problem with rendering contours with opacity
Message-ID: <AANLkTikECqO_a1ivcO+HLXJ49i8aNMMKcGs22Tdk1i=L@mail.gmail.com>

Hey experts,

I am using several *.vtr files (as subblocks of the entire domain) and then
use pvd file to load them in paraview.
As I have read in the manual, one needs to use at least one layer of ghost
nodes on each subblock so that paraview can perform operations on any given
dataset of that kind.
So far, everything is fine. However, the problem that I have is very simple
yet annoying. When I use contours to represent the isosurface and then any
opacity value less than 1.0, I can see the boundaries of each subblock on
the contour surface. I have not been successful to fix this problem yet.
Any ideas on how to solve this issue?

Thanks,
Mohamad
PS: Attached, please find one snapshot of the contours + the annoying line
appreaing on the isosurface.

Hi Mohamad,

Did you add a data array "GhostLevels" to specify for each cell its
ghost level ?
It's an unsigned char data array where the values are the depth into
the next block for of each cell.
By that I mean:
- 0 is the cells of the current block
- 1 is the set of cells that share points in the current block and the
neighbor one.

Thank you for your answer, Robert and Sebastien.

I have read the wiki page given by Robert and I understand that I have 
to follow the "Opening multiple files" method because my files are NOT 
times series but they are pieces of the skin of an aircraft, or 
individual 3D CFD blocks. Our CFD software gives one file / block.

I agree with the suggestion of Sebastien: if we select multiple files in 
the OpenFile process, once a reader has been selected for the first 
file, keep this reader and don't ask for the reader type for following 
files, unless their extension is not the same. This would avoid to click 
OK 350 times or more, unless the user has a dataset with 350 different 
file extensions! :-D  

Best regards.

Richard

I have an animation of a filling tank.  I have an integration filter to get
the volume at a particular time-step.  Is there a way to display this number
on the animation so that it updates?  I'm thinking of something similar to
the annotate time filter but that I can use a custom field with, such as
volume or avg fluid velocity.

Thanks in advance.

Hi Fabian,

In 3.10 the file browser by default hides hidden files. You can disable this
by right clicking in the main file list and turning on "Show Hidden Files".

You can change your filter (or add a new one) that outputs a vtkTable
with a single row and column of  a string containing the text you want
to show (look at vtkTimeToTextConvertor) and then in the XML for the
filter add the following hint (same as the "TimeToTextConvertor" in
Servers/ServerManagers/Resources/filters.xml). Now when you apply this
filter, ParaView will display the result as a text in the 3D window.

 <Hints>
       <OutputPort name="Output-0" index="0" type="text" />
</Hints>

Xunlei,

Are you expecting to see the extents setup correctly before hitting
the Apply button the first time? That indeed won't be the case. You'll
have to hit apply and let the actual data-reading happen before the
information will be shown on the "information tab".

Utkarsh,

I believe some time ago I asked something similar regarding the having the
reader making a call to RequestInformation before actually hitting the Apply
button. Paul (Edwards) mentioned modifying the vtkGet/SetMacro to do this
automatically. I tried it briefly and I got something to compile, but it
didn't work and crashed out with segmentation fault. 

Is it possible, in both cases, to achieve this by modifying some of the
lower-level vtk code?

Regards,

Adriano

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView 3.10 RC1 Window Title Not Correct (OS X)
Message-ID: <67520C6F-0A64-4A5E-8F80-7D4ACACC552B@bluequartz.net>

Just compiled the latest ParaView from git (master) and when I launched the app I noticed at the top that it had "32 Bit" in the title. Just to verify my version was actually a 64 bit version. My guess is that when that title is generated in code there should be some preprocessor logic to figure out just how it was built. Relying on the sizeof(void*) probably isn't the best idea:


#if !defined(__APPLE__)
  Compute title for NON Apple Platforms
#else
   # if defined(__LP64__) && __LP64__
	64 BIt title
  # else
	32 bit title
  # endif

#endif

Should I put in a formal bug report?

Thanks

Humm, curious if you doing a universal build then? Yeah please file a bug
and I'll make sure it's fixed for 3.10.0 final.

Yes. I was doing a universal build targeted for 10.5 but using a 10.6 to build. Do you have a hint as to where that title is generated? I'll try and put together a patch.

The bitness comes from ParaViewCommon.cmake around line 280 and passed
into build_paraview_client in Applications/ParaView/CMakeLists.txt  around
line 49. I guess in this case the title should be Universal, what do you
think? I have similar logic that generates the dmg name that way. i.e. if
there are more than one target platforms then call it Darwub-Universal.

I would have thought that some sort of header file would be created with all the preprocessor logic and then the actual Qt code would call out to that header file to get the correct QString to display in the title. Just having "Universal" in the header may or may not be good enough. I think I would really want to know in what mode (32 or 64 bit) it was truly running. Is that what is happening? I am having trouble following exactly where the "TITLE" argument to  the build_paraview_client function is actually being used.

Subject: [Paraview] Clip filter doesn't operate on points
Message-ID: <E1PmV1M-0007I4-MG@cosmos.phy.tufts.edu>

I created a file with a set of points in an unstructured_grid.  Glyph
was happy to display glyphs of the locations of the points.  But when I
wanted to select a subset of the points with Clip, it never passed on
any of them.  Apparently Clip doesn't work with points, but only with
cells.  When I made a vertex at each point, it worked fine.

I can't see any reason why Clip should not work with points, but if
there is at least it should be documented.

Thanks.

In general, many VTK filters, including mappers iterate over cells. So
if you don't create at least single cell consisting of all the points
(a poly-vertex cell), they will be skipped.

Adriano,

I don't believe the two are related. The "Information Tab" is not
directly related to the information produced by the filter in
"RequestInformation". The "Information tab" can be thought of as
information from the dataset generated by the filter. Now the data is
generated only after RequestData(), hence until RequestData() most
information on the information-tab is empty.

Hi Utkarsh,
Then what is the purpose of RequestInformation()? I thought it is 
designed for handling large data set where the metadata can be extracted 
before loading the entire data set.

You are correct, but to be handled by filters downstream in typical
VTK pipeline. In ParaView, we currently have the limitation that once
you hit the first apply, the default representation will ask for full
dataset from the input. There are several new approaches  that are
currently being developed (cc-ing Dave) such as streaming to address
this issue.

Hi Michael,

I guess *.pvtr file solved my problem. However, I have noticed combining all
my *.vtr files via the *.pvrt file, then plotting a contours, it is slower
than just loading it via *.pvd file.
Thanks for the tip though.

What is a .pvd file?
To my knowledge, it is a very useful and powerful file format of paraview
that you can combine several files (as parts) and timesteps, etc into this
file.
This is an example of a *.pvd file that I have that combines multiblock
*.vtr files for several timesteps. It is very handy and simple as I have
learned.
The only problem that I have with this as I mentioned is the ghost nodes
which seem to appear as an extra line when I plot some contours of my
dataset.


<?xml version="1.0"?>
<VTKFile type="Collection" version="0.1" byte_order="LittleEndian"
compressor="vtkZLibDataCompressor">
   <Collection>
     <DataSet timestep="1" group="" part="0" file="Conc_P0_1.vtr"/>
     <DataSet timestep="1" group="" part="1" file="Conc_P1_1.vtr"/>
     <DataSet timestep="2" group="" part="0" file="Conc_P0_2.vtr"/>
     <DataSet timestep="2" group="" part="1" file="Conc_P1_2.vtr"/>
     <DataSet timestep="3" group="" part="0" file="Conc_P0_3.vtr"/>
     <DataSet timestep="3" group="" part="1" file="Conc_P1_3.vtr"/>
 </Collection>
 </VTKFile>

Hi Seb,

I did not define any separate array. The only thing that I have done when
writing the *.vtr file for each subblock is something similar to this

*****************************************************
(And many more datafiles similar to this).
As you can see, the two files have one layer of ghost nodes
File0.vatr
  <RectilinearGrid WholeExtent="0 27 0 68 0 135">
File1.vtr
  <RectilinearGrid WholeExtent="26 54 0 68 0 135">


Now, I use a *.pvd file to load these files as "part" for each timestep. I
am not even using a *.pvtr.
Is it possible to do it the way I am doing it right now or do I need to use
*.pvtr file?

Thanks for you help,
Mohamad

It gets configured into CMake\branded_paraview_initializer.cxx.in as
BPC_TITLE. The configuration magic happens in ParaViewBranding.cmake. The
idea behind the branding code was to make creating generic paraview based
applications easy. I am hesitant about putting the ifdefs at the C++ level
as that would effect everyone using ParaView branded applications.

Hi Richard,

I have fixed the issue with the OpenFile to openly prompt once per file
extension. Unless problems arise I expect to have it in the 3.10 release.

In light of that I would say use the CMake logic that you suggested earlier to put in "Universal" when ParaView is built with multiple Archs. The user can always use the "Get Info" in the OS X Finder to determine how ParaView will be launched.

The idea behind the branding code was to make creating generic paraview based applications easy. I am hesitant about putting the ifdefs at the C++ level as that would effect everyone using ParaView branded applications.

Just having "Universal" in the header may or may not be good enough. I think I would really want to know in what mode (32 or 64 bit) it was truly running. Is that what is happening? I am having trouble following exactly where the "TITLE" argument to  the build_paraview_client function is actually being used.

I guess in this case the title should be Universal, what do you think? I have similar logic that generates the dmg name that way. i.e. if there are more than one target platforms then call it Darwub-Universal.

My guess is that when that title is generated in code there should be some preprocessor logic to figure out just how it was built. Relying on the sizeof(void*) probably isn't the best idea:

Subject: [Paraview] Viewing points of an Unstructured Grid
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=mjbgy+gOM1DMB4hJjbf_+vm=659-tHpdeLF2A@mail.gmail.com>

Hello yall.

I have an unstructured grid with the cells being VTK_LINES. Is there a way
to display only the points of the grid? While there is such an option when
the cells are VTK_TRIANGLES or VTK_TETRA, the same does not work when the
cells are VTK_LINES.

Best Regards,
Panagiotis

Thank you for these good news, Robert. While waiting the final release, 
I can continue my tests on RC1 by gathering my single block files into a 
multi-block Tecplot file or by using VTM files.

Hello.
I can't colorize PointSprite representation by SolidColor.

Subject: [Paraview] Compiling PV-3.10-RC1 with Boost
Message-ID: <6B144650ACCC419E85F9013AF0A7DB56@win.ara>


Dear All,

I'm having an issue getting the new release candidate to compile with boost
on 64-bit linux. I am using boost-1_39_0, however I get the following error
message:

 Your system is using an outdated version of Boost (1.33.1, found in
/usr/local/boost_1_39_0/x86_64/include/boost-1_39).  Some of the graph
 processing filters require version 1.36.0 or later to build on 64-bit
platforms.

 The system will still compile but those filters will be disabled.  Please
see ParaView3/VTK/Infovis/CMakeLists.txt for more information.

It appears to think the version of Boost I am pointing to is only v1.33.1
when it is v1.39.0. I have tried with other versions with the same issue.
Could this be an issue with the Cmake?

Regards,

Adriano

Hi Adriano, what options are you setting to enable boost? Just VTK_USE_BOOST
and then setting Boost_INCLUDE_DIR?

Hi Mohamad,

I thought you were working on an unstructured grid. As it is not the
case you shouldn't bother with the array that I talked earlier.
But you should provide the information that each piece is a part of a
whole system and not a set of whole system shown in the same 3d world.

Did you try to specify the WholeExtent to be the Whole system extent
and not the piece one ?

Seb

Hi David,
 
I have:
 
VTK_USE_BOOST = ON
Boost_INCLUDE_DIR = /path/boost_1_39_0/x86_64/include/boost-1_39
Boost_LIBRARY_DIR = /path/boost_1_39_0/x86_64/lib
VTK_USE_PARALLEL_BGL = OFF
 
That is all the options I have actively set for Boost.
 
Cheers,
 
Adriano

It appears to think the version of Boost I am pointing to is only v1.33.1

Could this be an issue with the Cmake?

Subject: [Paraview] 3.10.0-RC1: state file unreadeable when a Text source
 contains the degree symbol
Message-ID: <4D516D36.2070100@onera.fr>

Hello.

Here is a minor problem with Text sources in PV 3.10.0-RC1. When adding 
a Text source in the 3D view with the "degree" symbol "?" (SHIFT right 
parenthesis on the french keyboard) and saving the pvsm state file, the 
state file becomes unreadable. Following is the error message:
>
> ERROR: In 
> /home/kitware/Kitware/ParaView-3.10/source/VTK/IO/vtkXMLParser.cxx, 
> line 483
>
> vtkPVXMLParser (0x170ad620): Error parsing XML in stream at line 
> 16051, column 58, byte index 749627: not well-formed (invalid token)
>
> Root does not exist. Either state file could not be opened or it does 
> not contain valid xml
>
Here is a part of the saved pvsm file about the Text source:
>     <Proxy group="sources" type="TextSource" id="4875" servers="1">
>       <Property name="Text" id="4875.Text" number_of_elements="1">
>         <Element index="0" value="Plan x = 30 - Angle = 15?"/>
>       </Property>
>     </Proxy>
Removing the "?" symbol following "15" makes the file readable.
Other special characters (letters with accents such as ? or ? ) don't 
have such a problem.

Regards.

Hi Seb,

Did you try to specify the WholeExtent to be the Whole system extent
and not the piece one ?

Yes I did, but it does not seem to be correct. Some wiggles appear on the
contour of the first partition of the dataset.
In both *.vtr files I changed the line as:
<RectilinearGrid WholeExtent="0 54 0 68 0 135">

But no luck!

Do you think the only way that it is gonna work is to first create *.pvtr
file for each time step and then use a *.pvd file to load all the
timesteps?

Thanks in advance,
Mohamad

Subject: [Paraview] selecting points on a 3d image
Message-ID: <8B2644FE-0D77-4469-9AA7-B91486010B8B@u.washington.edu>

Hello,

I am attempting to use Paraview to display a 3d image (uniform  
rectilinear grid) and select landmark points on an object in the  
image.  Is there an easy way to do this, or does Paraview not support  
this?

The cell selection tool does not seem to be working on the image.  I  
can create a contour from the object in the image and select points  
from here, but the coordinates are different and I am not clear on  
what the transformation between them is.

Thanks,
Sara

Hello,

I think I'm narrowing down where my confusion is coming from.  I have  
tried using the selection inspector to select points by choosing the  
3d coordinates (which is not exactly what I'm trying to do).  However,  
the coordinate values don't correspond to the image size.  The image  
should be 128x128x128.  These coordinates seem to be 508x508x296.  Can  
someone explain how to get the point locations in the space of the  
original image, or show me where to look for this?

thanks,
Sara

To followup a bit, attached are two images of the issue I am seeing.

The two-lobe rendering (from another package) is correct.
The single lobe that is rendered with ParaView is incorrect.

And if somebody would be kind enough to download the sample data and 
verify what I am seeing:

http://pages.swcp.com/~goldman/data/farfield/farfield.xmf.zip 
<http://pages.swcp.com/%7Egoldman/data/farfield/farfield.xmf.zip>

And/or if anybody knowledgeable on the xdmf or paraview source code can 
suggest an area of the code to look at, I can dig in to figure out 
what's going on.

thanks,
Jon

Oops, I should have re-titled this email.

What I meant to say, is the images in the previous email are showing one 
of the issues I have been seeing with the data set. I recently pulled 
and rebuilt ParaView from source and things are better:
a) It is not crashing with this data set;  yay!
b) Not displaying those crazy bounds - though sometimes it loads and 
does not show anything;
c) And I think I saw on the git log that Utkarsh fixed a crashing bug 
when a xdmf temporal collection had no time step specified (so thanks 
Utkarsh! and whoever else fixed bugs :-)

Subject: [Paraview] 3.10.0-RC1 volumne clipping - or mouse problems
Message-ID: <7EFC2F0287E84A52B74EEE5DB21F3C18@notebook>

Hi,

I'd just like to point out an issue with 3.10.0-RC1.

I have a volume data set of a mouse which works fine in 3.8. I've just tried
it in 3.10.0-RC1 on both Linux and Windows and I see the top and bottom of
the mouse being clipped. If I switch to GPU the clipping disappears.

Attached is a screenshot showing the left and right data missing. 

Sometimes when it is first loaded it is complete but any movement makes it
clip.

I tried both a *.vti file of the data and loading it again as *.raw with the
same results.

Cheers,

Hi all,

I've downloaded 3.10RC1 today and tried to visualise vectors from point Data as I'm used to do in v 3.8.1, but the drop down menu for selecting Vectors is not working.
Just reporting, hope it will help.

Hi again,

Sorry about this previous email, it seems to work at the end.
I've closed the view, open another one and reloaded the data and this time it worked. The vector field appears in the drop down menu.
Odd, maybe something wrong with the cache on my machine, though.

Guillaume

Subject: [Paraview] ClipPolyData
Message-ID: <5687944.720471297242639128.JavaMail.defaultUser@defaultHost>

 Hello,

I have a 3D portion of kidney: a membrane and cells on its surface.
What I have to do is to determine the area of competence of each cells, that
is to calculate the points of the surface nearer to each cells and then
determine the value of the area formed of these points.
Cells, obviously, are a group of points.
I have calculated the barycentre of each cells and I have calculated the
distance between barycentres and points of surface.
I have created a list called 'ids' with an id for each points of surface; the
id refers to the barycentre nearer to the point.
Example: ids = [ 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 2, 1, 1, ....]  length(ids)=number
of points of surface
Then I have created an array that permits to associate a different color to
each id. In paraview I can visualize the surface with the areas of competence
of each cells with differents color.

I have done a test with one barycentre.
I have create a new list called 'ids_new' and I have associated to the points
nearer to the barycentre 0 id 0 and to the other points id 1.
In Paraview I have apllied the Clip filter with a scalar between 0 and 1,
which gives only the points with id 0 and with the filter integrateVariables I
have found the value of the area.

Now, I need to do this thing many time because I have 4 surfaces and about 200
cells for each surface.
So I think the best way is to do that by python code.

I'm not so practice of python and vtk so I ask you an help.
How can I insert in my code the part of vtkClipPolyData? I have some errors. I
can't find the way to say to the code to use a scalar instead of a function.

And then, is there any way to calculate the area from the code?
Better, is there any way to do what Paraview does with the IntegrateVariables
in python code?


Thank's

Subject: [Paraview] LIC surface Color by variable lost on Screenshot with
 offscreen rendering
Message-ID: <4D525D22.8000304@onera.fr>

Hello.

I found a screenshot problem with LIC in PV 3.10.0-RC, but this problem 
already existed in PV 3.8.

I have a multiblock surface with a friction vector and a pressure 
variable. I color the surface by the pressure variable and I use the LIC 
representation with the friction vector.

When I take a screenshot while the option "Use offscreen rendering for 
screenshots" is checked (this is the default option), the LIC 
representation is OK but the color by the pressure variable is lost, and 
each block has a different solid color. If I uncheck the offscreen 
rendering, I get the expected screenshot with the LIC representation 
colored by the pressure variable.

Following are two screenshots with and without offscreen rendering for a 
simple example: the dataset contains two structured blocks in a Tecplot 
file for a rectangular wing. The dataset has a pressure variable dCp 
from a vortex lattice CFD method, and I used the Calculator filter to 
construct a pseudo friction vector (iHat + 0.25*jHat) to be used by the 
LIC plugin.

Regards.

Hello,

I downloaded the ParaView-3.10.0-RC1-Linux-x86_64.tar.gz and try to

Could the file have been corrupted?

Hi Florian,

I just downloaded and extracted the Linux 64bit binary without issue. Have
you tried re-downloading it or tried downloading and extracting on
a different machine? Has anyone else on the list had problems extracting the

I used the tar.gz download to obtain the RC without issue. Sounds like a
broken download. I'd check to make sure the tarball size is approximately
373MB.

That is strange issue. Maybe a reinstall of firefox will resolve the issue?
At least you have it now!

I already downloaded several times and tried on three machines with two

Ah, just downloades again with IE instead of firefox. Seem to work now.
Still no idea why...

Also please we need to deal with visualization software does not depend on

Hi Gamal,

ParaView runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux and can be built with or without
MPI/parallel support as well as without cygwin on Windows.  Installers are
available at http://paraview.org/paraview/resources/software.html along with
build information at
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView_Binaries#ParaView-3.10.0.

As for the WRF output, I'm assuming you're talking about the "Weather
Research and Forecasting" code.  What have you tried loading so far?  I'm
not exactly sure about the output files but ParaView can handle some NetCDF
files.  Can you send a small sample input file to test if ParaView can read
it?
Andy

Subject: [Paraview] Problem with probe location
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=NsagSUjjfH1A5U5=woJ3SZDAdJeHP-cEU2bAf@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm getting incorrect results from probe location as the tolerance seems to
be very lenient.  My datasets are multiblock containing volumes and
surfaces.  The point probe is matching the surfaces as well as the volume
when the point is quite far away the surface (and confusing my users!)

You can see how high the tolerance is by creating a Wavelet source (all
default values) and then using the "ProbeLocation" filter at point (10.9, 0,
0)  - this is quite far out of the volume but it still returns a valid
match.

I've looked in vtkProbeFilter (vtkProbeFilter::ProbeEmptyPoints) and notice
that the tolerance is set to:

    diagonal_length_squared / 1000

Could we change this to?:

   diagonal_length_squared / 1000000

Thanks,
Paul

Hi Andy,

Thanks so much for your quick reply.
Yes I mean Weather Research and Forecasting and its output is?NetCDF but?does 
not like regular NetCDF.
I opened it by POP Ocean NetCDF(Rectilinear) and saw all the meteorological 
variables?but I can't?reach to the desired output display.
Please I need to see like the following website:
http://www.kitware.com/products/html/DesktopVisualizationOfMeteorologicalDataUsingParaView.html


I can't send it because it is very big to attach.

With my kind regards
Gamal

Subject: [Paraview] Clip polygonal data?
In-Reply-To: <124876.26937.qm@web113419.mail.gq1.yahoo.com>
	(gamalafandy@yahoo.com)
Message-ID: <E1PnE36-0007FL-Lr@cosmos.phy.tufts.edu>

I'm trying to visualize some strings.  I have them as a polygonal mesh
containing my set of points and each string represented as a polyline
going through all its points.  Then I visualize the strings with the
Tube filter, which works great and looks beautiful.

But now I'm trying to extract only part of my volume.  It looks like
Clip is the filter for this, but Clip returns unstructured grid data,
on which Tube does not operate.  Also Clip disconnects my strings
into individual lines connecting the points in pairs.  

Is there a solution?  I'm not picky about what happens at the edge of
my volume.  For example I'd be happy for it to keep only the parts of
the polylines that connect points inside the volume.

Thanks.

                                        Ken

Hi Gamal,

I'm having trouble understanding what exactly you want to do.  There are a
variety of visualizations in that article (contours, streamlines, slice
planes, etc.).  What filters are you using to try to visualize your data?
If you're just beginning to use ParaView you may want to go through the
tutorial that Ken Moreland put together (
http://paraview.org/Wiki/The_ParaView_Tutorial).

I think the easiest way would be to use the calculator filter.  For a
rotation around the z axis and centered at (0,0,0) you could use
"coordsY*iHat-coordsX*jHat".

Hi Andy and Gamal,

I guess what Gamal is looking for is a tutorial on how to read/import
WRF output data into paraview. As he mentioned the netcdf format used
by WRF is not a standard one.

Subject: [Paraview] Saving Images
Message-ID: <4D5305A3.60708@slac.stanford.edu>

Hi.

I've had some surprising results when saving images out of ParaView.  I 
haven't had time to thoroughly examine results by looking at difference 
images until recently.  Here's what I found.

When I carefully size the ParaView 3D view to, say 1280x960, and then 
"File->Save Screenshot", the view looks the same.  Comparing this with a 
screenshot taken from gimp (with the rest of the gui carefully cropped 
away), I find that the view is the same.  There are some pixel 
differences along thin edges, but this should be acceptable, because the 
way the saved image is rendered might not be the same way as the screen 
image is rendered.  But the view is the same.

I do encounter problems, however, when I adjust the pixel resolution for 
saving a screenshot.  If I double the resolution to 2560x1080, and then 
average that back down and compare it with the 1280x960 saved image, I 
would expect pixel differences where thin lines average down to slightly 
different antialiased colors.  However, the actual view changes as well 
(zooms in), so What I See Isn't What I get.  The view changes further if 
I save out at 3x the original resolution (doesn't match 1x or 2x).  
Again, I'd expect to see pixel differences from different anti aliasing, 
but the view itself shouldn't change (no zoom/pan/rotate).

So then I investigated saving an animation frame.  Although I wouldn't 
expect this to match the gimp screenshot for the same reasons that the 
1x "save screenshot" image didn't, I would expect it to match the 1x 
screenshot.  But it doesn't.  Furthermore, animation frames at 2x, and 
3x also don't match 1x in that the view changes (zoom is different).   
The change in zoom seems consistent with the change in zoom from "save 
screenshot" for 1x, 2x, and 3x.  I think that the correct thing would be 
to have all zooms match each other, regardless of pixel resolution (at 
least, for the same aspect ratio images).

It makes sense to me that the zoom changes would be consistent between 
"save screenshot" and "save animation", because I would expect the same 
routine to do the saving.  However, I was suprised to find pixel 
differences between the 1x versions, the 2x versions, and the 3x 
versions.  I would expect these to be, pixel-for-pixel strictly 
identical.  To my eye, I haven't seen any obvious differences.  But 
theoretically, shouldn't each 1x pair be identical?  Same for 2x with 
each other, and 3x with each other?

Another odd thing is that "save screenshot" defaults to the resolution 
of the 3d view.  But, for some reason, "save animation" for a 1280x960 
3d view defaults to 1259x944.   I can understand automatic tweaking of 
animation frame resolutions so that they're nice multiples of 16 or 32 
or whatever makes video codecs happiest.   But in this case, 1280x960 is 
already a perfect multiple.

It would be really nice if all methods of saving images were consistent 
with respect to view (zoom/pan/rotate).  It's frustrating to try piecing 
movies and transitions together from animations and screenshots, only to 
have them not align due to these inconsistencies.  It's also tedious to 
constantly have to fix the pixel resolution when saving animations 
because the default doesn't match the 3d view and the save screenshot 
resolution.  It's also frustrating to have a 3d view with the correct 
aspect ratio, compose a nice scene, save it out, have it approved, and 
then come back to generate a high resolution version and find the edges 
of the model cropped off because the zoom changed out from under me.

All the above behavior was in 3.11.0, 64 bit, checked out a couple days 
ago, and compiled on Fedora 14.  I apologize for so much text, but 
because these seem related to me, I figured it made sense to keep them 
together.

Any thoughts?

Thanks.

Greg

Subject: [Paraview] Scripting and new VTK objects
Message-ID: <55826515.12766.1297286451345.JavaMail.root@mail2.gatech.edu>

Hi,

I've searched online at length for this and couldn't find the answer, so hopefully somebody here can help me.

I am trying to create a new VTK object (vtkMultiBlockDataSet) composed of portions of manipulated data from some other VTK object (in this case, a vtkStructuredGrid). I then want to delete the vtkStructuredGrid object and visualize the new vtkMultiBlockDataSet. 

So, here's the general outline of what I do in a python script:

newSource = DataGeneratorObject(Program="MB{}")
newSource.UpdatePipeline()

newData = servermanager.Fetch(newSource)
newData.SetNumberOfBlocks(64)

for n in range(0,64):
    myData = XDMFReader(FileName=...)
    myData.UpdatePipeline()
    
    localData = servermanager.Fetch(myData)
    
    <manipulate the data>

    newData.SetBlock(n,vtk.vtkStructuredGrid())
    newData.GetBlock(n).DeepCopy(localData)

    Delete(localData)
    Delete(myData)

newData.DataHasBeenGenerated()
newSource.UpdatePipelineInformation()
newSource.UpdatePipeline()

With all that done, if I try to apply a filter to newSource, it doesn't work. The data is definitely inside newData -- I can print it out and such, even after I delete the localData (which is why I used DeepCopy). 

But I don't know how to send that data back to the server. Or, maybe I don't need the DataObjectGenerator -- if that's the case, how do I create a local VTK object and then send it to the server to visualize? 

Hopefully that example is clear... I appreciate any help you guys can provide. It would be easiest if I could create my own custom reader, but I can't do that because we use Paraview on a lot of machines that we can't recompile to include the new plugin. 

Thanks,

Tim

Hi Tim,

Have you looked at the python programmable source?  With the python
programmable source you can specify python code to run on the server side.
You won't be able to use paraview python api though.  Instead of

XDMFReader(FileName=...)

it would look like:

reader = vtkXDMFReader()
reader.SetFileName(...)
reader.Update()
data = reader.GetOutput()

You can find examples of the python programmable source:

We had looked at the programmable source, but we didn't know how to access the XDMFReader. But, with what you pointed out, it looks like that isn't hard so I'll give it a shot. 

Out of curiosity, what is wrong with the approach I was trying? Is it possible to completely copy information from one source in a pipeline into another source in a pipeline and delete the original source? Why does Fetch() show data inside the DataObjectGenerator but no filter can seem to access it? 

Thanks for the help,

Hi Tim, 

Have you looked at the python programmable source? With the python programmable source you can specify python code to run on the server side. You won't be able to use paraview python api though. Instead of 

XDMFReader(FileName=...) 

it would look like: 

reader = vtkXDMFReader() 
reader.SetFileName(...) 
reader.Update() 
data = reader.GetOutput() 

You can find examples of the python programmable source:

Hi, 

I've searched online at length for this and couldn't find the answer, so hopefully somebody here can help me. 

I am trying to create a new VTK object (vtkMultiBlockDataSet) composed of portions of manipulated data from some other VTK object (in this case, a vtkStructuredGrid). I then want to delete the vtkStructuredGrid object and visualize the new vtkMultiBlockDataSet. 

So, here's the general outline of what I do in a python script: 

newSource = DataGeneratorObject(Program="MB{}") 
newSource.UpdatePipeline() 

newData = servermanager.Fetch(newSource) 
newData.SetNumberOfBlocks(64) 

for n in range(0,64): 
myData = XDMFReader(FileName=...) 
myData.UpdatePipeline() 

localData = servermanager.Fetch(myData) 

<manipulate the data> 

newData.SetBlock(n,vtk.vtkStructuredGrid()) 
newData.GetBlock(n).DeepCopy(localData) 

Delete(localData) 
Delete(myData) 

newData.DataHasBeenGenerated() 
newSource.UpdatePipelineInformation() 
newSource.UpdatePipeline() 

With all that done, if I try to apply a filter to newSource, it doesn't work. The data is definitely inside newData -- I can print it out and such, even after I delete the localData (which is why I used DeepCopy). 

But I don't know how to send that data back to the server. Or, maybe I don't need the DataObjectGenerator -- if that's the case, how do I create a local VTK object and then send it to the server to visualize? 

Hopefully that example is clear... I appreciate any help you guys can provide. It would be easiest if I could create my own custom reader, but I can't do that because we use Paraview on a lot of machines that we can't recompile to include the new plugin. 

Thanks, 

Tim

Maybe I'm missing something, but if I 

from paraview import vtk 

there is no vtkXDMFReader in it. The only vtkX* is vtkXML related. It was even compiled with XDMF_WRAP_PYTHON turned on, so maybe it's there but called something else?

We had looked at the programmable source, but we didn't know how to access the XDMFReader. But, with what you pointed out, it looks like that isn't hard so I'll give it a shot. 

Out of curiosity, what is wrong with the approach I was trying?

Paraview does not import the complete vtk python modules when you run that.
Try this:

import libvtkXdmfPython as xm
xm.vtkXdmfReader()

or try import vtkXdmfPython instead of libvtkXdmfPython, the name is
different on different platforms and versions.

What you are doing to the DataObjectGenerator and Fetch command isn't going
to work out.  Fetch is creating a copy, it's not giving you access to the
real data object.

Here is a trick you can do, it only works if you are running paraview with a
builtin server.  A real, true builtin server, not the fancy new mpi builtin
server.  When client and server share the same memory space, you can use
GetClientSideObject() to get the "server side" vtk object belonging to a
paraview object.

mb = get_manipulated_vtkmultiblock_from_someplace()

t = TrivialProducer()
filter = t.GetClientSideObject()  # filter is a vtkTrivialProducer
filter.SetOutput(mb)
t.UpdatePipeline()

Now you can attach paraview filters to the trivial producer.

If there isn't a reader that's already doing what you need then you'll need
to import it yourself into paraview.  Information on that is on the wiki at
http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView#Importing_Data . If any of the vtkNetCDF*
readers are close to what you want you it's probably easiest to just build
off of those.  You can do a search for those readers at
http://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classes.html

I opened it by POP Ocean NetCDF(Rectilinear) and saw all the meteorological 
variables?but I can't?reach to the desired output display.
Gamal
?

If there isn't a reader that's already doing what you need then you'll need to 
import it yourself into paraview.? Information on that is on the wiki at 
http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView#Importing_Data . If any of the vtkNetCDF* 
readers are close to what you want you it's probably easiest to just build off 
of those.? You can do a search for those readers at 
http://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classes.html

If you have the data in paraview already then I think you'll need to go
through the paraview tutorial that I linked to earlier and spend a bit of
time getting more familiar with paraview.  This will help get you familiar
with the pipeline concepts and views among other things in order to process
the data in your desired fashion.

I also have some issues with the screenshot, on Windows.
I have to move the window that asks where to save the file outside of the
display window of Paraview. Otherwise it is over the picture.

Hello, Utkarsh.

The screenshots I have sent have been made with 
PV-3.10.0-RC1-Linux-x86_64 on CentOS 5.5.

I performed the same screenshot test with PV 3.8.1 on Windows Vista, but 
I had not this color problem, neither the window over picture problem of 
Aur?lien Marsan.

I will install PV-3.10.0-RC1 on my Vista laptop and perform the same 
test later.

Subject: [Paraview] Python questions
Message-ID: <4D53BF65.7050700@epcc.ed.ac.uk>

Hello,

We are attempting to use Paraview to visualise some data from a 
simulation. At present we have a standalone Python script that converts 
the data into a legacy VTK file which Paraview can read. Ideally we'd 
like to integrate the script into Paraview as a programmable source so 
that the data can be imported directly.

I have got the script running inside Paraview, but have encountered two 
problems and wondered if anyone knew how to avoid them:


1. The data is in the form of a vtkStructuredGrid. However the grid 
produced by the script won't display in Paraview and the information tab 
says it contains 0 points and 0 cells. (If the same data is written out 
to a VTK file and read in from there, it displays fine). We found this 
bug report:

http://public.kitware.com/Bug/view.php?id=2974

which suggests this behaviour is the result of a bug in VTK. Does anyone 
know if there is a workaround which would allow us to create a valid 
structured grid object from Python?


2. We would like to pop up a file selection dialog when the script runs 
instead of having the input filename hard-coded into it. According to 
this message:

http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2010-April/017010.html

it should be possible to access PyQt functionality from within Paraview. 
However when I run the minimal example from the message it crashes 
Paraview. Does anyone know if there is something else I need to do to 
make this work? I'm aware it's not officially supported, but if someone 
has managed to do it I'd be interested to hear from them.


I'm running ParaView 3.8.1, built from source on Windows XP using Visual 
Studio 2008. I have Qt 4.7.1 and Python 2.6 with PyQt installed.

Many thanks,
James

Hello James

I don't believe this is a bug. I have  used the ProgrammableSource and was able to render a grid without any difficulty. What is missing in your procedure is most likely setting the WholeExtent.


try loading this script and you'll get a rendered image

paraview --script=state.py

Utkarsh,

I have performed the same screenshot tests on Windows Vista 32 bits with 
PV 3.10.0-RC1. No problem. The picture is always as expected, with the 
LIC representation being colored by the pressure variable in bot cases, 
offscreen rendering checked or unchecked. So the LIC color by variable 
seems to be lost only with Linux.

If this may help you, I noticed something on the 3D view on Vista when I 
take a screenshot while offscreen rendering is checked: the LIC color by 
variable is lost for a short time, each block getting a different solid 
color, then the LIC color by variable comes back on the dataset, and the 
saved picture is colored by variable as expected. So the problem in 
Linux could be some kind of time delay, the picture being saved while 
the 3D view is changing to solid color?

Richard

Subject: [Paraview] extract location of minimum
Message-ID: <AANLkTimYzihJDiqwzVnWc_+Yqbtay9_jV5Gbbk+xnhFh@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Paraviewers,

I would like to extract the location of a minimum value from a data set in
pvbatch

I were able to find the value of the minimum with



       mm=MinMax(Uzcomponent)
       mm.Operation="MIN"
       mindata=sm.Fetch(Uzcomponent,mm,mm)
       mindata.GetPointData().GetNumberOfArrays()
       a0 = mindata.GetPointData().GetArray(1)
       a1 = mindata.GetScalar()
       print "name 1: ", a0.GetName()
       print "tuple1: ", a0.GetTuple1(0)

Here, a0.GetTyple1 give me the value of the minimum

However: How do I find the location of this value ?

Any hint appriciate!

Regards

Eelco

The min max filter unfortunately doesn't keep track of which tuple and
processor it found the min in so you can't get back to the particular
point or cell it came from.

Instead of using fetch and minmax, try using a values selection. Set
the value to be that minimum value. Once you extract the selection and
fetch it to the client, you get a copy of the actuall cell(s)/point(s)
that have the minimum value and you can query them directly for their
spatial location.

Subject: [Paraview] Plotting line data on the surface of a sphere
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=DOqeSvLKMt9OLq+ww98MiVuzyvnd2+Rkbch8q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I am plotting a spherical data volume using structuredgrid.  I also
want to plot line data on the surface of the sphere.  Presently the
line data (list of points) is in an x y multisegment GMT format (i.e.
lat lon)

(1) A crude hack is to mesh the line data and then contour.  This
won't look great and is highly dependent on the resolution of the
mesh.
(2) Use the python filter.  Problem is, consecutive points don't
necessary join to each other (i.e. this is the reason for the
multi-segment -m option in GMT).

Any advice much appreciated.

Thanks,

Dan

Subject: [Paraview] pvserver disconnecting...
Message-ID: <AANLkTik82uwvy_cCRj32RzmMbxLUP-jTsLEzTRtdaGff@mail.gmail.com>

I'm pretty new to paraview so could be doing fundamentally wrong here, but
here's my issue...

I have paraview 3.10 compiled/installed from source on Ubuntu 10. I'm using
a python script to connect to pvserver, iterate over a bunch of vtk files,
do some stuff, and saving the output as a png. I'm running the python script
and the pvserver on the same (8-core) machine.

So I start pvserver with (e.g.) mpirun -np 6 pvserver and it sits happily
listening for a client. In another terminal, I run my python script which
connects (successfully) to pvserver, and starts running through the files
exactly as I ask it to. So far so good.

Problem is, after a random length of time, and/or number of files, the
pvserver abruptly dies and so the whole python script obviously dies with
it. The pvserver gives no error message... just dies. If I just run the
script for one file (or even a few of them), it runs without an issue.

What I have noticed is that the less processors I use, the more files my
script will process before pvserver dies. If I use pvserver by itself (i.e.
one processor) it will do about 120-or-so files. If I use four processors,
it'll only go through 30-or-so before one of them throws a kill signal and
takes the whole thing down. It is not a particular file that does it, nor is
it at a particular point in the processing script. The length of time and
number of files processed is also not fixed. (It's almost like it's a memory
leak issue..??)

So... questions:
1) Am I being inefficient/stupid by using pvserver + python script to do
this batch processing? If so, what's the recommended practice?
2) My script only does one server connect (via Connect('localhost') ) and
then loops over the files. Should I do a new server connect for each file
instead?
3) Assuming yes to question 2, how do I cleanly disconnect from pvserver
without killing the server altogether (see below)?
4) If I run a single instance of file processing (i.e. one file) the script
runs fine... but when it's done, the pvserver disconnects the client and
dies. Is that normal? Is there a 'keep-alive' flag for pvserver? Why does
dropping the connection kill the server?
5) Does pvserver leave any logs anywhere? Anyway I can trace what's causing
the kill signal?

I just can't shake the feeling that the pvserver process should be a lot
more robust than what I'm seeing.

Many thanks for any help!

Hi Karl,

It sounds like a memory leak problem.  Have you tried opening the System
Monitor in ubuntu and watching the memory usage of pvserver as you run your
script?  Can you post your script so we can take a look at it, maybe you
aren't cleaning up after you process each file?

You can pass --cslog=log.txt to pvserver.  This records very low level log
information, it captures every message sent to the server.  Problem is that
it does not work very well for a parallel server, all processes all write to
the same file.

pvserver exits when the client disconnects and there is no keep-alive flag.
Try running pvserver in a bash loop, or starting it from your python script.

Pat

Message-ID: <AANLkTi=WNySABwHGpUWraq6RU+8WkfSwW3ZQMETXzopB@mail.gmail.com>

Just curious if anyone has any experience setting up a Paraview server on
Amazon's EC2 platform. I have compiled VTK a few times in the past, but I am
spinning my wheels trying to square away offscreen rendering and parallel
processing. I know this doesn't necessarily need to relate to EC2, but I am
wondering if someone has some pre-made images floating around, or some tips.
Thanks.

David,
 
Have you had time to look at this yet? If not, I should get a chance today
to scour the CMakeLists.txt files to see if the issue lies there. Notably, I
have tried it with 4 64-bit installs of boost now (1_36_0 to 1_39_0) and
CMake reports finding version 1.33.1 each time.
 
Regards,
 
Adriano

Hi Adriano, what options are you setting to enable boost? Just VTK_USE_BOOST
and then setting Boost_INCLUDE_DIR?

Dear All,

I'm having an issue getting the new release candidate to compile with boost
on 64-bit linux. I am using boost-1_39_0, however I get the following error
message:

 Your system is using an outdated version of Boost (1.33.1, found in
/usr/local/boost_1_39_0/x86_64/include/boost-1_39).  Some of the graph
 processing filters require version 1.36.0 or later to build on 64-bit
platforms.

 The system will still compile but those filters will be disabled.  Please
see ParaView3/VTK/Infovis/CMakeLists.txt for more information.

It appears to think the version of Boost I am pointing to is only v1.33.1
when it is v1.39.0. I have tried with other versions with the same issue.
Could this be an issue with the Cmake?

Regards,

Adriano

Hi Pat,

Yes -- I should have gone with my first suspicion. It is indeed a memory
leak. I'm obviously not cleaning stuff up properly... which doesn't surprise
me because my script really is kind of a hack... I have attached it.
Basically it reads a directory of vtk files, loops over each, volume-renders
them with a fixed set of camera positions, and then saves a png.

One issue I was having was getting paraview to "forget" about the previous
vtk file. It was rendering each new image over the top of the previous one.
I fixed that by using Initialize( ) on the different views at the end of the
loop, but that is perhaps (probably!) not the right way to do it.

Many thanks for your help!

Regards,
Karl

Out of curiosity, why would you want to disable the message? It's only
shown when pvpython is run as an interactive session, never when a
script argument is specified or with pvbatch.

I receive the message when executing a Python script with pvpython or
pvbatch after 'from paraview.simple import *'. Whether I run it as:

pvpython ./my-script.py 
pvbatch ./my-script.py

or if I include the executable at the top of the Python script ie:
#!/usr/bin/env pvpython or #!/usr/bin/env pvbatch

I still get the message. Is there another way I should be executing the
scripts?

That's odd.  Maybe you have something in your pythonrc or pythonstartup that
is defining sys.ps1.  Try adding this before the import paraview line in
your script:

import sys
del sys.ps1

Hi David,

Thanks for you suggestion, I got much closer to what I want, but not quite
yet. I have the feeling I need one slight extra hint :)

To obtain the position of a minimun value I now do the script below: I get
the mimimum value first with MinMax, then I Threshold the original data on a
range between min and 0.9*min (the minimum values are negative), then I use
the calculator to get the x and y position of this range, and then I use the
DescriptiveStatitics filter to get the average mean of the position. I can
even use Fetch again to obtain the data, but now the very last step: how to
I get the mean data itself ? Sorry, I just don't understand how that
data.objects exactly work, and there is not much assessible documentation on
it.

I hope you can give me one last hint

Regards

Eelco

      mm=MinMax(Uzcomponent)
      mm.Operation="MIN"
      mindata=sm.Fetch(Uzcomponent,mm,mm)
      mindata.GetPointData().GetNumberOfArrays()
      a0 = mindata.GetPointData().GetArray(1)
      uzname=a0.GetName()
      uzmin=a0.GetTuple1(0)
      print "minimum of %s found: %g\n "%(uzname,uzmin)

      Threshold1 = Threshold(Uzcomponent)
      Threshold1.Scalars=['POINTS',uzname]
      Threshold1.ThresholdRange=[uzmin,0.9*uzmin]

      CalcPos = Calculator()
      CalcPos.AttributeMode = 'point_data'
      CalcPos.Function = 'iHat*coordsX+jHat*coordsY+kHat*coordsZ'
      CalcPos.ResultArrayName = 'MinPos'

      DescriptiveStatistics1 = DescriptiveStatistics()
      DescriptiveStatistics1.VariablesofInterest = ['MinPos']
      statistics=sm.Fetch(DescriptiveStatistics1)

Subject: [Paraview] Remote Rendering problems
Message-ID: <61E2B416E503D24981080ECBF51E454B03CDA9D7@CINMLVEM12.e2k.ad.ge.com>

Hello,

  I'm seeing that an issue with remote rendering, both with ParaView 3.8.1
as well as the new 3.10.0-rc1.  The issue is a minor annoyance with 3.8.1,
but with 3.10.0-rc1, remote rendering is completely unusable for me.  Please
see the attached screenshots.

pv-local.png shows a dataset as it "should" look.  I see this view whenever
I'm running "locally", without connecting to a pvserver instance.  I also
see this view when my data size is less than the "Remote Render Threshold"
setting amount.  If I use a pvserver (running either on my local host, or a
remote server), as soon as the remote renderer is engaged, the view is no
longer "crisp" and the colors become saturated (in the case of 3.8.1), or
becomes just a green screen (3.10.0-rc1).

This happens with both Win32 and Linux builds, both downloaded binaries and
self-compiled (on Linux, at least).

Has anybody else seen this?  What can I do to help track down what is
causing this issue?

Thanks,
Branden

Adriano,

In your original posting you mentioned a pretty old version string:

     paraview version 3.7.0, Date: 2009-10-03

According to 'git blame
Utilities/VTKPythonWrapping/paraview/servermanager.py' the condition to
merely display the version string in interactive mode got added only
later than that, almost three months later: 2009-12-29. Before, it got
displayed unconditionally.

That's odd.  Maybe you have something in your pythonrc or pythonstartup that
is defining sys.ps1.  Try adding this before the import paraview line in
your script:

import sys
del sys.ps1

I still get the message. Is there another way I should be executing the

Out of curiosity, why would you want to disable the message? It's only shown
when pvpython is run as an interactive session, never when a script argument
is specified or with pvbatch.

Hi,

Your loop is leaking readers.   At the end of your loop, call
Delete(reader).  The Delete() function is analogous to selecting an object
in the paraview gui and pressing the delete key.  You'll still leak some
objects, there are more thorough ways you cleanup, but deleting the reader
make take care of the bulk of it.  You can remove the Initialize() calls.

Subject: [Paraview] Precisions about Surface Flow Filter
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=vHerKSSi+acDVCJkOHLmDNWe=Y4QumdVSEMKZ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

Using the surface flow filter, I get results that are not those expected.
Could you give me some informations about how the integration is performed ?


Is this a "local" approach, computing the surface of each face, and doing
some point data to face data interpolation ?

Thanks,

Aur?lien.

Interesting. I've seen these kinds of issues when using RemoteDesktop
or VNC. Are you using either by any chance?

Pat,

Ah! That makes sense now I think about it.

So I put the call at the end of my routine, and it pukes after the first
file:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "script.py", line 52, in <module>
    Delete(reader)
  File "/usr/local/lib/paraview-3.11/paraview/simple.py", line 367, in
Delete
    servermanager.UnRegister(proxy)
  File "/usr/local/lib/paraview-3.11/paraview/servermanager.py", line 2674,
in UnRegister
    raise RuntimeError, "UnRegistration error."
RuntimeError: UnRegistration error.

Thanks again,
~~Karl

The easiest way to answer this is to show the code. Below is what it
does for triangles. You can find what it does for other polygon types
in here:

http://paraview.org/gitweb?p=ParaView.git;a=blob_plain;f=Servers/Filters/vtkIntegrateAttributes.cxx;hb=HEAD

Note that the actual filter is vtkIntegrateFlowThroughSurface which
uses vtkSurfaceVectors to calculate vector . normal and then
vtkIntegrateAttributes to integrate it over a polygonal surface. If
you find a bug or inaccuracy that can be improved, please let us know.

void vtkIntegrateAttributes::IntegrateTriangle(vtkDataSet* input,

Actually, it may be leaking display properties. Try:

Delete(dp)

The best thing to do in scripts is to be consistent in whether you use
the simple or the servermanager to create objects. If you use the
simple module, make sure you call Delete(). If you are using
servermanager, you don't have to call Delete().

I think that this goes for the display properties. As soon as you call
Show() or GetDisplayProperties(), the simple module will create a
representation object and register it with what is called the proxy
manager. By the way, calling Initialize() on the view is a bad idea.
It doesn't do what you think it does. Do this:

for infile in glob.glob( os.path.join(path, '*.vtk') ):
     print "Input file: " + infile

     # read the vtk file
     reader = LegacyVTKReader(FileNames=infile)
     Show(reader)
     dp = GetDisplayProperties(reader)

     # Create LUT
     dp.LookupTable = MakeBlueToRedLT(0, 1)

     # Set array to color by the model
     dp.ColorAttributeType = 'POINT_DATA'
     dp.ColorArrayName = 'Model'
     servermanager.createModule("piecewise_functions", servermanager.rendering)

     # Setup opacity function
     opacity_func = servermanager.rendering.PiecewiseFunction()
     opacity_func.Points = [0, 0, 1, 0.5]
     dp.ScalarOpacityFunction = opacity_func
     dp.Representation = 'Volume'

     view0 = GetActiveView()
     view0.Background =[0.57,0.61,0.77]

     # Set the camera and view options, etc
     view0.OrientationAxesVisibility=1
     view0.CenterAxesVisibility=1
     view0.ViewSize=[632,632]
     view0.CameraPosition = [430,420,310]
     view0.CameraFocalPoint = [-135,-125,-20]
     view0.CameraViewUp = [-0.26,-0.29,0.92]

     # Render
     Render()

     # write out the png file
     new=infile.replace('.vtk','.png')  # use orig filename for png filename
     print "Output file: " + new
     WriteImage(new, view0)

     view0.Representations = []
     Delete(dp)
     Delete(reader)

Subject: [Paraview] compiling master from git, problem on debian machine
Message-ID: <alpine.DEB.2.00.1102111804170.3842@localhost>


  I've tried compiling the git source on a 32 and a 64 bit machine. Both 
run debian testing.

  I've tried with MPI2PY ON and OFF

  I'm using MPI YES, Python YES

  Both stop with the error (see attach)


  Any ideas?

All,

Users frequently want or call into question how surface facet areas are 
calculated.

For what it is worth, I have attached a closed-form (exact) calculation 
for bilinear 4-node quadrilateral facets in three-dimensions. The code 
'scrap' that implements this follows:
------------------------------------------------------------------
!!
!! Exact middle-surface area calculation: dA = (A,(P,Xi1 x P,Xi2))
!!
       Area = ZERO

It looks like you need to install the mpi headers for the version of mpi you
have installed on your machine.

Interesting. Unfortunately, I cannot reproduce this. Would you mind
helping me debug this? You'll need a debug build of ParaView built
from source however. I'd recommend building using the latest
git-master.

Thanks

Richard,

The problem is indeed due to  offscreen rendering. I've added a bug
(http://paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=11847). Until this is resolved,
the work-around would be to uncheck "Use offscreen rendering for
screenshots" in Edit | settings dialog (Render View page).

I have them. I regularly compile mpi programs on these machines, either my 
own or from third parties...

I have checked, this directory is given in CMAKE has the MPI INCLUDE dir

/usr/lib/openmpi/include

and ls'ing its contents...

2011.02.11 18:56:29
rreis at umdrum: ~/tmp/src/paraview/ParaView.build
5022.0 $ ls /usr/lib/openmpi/include
mpif-common.h  mpif-config.h  mpif.h  mpif-mpi-io.h  mpi.h  openmpi  vampirtrace

althougth from the log you see

/home/rreis/tmp/src/paraview/ParaView/VTK/Utilities/mrmpi/src/mapreduce.cpp:14:17: error: mpi.h: No such file or directory

so it's cmake or paraview that are looking for the files in the wrong 
place or the INCLUDE is not done properly.

shouldn't it try to compile it with mpicxx maybe? (I'm shooting in the 
dark, don't know if this particular part is being compiled with mpicxx 
or mpic++ or just c++ (which would lead you to g++ in my system)

thanks for the sugestion but that is not the problem...

I ended up writing a vtkpython script to convert line data from a GMT
format to a vtkPolyData structure.  Write out the vtp file and load
into Paraview.  Seems to work well.

Cheers,

Dan

I suggest replacing the Calculator and DescriptiveStatistics filters
with one python programmable filter (or python calculator if you are
using 3.10). That way the data type isn't changed and Fetch will do
what you expect it to - produce a standard vtkDataSet with 1
point/cell.

The python calculator expression to get an average x,y,and Z point location is:
hstack([
[global_mean(inputs[0].Points[:,0])],
[global_mean(inputs[0].Points[:,1])],
[global_mean(inputs[0].Points[:,2])]
])

If you then Fetch it's output and get the min (or equivalently max or
just deliver the whole thing and just look at any of the points) you
will get the average X Y and Z coordinates in a 3 component array
names Result.

Thanks Michael.
I guess you are right that extra time is due to overlapping the ghost
layers.

If you want more performance, you should use .pvti and .vti instead .pvtr
and .vtr to store rectilinear data.

My grid is not necessarily uniform even in one direction. If I remember
correctly, *.vti files are only for constant spacing, e.g. dx (or dy or dz)
in each direction which should not work in my case.

Thanks
M

If there are no suggestions in terms of Amazon machines, perhaps some info
somewhere regarding offscreen rendering for a headless paraview server? I
have searched through the mail archives to the best of my ability, and
followed the instructions on the server build wiki, and I am just not quite
able to get PV to build correctly. Sorry to keep pestering.

Hi Matthew,

The ParaView Users Guide has a section on setting up offscreen rendering
using OSMesa which you can read at:

Thank you, I have been using that section as a guideline for getting this
thing set up. Perhaps someone on the list has a recommendation for a known
version of mesa that works with PV 3.8/3.10?

Try MesaLib-7.6.1.tar.gz

Make sure you configure with --driver osmesa.  The result should be a
libOSMesa and libGLU, no libGL.  Paraview should link only with libOSMesa,
no to libGL.  When you're done build paraview, an ldd on the binary should
reveal no dependencies on libGL, only libOSMesa.

I've heard that the most recent Mesa versions work well but have not
tried them myself. I always fall back to 7.6.2 since I've gotten that
to work in several different places.

Also, when compiling set VTK_USE_X to OFF.  An ldd on your binary should
show no X11 library dependencies either.  When compiled without X, you dont
need to specify any --use-offscreen-rendering flag to pvserver.  It is
possible to compile with X and libGL and OSMesa, but it sounds like you are
trying to create a pure osmesa build?

Pat,
Alrighty, I will make sure to do that. I think the best option is to do a
pure osmesa build (it sounds like its simpler at the end of the day...) but
I am certainly up for recommendations otherwise. Thanks

Subject: new widget to spy on your vtk objects
To: vtkdev <vtk-developers at vtk.org>


Hello vtk and qt heads,

I've got a new widget to share with you.  Actually it's not new.  I wrote
the code several months ago when I was stuck in an airport.  I finally got
around to rebasing it and pushing to github.  I added a wiki page with
screenshots:

    http://vtk.org/Wiki/DebugLeaksView

Motivation: VTK_DEBUG_LEAKS is a great help, any developer worth his or her
salt has it enabled... (right?)  But it only reports leaky objects at
program shutdown.  I wanted to spy on my vtk objects at runtime.  So I
created this debug leaks widget.  Please see the wiki page for a
demonstration!

Pat

Can I still do volume rendering with osmesa, or is this a gpu thing?

Make sure you configure with --driver osmesa.  The result should be a libOSMesa and libGLU, no libGL.  Paraview should link only with libOSMesa, no to libGL.  When you're done build paraview, an ldd on the binary should reveal no dependencies on libGL, only libOSMesa.

Nathan,
Thanks for the reply. That cleared out most of the warnings. I am left with:

 WARNING: Target "vtkRendering" requests linking to directory
"/home/ubuntu/osmesa/lib".  Targets may link only to libraries.  CMake is

which seems kind of critical to me... I am sure i am missing something else,
but not sure what:

The OSMESA_LIBRARY should also point to libOSMesa.so

(btw you can also compile leaving OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY and OPENGL_glu_LIBRARY empty.  I found I needed to do this when compiling static to avoid link errors in, I think, the XDMF library).

Subject: [Paraview] Transparency based on scalar
Message-ID: <1013800181.83241.1297475285438.JavaMail.root@mail2.gatech.edu>

Hi,

I would like to set the transparency of something based on a scalar. For example, if I took a Slice of a dataset, I would like to make it transparent based on, say, density gradient such that zero-gradient is transparent and some value indicates opaque. 

I haven't seen any existing filters to indicate this is possible. Is there a filter that does it? Is it something that's even possible to do through, say, a programmable filter? 

We're just getting into scripting with Paraview and it takes us a long time to figure out how to even do simple things, so before I spin my wheels on this one, I'd like to get some expert opinions on if it's even feasible. 

Thanks,

Tim

Hi,

A couple of bugs turn up when building 3.8.1 using portland group 
compiler (see below) I attached a patch for each, hoping they can make 
it into the 3.10 release if they are not already there.

Subject: [Paraview] movie with paraview
Message-ID: <4D55BF72.6040709@matsceng.ohio-state.edu>

Hi,
I have a 3D structure that I visualize with paraview 3.8.1 on
Windows, and I was wondering if it were possible to
make a movie showing this 3D structure turning around its center.

Any help is warmly welcomed.

View -> Animation View

Select "Camera" and "Orbit" near the "+" button and click "+" button, there
you can select different parameters

Hit play button

That might be what you want.

What would work on linux? I tried the above
View -> Animation View
ok
but did not see "Camera" or "Orbit".

Select "Camera" and "Orbit" near the "+" button and click "+" button, 
there you can select different parameters

Subject: [Paraview] pvbatch and save data
Message-ID: <4D5663B5.8080904@yahoo.de>

Hi all,

I have written a python-script to interpolate data from one geometry to
another and save the result. Running it in serial works fine with pvbatch.
In parallel I have no working writer so far. I tried it with vtk, pvd
(mpi errors) and ensight (data written half, no blocks found). Is there
something special to be aware of for writing data in parallel? I use
3.8.1 stable paraview on Linuxx86_64.
Btw. is it still necessary to run mergeblock on multi-block datasets
before use resampleWIthDataset? Is there any way to either keep the
blocks or retrive them after interpolation? Thanks.

Regards Bastian

In Animation View near the + sign you can select "Camera" form the first
drop down menu and "Orbit" from the second drop down menu.

Yes, but depends on the volume-rendering algorithm. In general for
both structured and unstructured data, there are pure software
versions available.

I am guessing that this error is related to the error you mentioned below...

/home/ubuntu/ParaView-3.8.1/Utilities/Xdmf2/libsrc/utils/XdmfExodusReader.cxx:27:22:
error: exodusII.h: No such file or directory

I have no need for the exodusii reader, I didn't see anywhere that I could
disable it in cmake

If I understand your question, this is not directly supported.  Although in volume rendering you can set opacity based on the scalar value, in surface rendering you cannot.  There is an entry in ParaView UserVoice for this feature.  If you feel ParaView should support this feature, you should go to this UserVoice link and vote for it.

It may be possible to have a filter to create a field of colors with alpha value and then render dependent colors.  I know of no existing filters that already do that, though.

Subject: [Paraview] writing spheres, cones, etc.
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=RKbw2V_3F4iyOHMTL=rgTNRzzU5NbOdibPzU-@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
 I am new to using VTK and paraview, so excuse me if my question is too
obvious. I've been looking into several manuals and the online VTK wiki, but
couldn't find exactly what I was looking for.
 I want to visualize abstract shapes, mainly spheres and cones. After
looking into different formats, such as legacy VTK, and trying to create
these shapes from polygons, I am now using VTK from C++ to create the shapes
I want.  However my problem is now that I don't know how to store them
(except for taking a screenshot). Is there a writer I can use for that?
 Also: once I am satisfied with my visualization, I would like to be able to
export to povray. It would be very convenient to be turn my objects until I
have a good viewpoint and then export with camera and light sources
accordingly to pov format. Could somebody give a simple example how this is
possible?
Thanks a lot,
Benjamin.

 My template now looks like this and is based on examples in the wiki:

int main(int argc, char** argv[])
{
    std::vector<vtkSmartPointer<vtkPolyDataAlgorithm> >
geometricObjectSources;

geometricObjectSources.push_back(vtkSmartPointer<vtkSphereSource>::New());

geometricObjectSources.push_back(vtkSmartPointer<vtkCylinderSource>::New());

    std::vector<vtkSmartPointer<vtkRenderer> > renderers;
    std::vector<vtkSmartPointer<vtkPolyDataMapper> > mappers;
    std::vector<vtkSmartPointer<vtkActor> > actors;

    // Visualize
    vtkSmartPointer<vtkRenderer> renderer =
vtkSmartPointer<vtkRenderer>::New();
    vtkSmartPointer<vtkRenderWindow> renderWindow =
vtkSmartPointer<vtkRenderWindow>::New();
    renderWindow->AddRenderer(renderer);
    vtkSmartPointer<vtkRenderWindowInteractor> renderWindowInteractor =
vtkSmartPointer<vtkRenderWindowInteractor>::New();
    renderWindowInteractor->SetRenderWindow(renderWindow);

    // Create a source, renderer, mapper, and actor
    // for each object
    for(unsigned int i = 0; i < geometricObjectSources.size(); i++){
        geometricObjectSources[i]->Update();

        mappers.push_back(vtkSmartPointer<vtkPolyDataMapper>::New());

mappers[i]->SetInputConnection(geometricObjectSources[i]->GetOutputPort());


        actors.push_back(vtkSmartPointer<vtkActor>::New());
        actors[i]->SetMapper(mappers[i]);

        renderer->AddActor(actors[i]);
    }

  renderWindow->Render();
  renderWindowInteractor->Start();

  //// Here I want to write my objects into a file
  //// or: turn the object and then export to povray with camera according
to viewpoint

  return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}

 vtkPythonCore errors
Message-ID: <7F7CB2A87C76454FA8409EA326FC02971E42171C@exch-mbx1.ad.renci.org>

Hello,
I am building Paraview from git source on a Windows7 64bit OS with MSVC2010. I have enabled
PARAVIEW_ENABLE_PYTHON and VTKMY_WRAP_PYTHON in my CMake. I also built Python 2.7.1 64bit from source so that I have both python27.lib and python27_d.lib available. However the core python related projects are failed to build in both Debug and Release builds. Then the effects just trickled down like crazy. Below are 3 major errors in Debug build I feel might be the primary errors. And I do link python27_d.lib for all of them. Please see the attached CMakeLists.txt for more details.

Error      6              error LNK1104: cannot open file 'python27.lib'                C:\ParaViewGit\Utilities\VTKPythonWrapping\Executable\LINK               vtkPVPythonInterpretor

Would you please help me? Thanks a lot.

Hi,

Is there a reason you want to code up in C++?  You can create spheres and
cones (under the Source menu) in ParaView and set their parameters like
center, resolution, size, etc.  There are also other common geometries like
cylinders, boxes, etc.  You can save the results in a POV file by choosing
Export and choosing POV as the file type.  If you want to automate the
process you can record a python script as well which can be modified to
change the filter parameters and then run it with either pvpython or
pvbatch.

Hi,
 thanks Andy, for the information about python and povray. Pvpython and
pvbatch sound good. Maybe the matlab interface also provides what I need.
Indeed, I need to automate the process to read in text files with
coordinates and set then objects at these coordinates. I am now half-way
through parsing the text file and setting the objects in C++ and I don't
want to change again to a different language. Could somebody provide an
example of how to write a povray file with the current camera view in C++?
thanks,
Benjamin.

Hi Tim,
A workaround may be to create your own color map which includes alpha values. In Object Inspector, Display tab, Color panel, Edit Color Map... you can choose from a set of preset color maps, and Import your own. I have used Export on an existing one to save as xml, then edited or written new xml color map, and Imported that although I never played with alpha values.
I have noticed in the interactive Color Scale Editor GUI some color maps allow you to interactively set alpha while at other times they do not ! Perhaps something to do with the type of dataset? In which case you may be stuck? ie volumes allow alpha, surfaces don't? You might even try interactive editing first, by clicking in the color bar in the Color Scale Editor you can add new points, dragging those up or down changes opacity, as does manually entering a value in the Opacity box, but sometimes that is disabled. Someone out there must know the reasons behind this? but perhaps there are enough clues here for you to make something work for you.

I just managed to set up a keyboard callback with the render window that
calls the pov writer (tutorial
http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK/Tutorials/Callbacks). This sets everything,
including the right camera perspective.
I wonder why so few render programs (only povray?) accept more generic types
such as cones and spheres, etc. and why there are seem to be no programs
that read povray format and allow turning the camera.

Cool! Thanks Burlen. If I apply them can you give the release branch a try
to see if there are any other issues with that compiler tool chain?

Hi Xunlei,

What do you have the PYTHON_LIBRARY cmake option set to? If you set that
correctly then it should be able to link properly. For example this is what
it is set to on my machine.

C:/Support/Python27-x32/libs/python27.lib

Hi David,
I am out of luck.
Just did a fresh CMake configure with PARAVIEW_ENABLE_PYTHON on and the same PYTHON_LIBRARY value. The errors from MSVC2010. Any other suggestions?
Best,

Subject: [Paraview] moving cameras
Message-ID: <ABD1B5752A0D724F9E100C97EA9EB7E15CEEF9CF97@exvic-mbx04.nexus.csiro.au>

Hi,

I just downloaded 3.10.0-RC1 and it still has an annoying moving camera issue.

PROBLEM: I am unable to create independent moving cameras for each viewport of a scene

INSTRUCTIONS FOR REPLICATING THE PROBLEM:
1. Create a cone
2. Split the view so there are now two 3d viewports
3. In the animation view add a "Camera->Orbit"
4. Hit play, one of the viewports should rotate.
5. Select the other viewport and try to add a "Camera->Orbit". It will NOT let you do this.

SUGGESTED FIX:
1. Make the "add camera -> Orbit/Follow Path/Interpolate Camera Locations" operate on the CURRENTLY selected viewport.

MY CURRENT ANNOYING WORKAROUND:
- adding "camera -> Interpolate Camera Locations" immediately after each new viewport is created.

Do other people experience this bug?

Thanks,
Ray

What operating system is this? I just tried it on mac and I don't seem
to have any issue adding the second orbit for the second view
irrespective of whether I add the orbit immediately after creating the
view or and some other point in future. Is there something else I
should be doing to reproduce this issue?

You can apply the glyph filter. Or use the "Point Sprite" plugin to
show sprites at the point locations.

It's a bug alright. XML-plugins are being treated as second class
citizens by the plugin management code right now. Hopefully we can get
this fixed for 4.0.

I experience the behaviour in both windows xp 32 bit and windows 7 64 bit.

To be clear, lets say you make something like 2x2 viewports and then start adding cameras, you will only be able to add one.

Hi,
I just tried the steps to reproduce the bug: I got the same behaviour
as Raymond. My ParaView is 3.10.0-RC1 compiled from the git repo
eponymous tag.
OS is Linux Fedora13-x86_64

Subject: [Paraview] Show Widget in CompoundSourceProxy
Message-ID: <AANLkTik8HaGwVN5XCpTkuVB5FgWh-GdLhFBX8vyDM1Lv@mail.gmail.com>

Hello!

I am trying to write an xml definition for a CompoundSourceProxy in ParaView
3.8.1 that produces a plane that is used by a probe filter to
show the ParaView input (volume data in my case) on the plane. The position
and orientation of the plane should be controlled by a widget.

The problem:
I have been able to create a plane as a SourceProxy that is controlled by a
widget and I have been able to create a CompoundSourceProxy that shows the
volume data on a plane but the CompoundSourceProxy does not show the Widget
that is defined with the PropertyGroup hints in the SourceProxy plane. If I
create an instance of the plane without the CompoundSourceProxy then the
widget is displayed as it should. Does hint widget information disappear
when sources are used in a CompoundSourceProxy? How does one use widgets to
control properties in subproxies in a CompoundSourceProxy?

The xml definition I have written follows here (sorry about the length):
-----------------------
The structure of this file is like so:
ParaViewInput(Volume)-->Calculator--(source)-->Probe
Filter<--(input)--PlaneSource<--Widget

<ServerManagerConfiguration>
  <ProxyGroup name="sources">
   <!-- Plane Source -->
   <SourceProxy name="PlaneSourceWithWidget" class="vtkPlaneSource"
label="PlaneWithWidget">
      <Documentation
        long_help="Create a parallelogram given an origin and two points.
The resolution indicates the number of division along each axis of the
plane."
        short_help="Create a parallelogram from an origin and two points">
The Plane source can be used to add a polygonal parallelogram to the 3D
scene. Unlike the sphere, cone, and cylinder sources, the parallelogram is
exactly represented at the lowest resolution, but higher resolutions may be
desired if this plane is to be used as an input to a filter. The output of
the Plane source is polygonal data.

Christoffer,

You need to redefine the Hints for the "PropertyGroup" on the
CompoundSourceProxy  as well. Also the properties that the widget is
controlling, such as Point1WorldPosition, Point2WorldPosition,
Resolution must be exposed from the CompoundSourceProxy.

I was able to reproduce it. The problem was hiding itself when only 2
views were created. I've committed a fix to git-master. I'll try to
get it into 3.10. Thanks for reporting.

Subject: [Paraview] calling apply from inside a filter (reader)
Message-ID: <4D59505A.6040605@ec-nantes.fr>

Hello everybody,

I have a reader and I will like to update my data in real time, when I 
move a slider (like QSlider::setTracking(1) ).

If a use Auto Accept (in Settings) there is a small lag between the 
release of the slider and the update.

And also I don't what the auto accept for all the filters.

so how can I call the apply function from inside the filter?
any ideas??

Thanks

Actually, the error I saw was related to it trying to include a wrong renderwindow.h ..

However, your error is similar.  It looks like it's got the wrong directory for including exodus headers, since it includes

${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/Utilities/exodusii/include

when it should probably be

${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/VTK/Utilities/exodusii/include

if it's building inside Paraview.  I'm not knowledgeable enough to say what the true answer is, since I think it's not always built inside paraview.

The shorter answer may be just to disable XDMF_BUILD_UTILS in your CMake config.

I am guessing that this error is related to the error you mentioned below...

/home/ubuntu/ParaView-3.8.1/Utilities/Xdmf2/libsrc/utils/XdmfExodusReader.cxx:27:22: error: exodusII.h: No such file or directory

I have no need for the exodusii reader, I didn't see anywhere that I could disable it in cmake

The OSMESA_LIBRARY should also point to libOSMesa.so

(btw you can also compile leaving OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY and OPENGL_glu_LIBRARY empty.  I found I needed to do this when compiling static to avoid link errors in, I think, the XDMF library).

Nathan,
Thanks for the reply. That cleared out most of the warnings. I am left with:

 WARNING: Target "vtkRendering" requests linking to directory "/home/ubuntu/osmesa/lib".  Targets may link only to libraries.  CMake is dropping the item.

which seems kind of critical to me... I am sure i am missing something else, but not sure what:

Message-ID: <7F7CB2A87C76454FA8409EA326FC02971E421E85@exch-mbx1.ad.renci.org>

Hi All,
I am trying to run paraview.exe after built it (Debug version) on a Windows7 64bit + MSVC2010 machine. However the application failed to run the following call stack:

       vtksys.dll!vtksys::SystemTools::FileExists(const char * filename=0xcccccccccccccccc)  Line 928 + 0xd bytes  C++
>      vtksys.dll!vtksys::SystemTools::FileExists(const char * filename=0xcccccccccccccccc, bool isFile=true)  Line 950 + 0xa bytes C++
      vtkPVServerManager.dll!vtkSMPluginManager::LoadPluginConfigurationXML(const char * filename=0xcccccccccccccccc)  Line 97 + 0x10 bytes     C++
      pqCore.dll!pqApplicationCore::loadDistributedPlugins(const char * filename=0x0000000000000000)  Line 726 + 0x5d bytes     C++

The related lines of code might be:

pqApplicationCore.cxx:line 725

  vtkSMApplication::GetApplication()->GetPluginManager()->LoadPluginConfigurationXML(
    config_file.toStdString().c_str());
}

Where config_file is "C:/ParaViewGit/bin/Debug/../.plugins". Such file is attached. After the process runs into vtkSMPluginManager

void vtkSMPluginManager::LoadPluginConfigurationXML(const char* filename)
{
  bool debug_plugin = vtksys::SystemTools::GetEnv("PV_PLUGIN_DEBUG") != NULL;
  vtkPVPluginLoaderDebugMacro("Loading plugin configuration xml: " << filename);
  if (!vtksys::SystemTools::FileExists(filename, true))
    {

Where filename becomes "0xcccccccccccccccc <Bad Ptr>". Any idea? Thanks a lot.

Best,
x

Are you sure there isn't some dll conflict issue? Do you have other
installations of ParaView?

Hi Utkarsh,
This is the only copy of ParaView I am building from git source. I have no ther VTK installation.
BTW, do you see many issues with MSVC2010? I am frustrated with ParaView building process and not sure whether it is compiler/IDE related. Thanks a lot.

Best,
x

Honestly, I am not the best guy to comment about windows, I use linux
for most of my development. Dave, any insights?

What is the value of config_file variable in pqApplicationCore.cxx:725?

We do test nightly with VS10 and one of our developers actively uses it as
well so it "should" work. Have you tried running paraview with -dr command?
In the mean time I will try and run the vs10 build on the dashboard machine.

Hi Utkarsh and Dave,
It is
"C:/ParaViewGit/bin/Debug/../.plugins"
It looks all valid. However, even extracting the QString content before calling LoadPluginConfigurationXML(), say
	const char* fn_c_str = config_file.toStdString().c_str();
	std::string fn_std_str = config_file.toStdString();
gives me corrupted content.
Best,
x

Honestly, I am not the best guy to comment about windows, I use linux for most of my development. Dave, any insights?

What is the value of config_file variable in pqApplicationCore.cxx:725?

Thanks, David. Please give me a day or two. I just flooded the VS10 build directory with my previous successful VS08 build in order to get some work done. I will build through VS10 tomorrow night.

We do test nightly with VS10 and one of our developers actively uses it as well so it "should" work. Have you tried running paraview with -dr command? In the mean time I will try and run the vs10 build on the dashboard machine.

The only way is to write a custom panel for your filter that calls
apply() on the panel and requests a render everytime the slider moves.

Python and MPI but not MySQL. If you don't mind, can you send us your
CMakeCache.txt from the root of your build tree? I am curious if I can glean
anything from that. (feel free to send it off list).

Subject: [Paraview] coprocessing update
Message-ID: <AANLkTimK89gWue2hcOazOOivGgd_2r3G8Ssri+USqey0@mail.gmail.com>

I just wanted to give an update on some small changes for the coprocessing
library that will be in ParaView 3.10.  It is aimed more at the users who
aren't interested in using the coprocessing python script generator and
would rather use C++ to drive their coprocessing pipelines.  The changes
are:

1) The coprocessing library does not depend on python anymore.  This
simplifies the build process for those not interested in using python
pipeline scripts for coprocessing (thanks to Nathan Fabian for the change).

2) Coprocessing pipelines can now be added and removed during the simulation
run.  This should give users finer grained control over which pipelines are
to be used.  My thinking for this change was that the developer could add a
library of coprocessing pipelines and the user could then control which ones
are actually used during a specific simulation run.

Subject: [Paraview] Polyvertex Topology
Message-ID: <loom.20110215T045436-908@post.gmane.org>

I'm trying to visualize some particles in a fluid flow using xdmf (loading an
HDF5 file). From the info in the mail archives I tried to generate a simple
example using Polyvertexes. However, this simple example file causes ParaView to
crash.

I guess, I haven't fully understood the use of the Polyvertex topology. Thanks
for any advice,

Matthias

Utkarsh,

Thank you for your response it has helped me make the xml file shorter since
I don't need to copy the PlaneSource to add a widget to it. Exposing the
needed properties in the CompoundSourceProxy worked well but I cannot get
the widget hints to work, whenever I add the hints section to
the CompoundSourceProxy ParaView crashes when applying the filter to a
volume. Do you know if I am doing things correctly?

I am using 32bit ParaView (3.8.1 and 3.10 rc1) on Windows 7

Here is the xml again (somewhat shorter this time):

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview lighting Vs Command line
Message-ID: <5328.9228.qm@web30403.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hi All,

I am using Paraview 3.10.0 64-bit. When I save the animation to png and do a 
trace to python code, the lighting effect from the outcome of Paraview differs 
from the output of the Command-line.
Any idea?

You can check the difference through those 2 links:

Hi,

I am not able to help and it might be off-topic (it is just related to 
python tracing), but would like to add, that the camera position is not 
correctly tracked when using the tracing option...

Regards!
Fabian

Can both of you file these as bugs on paraview.org/Bug when you can. Thank
you very much for pointing these out.

The "name" in the hints section should match the "exposed_name" for
the exposed properties.

Subject: [Paraview] unstructured grid, programmable filters: extract,
	process array data
Message-ID: <AANLkTikeh-jXXn4Jj4rwpmpDrSAuvmx4qFUA_BhySn+G@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I've been looking at
<http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Python_Programmable_Filter> to create a
programmable filter, but I'm a bit lost as to whether or not I need
GetPolyData, CopyAttributes,...

Essentially, I have an unstructured grid in an ExodusII file (like the
attached file actually) with point data "psi" in it that has two
components (X,Y). I can plot psi:X, psi:Y, and psi:magnitude alright
with the default GUI options, but what I would really like to have
plotted is X^2+Y^2 (no sqrt()) and something along the lines of
arctan(Y/X).

Is there simple code somewhere some that takes array data off of an
unstructured grid, does something with it and returns the extra array
from the filter?

Cheers,
Nico

This sounds like a job for the calculator filter.  "coordsX^2+coordsY^2" for
your first example (or "psi__X^2+psi__Y^2" for the psi variables) and
"atan(coordsX/coordsY)" for the second example.

It can operate on point or cell data (set in the Attribute Model drop-down
menu), replace invalid numbers with a specified value, and you can name the
resulting array as well.

Subject: [Paraview] Polyvertex Topology
In-Reply-To: <loom.20110215T045436-908@post.gmane.org>

Hi Matthias,

Try changing your Topology tag to:

<Topology TopologyType="Polyvertex" NumberOfElements="2">

The NumberOfElements property corresponds to the number of points or  
particles you have in your system for a Polyvertex type file.

This shouldn't be (but seems to often be) confused with the Dimension  
property of the DataItem for the Geometry.

The best way to think about it from my experience is that the  
NumberOfElements is a grid topology specific item, so it should be  
related to the grid itself (i.e. you're grid is just 2 particle).   
This is in contrast to the Dimensions property of the Geometry, which  
is related to the underlying data (which in this case is Dimensions="2  
3" because you are using <Geometry Type="XYZ>).  Dimension  is a  
general property of any underlying data (i.e. Geomety or any scalar/ 
vector/tensor, etc.) and is uniquely determined by the nature of the  
underlying data rather than the way you intend on representing it on  
the grid.

Also, when you get a crash - it can be handy to check the log files to  
see what went wrong.  On OS X (sorry I don't know about other systems)  
you can access all the logs (Paraview logs, as well as the overall  
system logs) in the Console.  I've found this useful when I cause PV  
to crash with a bad XDMF file as otherwise you don't get much  
information because the application crashes so fast it is impossible  
to read the error message that pops up.

Fabian,

I guess you use parallel projection? I have seen quite some bugs in
combination with views and parallel projection. Would be nice to get
them fixed.

Subject: [Paraview] Mesa-7.8.2 incompatible?
Message-ID: <C9804059.10EA9%ndfabia@sandia.gov>

Hi,

I've built a recent pull of the master branch against Mesa-7.8.2. I'm
building pure Offscreen with no X or GL.  When I try to render I get the
following fatal error:

main/renderbuffer.c:1924: _mesa_add_renderbuffer: Assertion `bufferName ==
BUFFER_DEPTH || bufferName == BUFFER_STENCIL ||
fb->Attachment[bufferName].Renderbuffer == ((void *)0)' failed.

I get this in my own coprocessing app, but I also tested pvserver connected
via client elsewhere and got the same error when the render started.  When I
build with GL both apps work fine.

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Nathan.

Use an older (7.6?) or newer mesa (7.9).

Yep.  7.9 works great.  I've used 7.8.2 with 3.8.x.  Is Mesa something people should expect to upgrade going to paraview 3.10?

Hi,

I've built a recent pull of the master branch against Mesa-7.8.2. I'm
building pure Offscreen with no X or GL.  When I try to render I get the
following fatal error:

main/renderbuffer.c:1924: _mesa_add_renderbuffer: Assertion `bufferName ==
BUFFER_DEPTH || bufferName == BUFFER_STENCIL ||
fb->Attachment[bufferName].Renderbuffer == ((void *)0)' failed.

I get this in my own coprocessing app, but I also tested pvserver connected
via client elsewhere and got the same error when the render started.  When I
build with GL both apps work fine.

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Nathan.

Hi Dave and All,
I got some progress in terms of building vtkPythonCore. I had Enthought's Python distribution ver 7.0.1 !!!64bit!!! initially. I have verified it is indeed a 64bit Python executable. The package comes with python27.lib and CMake did not blink and automatically set PYTHON_LIBRARY to that lib. However, during building, MSVC2010 kept reporting "python27.lib" cannot be found.
Now, the fun part, I uninstalled Enthought distribution and tried "Python 2.7.1 Windows X86-64 Installer" from
http://www.python.org/getit/
This time, MSVC2010 no longer complained about missing "python27.lib". I am left with errors like

Error    1          error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol __imp__invalid_parameter_noinfo_noreturn            C:\ParaViewGit_VS2010\VTK\Wrapping\Python\vtkPythonUtil.obj           vtkPythonCore

After a bit digging, the error has something to do std::vector. Here are the beginning lines of vtkPythonUtil.cxx

#include "vtkPythonUtil.h"
#include "vtkPythonOverload.h"

#include "vtkSystemIncludes.h"

#include "vtkObject.h"
#include "vtkSmartPointerBase.h"
#include "vtkWeakPointerBase.h"
#include "vtkVariant.h"
#include "vtkStdString.h"
#include "vtkUnicodeString.h"
#include "vtkWindows.h"
#include "vtkToolkits.h"

#include <vtksys/ios/sstream>
#include <vtkstd/map>
#include <vtkstd/vector>
#include <vtkstd/string>
#include <vtkstd/utility>
       ...

After I move "#include <vtkstd/vector>" to the top of the file, POW! vtkPythonCore is successfully built. So I guess #include <vector> in vtkstd/vector.h gets undefined somewhere by those headers listed before it. Not sure whether it is a bug for other people.

I am out of luck.
Just did a fresh CMake configure with PARAVIEW_ENABLE_PYTHON on and the same PYTHON_LIBRARY value. The errors from MSVC2010. Any other suggestions?

Hi Xunlei,

What do you have the PYTHON_LIBRARY cmake option set to? If you set that correctly then it should be able to link properly. For example this is what it is set to on my machine.

C:/Support/Python27-x32/libs/python27.lib

My Experience with Mesa 7.7(?) and 7.8 was that there was some major bug
where you could only set the MakeCurrent on the gl context more than once.

Hi Ricardo, Your errors are pretty strange. What debian are you using? Is
your MPI from the package manager?

VTK. Now I am in trouble with parallel rendering in vtk. I hope you can do
me a favor. I want to know which class do I need to parallel volume render
in VTK. I used vtkIceTRenderManager to render,but I can not get the result.
Could you tell how to use the class vtkIceTRenderManager? Colud you give me
a sample example?

  Just to add the problema was "solved".

  I've rerun ccmake and replaced the default value of the variable

  CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/usr/bin/c++

  by

  CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/usr/bin/mpic++

  and it compile without any problem.

Hi David and Rob,
Just want to add another data point.
I have rebuild ParaView from git source with MSVC2008 instead. Everything else is the same with what I was reporting before. Enthought Python 7.0.1 64bit is used. All the python flags in Cmake are turned on. PYTHON_DEBUG_LIBRARY is left empty accompanied with modified C:/Python27/include/pyconfig.h as following, i.e. assigning python27.lib as the debug library instead of default python27_d.lib.

                /* For an MSVC DLL, we can nominate the .lib files used by extensions */
#ifdef MS_COREDLL
#             ifndef Py_BUILD_CORE /* not building the core - must be an ext */
#                             if defined(_MSC_VER)
                                                /* So MSVC users need not specify the .lib file in
                                                their Makefile (other compilers are generally

The entire build went smoothly. And now I have a running (Debug) paraview package! Another interesting thing to be noted is with "VTK_WRAP_PYTHON_SIP". When it is enabled, CMake looks for sip installation in the system. However, current SIP source distribution for windows
http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/sip/download
does not have 64bit windows specs. There is only win32-msvc2008 variation as the closest match. That creates a 32bit installation instead. And vtkCommonPythonSIP(D) projects cannot be built due to incompatible libraries...

Hi Dave and All,
I got some progress in terms of building vtkPythonCore. I had Enthought's Python distribution ver 7.0.1 !!!64bit!!! initially. I have verified it is indeed a 64bit Python executable. The package comes with python27.lib and CMake did not blink and automatically set PYTHON_LIBRARY to that lib. However, during building, MSVC2010 kept reporting "python27.lib" cannot be found.
Now, the fun part, I uninstalled Enthought distribution and tried "Python 2.7.1 Windows X86-64 Installer" from
http://www.python.org/getit/
This time, MSVC2010 no longer complained about missing "python27.lib". I am left with errors like

Error    1          error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol __imp__invalid_parameter_noinfo_noreturn            C:\ParaViewGit_VS2010\VTK\Wrapping\Python\vtkPythonUtil.obj           vtkPythonCore

After a bit digging, the error has something to do std::vector. Here are the beginning lines of vtkPythonUtil.cxx

#include "vtkPythonUtil.h"
#include "vtkPythonOverload.h"

#include "vtkSystemIncludes.h"

#include "vtkObject.h"
#include "vtkSmartPointerBase.h"
#include "vtkWeakPointerBase.h"
#include "vtkVariant.h"
#include "vtkStdString.h"
#include "vtkUnicodeString.h"
#include "vtkWindows.h"
#include "vtkToolkits.h"

#include <vtksys/ios/sstream>
#include <vtkstd/map>
#include <vtkstd/vector>
#include <vtkstd/string>
#include <vtkstd/utility>
       ...

After I move "#include <vtkstd/vector>" to the top of the file, POW! vtkPythonCore is successfully built. So I guess #include <vector> in vtkstd/vector.h gets undefined somewhere by those headers listed before it. Not sure whether it is a bug for other people.

Just did a fresh CMake configure with PARAVIEW_ENABLE_PYTHON on and the same PYTHON_LIBRARY value. The errors from MSVC2010. Any other suggestions?

Hi Xunlei,

What do you have the PYTHON_LIBRARY cmake option set to? If you set that correctly then it should be able to link properly. For example this is what it is set to on my machine.

C:/Support/Python27-x32/libs/python27.lib

You can use the Python Calculator, which will let you use any valid Python expression -- such as math.atan2().

Message-ID: <AANLkTinEZXB8DOMtjkfZBrTAgyixJipzY3GXwLtHcrbP@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I have a data file with many time steps and I'd like to quickly browse
through it. Right now, the only thing I can do is click "play" and see
ParaView loop through each and every time step. This can take a long
time, particularly for complex data were rendering a frame takes a
long time.
I thought that a setting such as "show every n-th time step" exists,
but I wasn't able to fine something like that.

Are there other options?

Good idea. We don't have exactly that feature yet, so please submit a
request on user-voice for it.

In the meantime, open the Animation View and change the Mode from
"Snap To TimeSteps" to "Sequence". You can get nearly the same effect
with that.

Hi all

I would like to write a filter where i can select 2 arrays of the input 
polydata in the gui (for advanced filtering options, simply aplying the 
filter twice wouldn't help)

I did get the filter running with one selection ability like this:

vtkTrackFilter.cxx
----------
...
vtkTrackFilter2::vtkTrackFilter2()
{
	this->SetInputArrayToProcess(
		0,
		0,
		0,
		vtkDataObject::FIELD_ASSOCIATION_POINTS_THEN_CELLS,
		vtkDataSetAttributes::SCALARS);
}

...

int vtkTrackFilter2::RequestData(vtkInformation*,vtkInformationVector** 
inputVector,vtkInformationVector* outputVector)
{
	vtkInformation* outInfo = outputVector->GetInformationObject(0);
	vtkPolyData* output = vtkPolyData::GetData(outputVector);
	vtkPolyData* input = vtkPolyData::GetData(inputVector[0]);

	vtkSmartPointer<vtkCellArray> tracks = input->GetLines();
	vtkDataArray* filterArray = this->GetInputArrayToProcess(0, inputVector);

...
}
----------
and in the xml file: trackFilter.xml
----------
<ServerManagerConfiguration>
	<ProxyGroup name="filters">
		<SourceProxy name="TrackFilter" class="vtkTrackFilter"

Any hint how to ajust my code so i get this? Sorry, it's quite hard for 
me to understand the input ports, connection, idx stuff.. i suppose 
something like this would be the solution? can anyone point me to an

That sounds *exactly* like what I need. Great!
I'm having problems selecting the data sets though: Where
"atan(psi__Y/psi__X)" works with the calculator filter, "math.atan2(
psi__Y, psi__X)" fails in the PythonCalculator with

============== *snip* ==============
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 19, in <module>
  File "<string>", line 27, in RequestData
NameError: name 'psi__Y' is not defined
============== *snap* ==============

I looked at http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Python_Calculator but
couldn't figure out what's wrong.

Greg,

I was able to reproduce the slight zooming effect as the resolution
changes. I don't understand the camera transformation code employed
that well, so it will need some tracking down. However the animation
resolution issue definitely sounds like an easy fix. I'll take a look.

Hi Xunlei, we just checked in a change into paraview/vtk that should fix
this. As you noticed python forces a header link to python27_d.lib when
building debug. To get around this (because most python packages for windows
don't come with debug python libraries), we undefine _DEBUG, include
python.h and then restore _DEBUG.

The problem with this is that any system level headers included from
python.h were also effectively included in 'release' mode when we undefined
_DEBUG. To work around this we determined the set of headers that python
includes and include them before undefining _DEBUG. This seems to address
the linking issues. Please give it a try and let us know if you experience
any other issues.

Thanks!

Utkarsh,

I'm guessing that this is more problems with the padding that is added
when saving animations.  I'm guessing that the padding is added because
graphics cards sometimes do weird things to polygons that cross the
viewport, and this causes noticeable artifacts when tiling images.

I recently had to modify the behavior of the padding a bit to get around a
similar problem when views with large aspect ratios noticeably changed
zoom when the padding was added
(http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=9147).  I fixed it by making the
padding proportional to the image dimensions
(http://paraview.org/gitweb?p=ParaView.git;a=commit;h=f87c66d4b4322743db187
cf3a0efeed3ffaa3e52).

I suspect that there is a similar problem here.  When you double the
dimensions of the image, the padding stays the same.  Because the geometry
projection is based on the whole rendered window, including padding, and
because the padding does not proportionally change with the image
dimensions, the zoom of the clipped saved region is different.

Hmm, I tried extracting out the components using the Calculator filter and
then using the PythonCalculator filter to do that math.atan2 function.
Underneath the covers I believe there is a conversion from a vtkDataArray to
a numpy array and then back again.  I don't think this is getting done for
the math.atan2 function (it's not listed in the web page of python
calculator functions) so you may be stuck here unless someone else has an
idea.

So the Python Calculator only allows for the functions listed on the
webpage? That'd be quite limiting, really.

The expression

   dot( psi_, psi_ )

works, for example (and 'dot' is listed, too).
Well well. What would be needed then is access to the individual
components of each of the 2-component vectors in psi_, as well as
access to a wider range of Python functions.

To access the components of the vector, you have to first pass it through a regular Calculator filter where the result is just the component you want. So you would need to go through two regular Calculator filters, one to extract each component.

As for accessing more functions, I guess you're out of luck on that (for now). Back to the programmable filter I suppose. 

There is a function, I can't remember the name, to convert a vtkDataArray into a numpy array -- that's what you will want to use inside your prog. filter. You can then do any python thing on it and then convert it back into a data array. I can't remember the name of it though, perhaps somebody else can help you there if you can't find it online.

Subject: [Paraview] set input  in TemporalStatistic
Message-ID: <BLU0-SMTP2100895724FC2CA619754CEA6D50@phx.gbl>

Dear all,

I'm would like to use the TemporalStatistic filter to compute the mean of a specific quantity that I have computed using another filter.
The problem is that I don't understand if it is possible to set the input data in the TemporalStatistics filter
and how to do it. 
Does anyone now how to do this?

Thank you very much,

best regards

Claudia

Hi Nicolas, what CMake version are you using out of curiosity? In 3.10 I
switched to using FixUpBundle for dependency resolution which is where these
new messages are coming from.

It's cmake 2.8.2 (rpm from fedora 14: 2.8.2-3).

Do i need to upgrade to cmake 2.8.4 ?

Um, the same way as any other filter.  Select the input you want to feed
to the temporal statistics filter in the pipeline.  Then create the
temporal statistics filter (Filters -> Temporal -> Temporal Statistics)
and apply.

If the input supports time (i.e. it changes when you hit the play button),
the temporal statistics will automatically pick that up and iterate over
all the time steps.

Hi Nicolas,

It looks like Mesa is what is causing the issue. If you append /opt/mesa/lib
to PARAVIEW_FIXUP_BUNDLE_SEARCH_PATHS in cmake-gui/ccmake. That should get
it working. If you don't want to install any third party libs into paraview
you could alternatively set PARAVIEW_INSTALL_THIRD_PARTY_LIBRARIES to OFF.

It seems that in the SuperBuild directory the contents of the External_HDF5.cmake seem to have the contents of External_PNG.cmake instead. Just FYI if it matters.

Subject: [Paraview] Custom Plugins as Git Submodules

With the move to git I got to thinking that another, possibly more straight forward, way to build extra plugins would be to simply check them out as git submodules into my ParaView source tree. The issue would be I would have to add code into the ParaView/Plugins/CMakeLists.txt file to pick mine plugins up and build them. 

 I know there is the PARAVIEW_EXTRA_EXTERNAL_MODULES but maybe there could be a variation on that where the entire Plugins/ directory is scanned for plugins? I think Boost-CMake something like this. I know there are probably some show stopper draw backs to something along these lines that I am not thinking of but I just thought I would throw it out there for comments.

Subject: [Paraview] Bundled Version of HDF5 with ParaView
Message-ID: <1251623A-8CE6-4AAA-80DE-51D5AE3B1DBF@bluequartz.net>

Is there a way to tell the HDF5 bundled with ParaView to build using the HDF5 1.6 API instead of the 1.8 API? My code depends on the 1.6 API and using my own built HDF5 doesn't seem to be supported anymore.

Thanks

For VRML it looks like our ancient reader does not support aliasing.
If you can configure the code that created vmd1.wrl to inline the
VMDCyl and VMDMat, I suspect that ParaView will read it.

For our equally ancient OBJ it does appear that we do not support mtl
files. The vtkOBJReader.cxx has a comment (following) that describes
the small subset of OBJ that it will read. I was able to read the file
with 3.10 with a debug build, but not a release build, which indicates
an uninitialized variable in the reader, which I should be able fix
for 3.10 final.

Please suggest modernizing these readers on user voice and if enough
people chime in we'll get it into 3.10.1 or 4.10.


/*---------------------------------------------------------------------------*\

This is only partial support for the OBJ format, which is quite complicated.
To find a full specification, search the net for "OBJ format", eg.:

    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obj
    http://netghost.narod.ru/gff/graphics/summary/waveobj.htm

We support the following types:

v <x> <y> <z>

    vertex

vn <x> <y> <z>

    vertex normal

vt <x> <y>

    texture coordinate

f <v_a> <v_b> <v_c> ...

    polygonal face linking vertices v_a, v_b, v_c, etc. which
    are 1-based indices into the vertex list

f <v_a>/<t_a> <v_b>/<t_b> ...

    polygonal face as above, but with texture coordinates for
    each vertex. t_a etc. are 1-based indices into the texture
    coordinates list (from the vt lines)

f <v_a>/<t_a>/<n_a> <v_b>/<t_b>/<n_b> ...

    polygonal face as above, with a normal at each vertex, as a
    1-based index into the normals list (from the vn lines)

f <v_a>//<n_a> <v_b>//<n_b> ...

    polygonal face as above but without texture coordinates.

    Per-face tcoords and normals are supported by duplicating
    the vertices on each face as necessary.

l <v_a> <v_b> ...

    lines linking vertices v_a, v_b, etc. which are 1-based
    indices into the vertex list

p <v_a> <v_b> ...

    points located at the vertices v_a, v_b, etc. which are 1-based
    indices into the vertex list

Thanks for the reply. Any conversion alternatives? Like converting from
POVRay? 

Let me look into inlineing the VRML mats. I will probably panic more
about this in a month when stuff needs to work, but thanks for expressing
and interest.

Hmmm, I'd love to see the patch for this (I tend to build it from source
to begin with).

Also, if it reads texture coordinates, doesn't mtl make up part of the texture
definition? (and mtl is basically just a list of RGB triplets for
ambient, diffuse, and specular colors, and a single scalar each for alpha chan, 
phong, and illumination model, with an option for including a texture map);
I wonder if it's just a stub function we can replace (since the renderer
has to apply the default white texture somehow anyway...).

Hi Xunlei, we just checked in a change into paraview/vtk that should fix this. As you noticed python forces a header link to python27_d.lib when building debug. To get around this (because most python packages for windows don't come with debug python libraries), we undefine _DEBUG, include python.h and then restore _DEBUG.

The problem with this is that any system level headers included from python.h were also effectively included in 'release' mode when we undefined _DEBUG. To work around this we determined the set of headers that python includes and include them before undefining _DEBUG. This seems to address the linking issues. Please give it a try and let us know if you experience any other issues.

Hi David and Rob,
Just want to add another data point.
I have rebuild ParaView from git source with MSVC2008 instead. Everything else is the same with what I was reporting before. Enthought Python 7.0.1 64bit is used. All the python flags in Cmake are turned on. PYTHON_DEBUG_LIBRARY is left empty accompanied with modified C:/Python27/include/pyconfig.h as following, i.e. assigning python27.lib as the debug library instead of default python27_d.lib.

                /* For an MSVC DLL, we can nominate the .lib files used by extensions */
#ifdef MS_COREDLL

#                             if defined(_MSC_VER)

                                                taken care of by distutils.) */

#                                                             pragma comment(lib,"python27.lib")//"python27_d.lib")
#                                             else
#                                                             pragma comment(lib,"python27.lib")
#                                             endif /* _DEBUG */

#             endif /* Py_BUILD_CORE */
#endif /* MS_COREDLL */

The entire build went smoothly. And now I have a running (Debug) paraview package! Another interesting thing to be noted is with "VTK_WRAP_PYTHON_SIP". When it is enabled, CMake looks for sip installation in the system. However, current SIP source distribution for windows
http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/sip/download
does not have 64bit windows specs. There is only win32-msvc2008 variation as the closest match. That creates a 32bit installation instead. And vtkCommonPythonSIP(D) projects cannot be built due to incompatible libraries...

Subject: Re: [Paraview] build ParaView git on Windows7 64bit + MSVC2010 with vtkPythonCore errors

Hi Dave and All,
I got some progress in terms of building vtkPythonCore. I had Enthought's Python distribution ver 7.0.1 !!!64bit!!! initially. I have verified it is indeed a 64bit Python executable. The package comes with python27.lib and CMake did not blink and automatically set PYTHON_LIBRARY to that lib. However, during building, MSVC2010 kept reporting "python27.lib" cannot be found.
Now, the fun part, I uninstalled Enthought distribution and tried "Python 2.7.1 Windows X86-64 Installer" from
http://www.python.org/getit/
This time, MSVC2010 no longer complained about missing "python27.lib". I am left with errors like

Error    1          error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol __imp__invalid_parameter_noinfo_noreturn            C:\ParaViewGit_VS2010\VTK\Wrapping\Python\vtkPythonUtil.obj           vtkPythonCore

After a bit digging, the error has something to do std::vector. Here are the beginning lines of vtkPythonUtil.cxx

#include "vtkPythonUtil.h"
#include "vtkPythonOverload.h"

#include "vtkSystemIncludes.h"

#include "vtkObject.h"
#include "vtkSmartPointerBase.h"
#include "vtkWeakPointerBase.h"
#include "vtkVariant.h"
#include "vtkStdString.h"
#include "vtkUnicodeString.h"
#include "vtkWindows.h"
#include "vtkToolkits.h"

#include <vtksys/ios/sstream>
#include <vtkstd/map>
#include <vtkstd/vector>
#include <vtkstd/string>
#include <vtkstd/utility>
       ...

After I move "#include <vtkstd/vector>" to the top of the file, POW! vtkPythonCore is successfully built. So I guess #include <vector> in vtkstd/vector.h gets undefined somewhere by those headers listed before it. Not sure whether it is a bug for other people.

Hi Xunlei,

What do you have the PYTHON_LIBRARY cmake option set to? If you set that correctly then it should be able to link properly. For example this is what it is set to on my machine.

C:/Support/Python27-x32/libs/python27.lib

The problem is I am using VMD to render surfaces, ribbons, etc. which the 
PDB reader isn't going to do for me.

Subject: [Paraview] Adding 2-d text labels in 3-d space...
Message-ID: <AANLkTimWCaTq+Q4kakbP3MJDazFatTm=_NywF_hHV5EY@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm batch processing vtk files containing a model of ours, adding
sources/objects based on x,y,z coords, and then rendering/saving the field
of view (fov) as pngs. I want some 2-d text labels (i.e. sm.sources.text() )
to "follow" the added objects as they move through my fov. (A good analogy
would be labeling planets in a solar system simulation as they orbit the
sun.) I was hoping to avoid having to do the whole set of geometry
calculations to translate camera(x,y,z) and object(x,y,z) into an fov(x,y)
for text positioning. If I use 3D text then I can use the object(x,y,z) but
then I'll need to get the text orientation correct so that it's in the plane
of the fov again...

Is there an easier way to add labels like this? Am I overlooking something
obvious?

Many thanks!
Karl

OK, with PARAVIEW_INSTALL_THIRD_PARTY_LIBRARIES set to OFF, "make install"
works fine.

Subject: [Paraview] pvpython multiprocessing
Message-ID: <AANLkTin-s+KJmhc8HC-USy+TJVbE4koyRTgKzeRjtY2B@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I would like to use the multiprocessing module of pvpython (paraview 3.8.1
32 bits on windows -- binary release)
But trying to launch several multiprocessing.Process, nothing appen. A new
window with an interpreter is displayed.... but do nothing, even with the
simpliest task.
Is there some limitations about the use of multiprocessing with pvpython ?

Here is the code I use for testing, working well when running with python...
but does nothing with pvpython.

from multiprocessing import Process
import os
import time
def sleeper(name, seconds):
   print 'starting child process with id: ', os.getpid()
   print 'with arg ', name
   print 'sleeping for %s ' % seconds
   time.sleep(seconds)
   print "Done sleeping"

if __name__ == '__main__':
   p = Process(target=sleeper, args=('bob', 5))
   p.start()
   pp = Process(target=sleeper, args=('john', 5))
   pp.start()
   p.join()
   pp.join()


Thanks for help,

Aur?lien

Subject: [Paraview] SplineSource and python script
Message-ID: <AANLkTini8zZR2AT=yzdgiHr9p8=Aw33851s9ghiiJYuu@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I have some difficulties to have the SplineSource working properly
through a python script. First, I created a spline by hand and saved
the state as a python file. I simplified it in order to keep only the
SplineSource settings (file attached). When I execute this script
(ParaView-3.10-RC1), I get the following error :

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 6, in <module>
  File "/usr/local/lib/paraview-3.10/site-packages/paraview/servermanager.py",
line 207, in __setattr__
    "to add this attribute.")
AttributeError: Attribute Closed does not exist.  This class does not
allow addition of new attributes to avoid mistakes due to typos. Use
add_attribute() if you really want to add this attribute.

When I access the object through python shell, the "Closed" attribute
appears in a protected list (which seems to be the right case) :
>>>> FindSource("RCA").ParametricFunction.__dict__
{'SMProxy': (vtkSMProxy)0x48e25d0, '_Proxy__LastAttrName':
'NewPropertyIterator', '_Proxy__Properties': {'Points': <weakref at
0x4ce6ec0; dead>, 'Closed': <weakref at 0x4ce6158; dead>},
'ObserverTag': -1, 'Observed': None, 'Port': 0}

The same error occurs with the "Points" attribute, thus I cannot add
points by script : this is what I want to do.

Thanks !

Subject: [Paraview] misinterpreted VTK files in parallel pvserver
Message-ID: <4D5E753A.6040605@man.poznan.pl>

Hi,

I have problems with reading VTK files in parallel version of ParaView 
in client-server mode. I've made ParaView (3.8.1) to use OSMesa (7.5.2) 
for offscreen rendering. The VTK dataset is correctly interpreted and 
displayed in serial version of pvserver (also using offscreen rendering 
with OSMesa). However when I switch to parallel version of pvserver, the 
VTK data is misinterpreted. For example, the volume rendering is not 
correct, and the Counter filter gives quite different (and invalid) 
range value than the serial version does.

The VTK dataset is represented in serial XML file format, with data 
array written as base-64 binary encoded data. I guess the 'endian' issue 
is not the case when VTK files are XML-based.

The dataset is well distributed over nodes in parallel pvserver (checked 
with Process ID Scalars filter).


Does anyone have a clue what might be wrong then?


Regards,
  Michal

Message-ID: <1595833791.266272.1298037742299.JavaMail.root@mail2.gatech.edu>

Hi,

It's probably too late for the binaries already online, and there may be a good reason why it isn't done already, but would it be possible in the future to compile all the release builds with XDMF_WRAP_PYTHON enabled? 

Our lab needs to do some modification to our data files as we read them in order to keep the memory footprint reasonable -- we do it through a programmable source -- but that requires libvtkXdmfPython. If the release had it built in, we could just use that instead of having to compile from source on 30+ workstations.

Just a suggestion -- I'd be interested in hearing if it's a terrible/impossible idea.

Thanks,

Tim

Hi David and Utkarsh,
With your new patch on Python _DEBUG from git source, I was able to build on MSVC2010 without any PYTHON related hitches. I still have issues with VTK_WRAP_PYTHON_SIP as I reported earlier though.
When I launched the newly built paraview.exe I got the exact same error in pqApplicationCore.cxx, line 725:


  vtkSMApplication::GetApplication()->GetPluginManager()->LoadPluginConfigurationXML(
         config_file.toStdString().c_str());


QString config_file has value "C:/ParaViewGit_VS2010/bin/Debug/../.plugins". However, config_file.toStdString() has corrupted content.

BTW, shall I care about DirectX_LIBRARY? It appears ParaView's vtkRendering only uses DirectX9. Does including DirectX help ParaView performance on Windows machine?

Best,
x

We do test nightly with VS10 and one of our developers actively uses it as well so it "should" work. Have you tried running paraview with -dr command? In the mean time I will try and run the vs10 build on the dashboard machine.

We can probably do this for the final binaries. I was aware that this was off by default.

Hi, 

It's probably too late for the binaries already online, and there may be a good reason why it isn't done already, but would it be possible in the future to compile all the release builds with XDMF_WRAP_PYTHON enabled? 

Our lab needs to do some modification to our data files as we read them in order to keep the memory footprint reasonable -- we do it through a programmable source -- but that requires libvtkXdmfPython. If the release had it built in, we could just use that instead of having to compile from source on 30+ workstations. 

Just a suggestion -- I'd be interested in hearing if it's a terrible/impossible idea. 

Thanks, 

Tim

Xulei,

Just to be sure you are using Qt that was built with the same compilter right?

Hi Utkarsh,

It is the same setup with my MSVC2008 ParaView, where Qt is a prebuild release with MSVC2008 from
http://code.google.com/p/qt-msvc-installer/downloads/list
Very good catch!!! Does that mean I should either rebuild Qt with MSVC2010 or let ParaView build Qt along the way?

Best,
x

Subject: [Paraview] About integration upon a boundary
Message-ID: <AANLkTim42RSTt2R3ZSCiiABWy5OvrzMZAVesBM6YH2TU@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I am simulating a circular pipe flow, (a 2D axial symmetrical model),
and my current job is to estimate the mass flow rate and thermal
energy input at the inlet and the outlet. I am curious on using the
integration filter provided in ParaView. How do I apply an integration
upon a boundary?

Thanks a lot for your advices.

Best regards,

You should using matching compilers for both ParaView and Qt especially if
one is built debug and the other release. Unfortunately ParaView does not
build Qt for you.

Thanks a lot, David and Utkarsh. I was obnoxious about Qt aspect totally. By using this thread, can you comment on using DirectX with Paraview on Windows?

You should using matching compilers for both ParaView and Qt especially if one is built debug and the other release. Unfortunately ParaView does not build Qt for you.

Hi Utkarsh,

It is the same setup with my MSVC2008 ParaView, where Qt is a prebuild release with MSVC2008 from
http://code.google.com/p/qt-msvc-installer/downloads/list
Very good catch!!! Does that mean I should either rebuild Qt with MSVC2010 or let ParaView build Qt along the way?

Best,

Xulei,

Just to be sure you are using Qt that was built with the same compilter right?

No, I am able to include DirectX in the build. I am not sure whether it helps the rendering performance or potentially causing conflictions with OpenGL. So I guess there is no value in terms of performance gain and induces no conflictions with other settings, right?

It isn't required but is used to do some hardware support queries. Are you getting compile/configure errors complaining about not finding some part of DirectX?

You should using matching compilers for both ParaView and Qt especially if one is built debug and the other release. Unfortunately ParaView does not build Qt for you.

Hi Utkarsh,

It is the same setup with my MSVC2008 ParaView, where Qt is a prebuild release with MSVC2008 from

Very good catch!!! Does that mean I should either rebuild Qt with MSVC2010 or let ParaView build Qt along the way?

Hi Jerome,

It looks like the ParametricFunction property of the SplineSource is not
python friendly.  I can confirm this bug.  As a workaround, you can do this:

s.ParametricFunction.SetPropertyWithName("Closed", 1)
s.ParametricFunction.SetPropertyWithName("Points", [x,y,z, x2,y2,z2])

I think paraview will print an error message when you said the Points
property even though it works.  You'll see an error message that the spline
must contain at least 1 point.  My guess is that it clears the Points
property before setting the new value.

Extract the boundary in question. I have a vertex ID so that ID = 5 
indicates inflow boundary.
extract surface
connectivity
threshold (select ID = 5)
Hope this helps,

Hi,

It works like a charm! Thank you very much. You are right: I get the
expected error message, but the spline is correctly initialized.

Subject: [Paraview] Building VTK with shared libraries in ParaView
Message-ID: <AANLkTinXw0PxOFQMQfcbQLEK5b5Xffr1g8MX5PZe5M8n@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I set BUILD_SHARED_LIBS in CMAKE to TRUE when building ParaView. Does that
mean that when it's building VTK for ParaView, the VTK is built with shared
libraries?


I am building a test application that uses the VTK from ParaView and it
would only compile when I changed the setting for the test application to
static libraries (instead of shared libraries).

Thanks.

Yes, all libraries that ParaView builds including VTK will also be built
shared. Let us know if you need any more help.

Hi,
Maybe I missed something in your request but:
The VTK sources you can find in the ParaView source tree may be used
independently. I mean, no matter if you create a VTKBuild folder from
which you execute CMake by pointing on the VTK sources. This built may
have a totally different CMake configuration, such as STATIC instead
of SHARED. The cons is that you will have 2 built dir for VTK, one in
the ParaView built dir (the one with BUILD_SHARED_LIBS ON) and another
one in another place.

Your test application will then have to point the VTK_DIR to the right
VTK built dir in CMake.

HTH,
Jerome

Hello Stephen,

Thanks a lot for your answer. However I didn't succeed because my
regionid extracted from the connectivity filter are all 0. I am not
sure how to find out my vertex IDs, such as your ID = 5.

Can you give more explanation please? I greatly appreciate your help.

Best regards,
Wayne

Hi

I set BUILD_SHARED_LIBS in CMAKE to TRUE when configuring ParaView.

My test application uses the VTK library from ParaView. Here's the CMAKE
entry:

FIND_PACKAGE( VTK REQUIRED )
INCLUDE( ${VTK_USE_FILE} )
SET( VTK_LIBS vtkRendering vtkIO)

CMAKE autoloads the VTK directory as D:/alexisc/CompiledParaview/VTK

I checked that all the required dlls and libs are in
D:\alexisc\CompiledParaview\bin\Release

But when I compile my application in Microsoft Visual Studio I get the
following errors:

Creating library
D:\alexisc\CompiledVTKInteractionDevice\lib\Release\vtkInteractionDevice.lib
and object
D:\alexisc\CompiledVTKInteractionDevice\lib\Release\vtkInteractionDevice.exp
1>vtkVRPNTrackerStyleCamera.obj : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol

If I set the Configuration Properties->General->Project
Defaults->Configuration Type from .dll to .lib, the compilation works.

This means that it was able to detect vtkRendering.lib which is in
D:\alexisc\CompiledParaview\bin\Release

But the application will not start because of missing vtkRendering.dll which
is also in D:\alexisc\CompiledParaview\bin\Release

Do you have any idea why the application is not able to detect
vtkRendering.dll?

Thanks.

Hi

I just found this thread which answers my question:
http://www.cmake.org/pipermail/cmake/2004-December/005906.html

I put the ParaView bin directory in my System Path (Environment variable)
and my application is able to start.

Thanks.

Subject: [Paraview] scripting beginner
Message-ID: <4D5FD087.7020205@kit.edu>

Hi!

I am real beginner in paraview scripting. Up to now, I used the paraview 
graphic platform, but since the tasks are getting more complex, I wanted 
to use paraview scripting with python.... and failed.

What I want to do:
- Load .vts-data
- Create Contour
- Set Data Range
- Save State/Save Picture

I wrote the following script:

 >from paraview.simple import *
 >
 >reader = OpenDataFile(PATH+'lfff00300000p_QC.vts')
 >contourFilter = Contour(reader)
 >contourFilter.ContourBy = 'velocity'
 >contourFilter.Isosurfaces = [0.0005, 0.001]
 >Show(contourFilter)
 >ResetCamera()
 >WriteImage('picture.png')
 >servermanager.SaveState('pythonstate.pvsm')


If I run the script, two errors occur, probably with the same reason.
The writer says:
vtkSMRenderViewProxy (0x1e6da30): Disabling offscreen rendering since 
empty image was detected.

When I open the state, there is nothing displayed. in order to see 
anything, I do have to press "Apply" for the Contour filter and "Reset" 
for the Camera, then everything looks fine.

How can I implement, that these two operations are conducted?

Thanks, Hartwig

Without looking at the script in detail, have you tried using the Python Trace feature in the GUI? Since, at this stage anyway, all of your tasks are straight forward, you can do them in the GUI with the trace turned on, then look at the resulting script to show you how all of it is done. 

That is, by far, the easiest way to learn how to script Paraview.

Try the following script:

 >from paraview.simple import *
 >
 >rv = GetRenderView() # Get a connection to the render window
 >reader = OpenDataFile(PATH+'lfff00300000p_QC.vts')
 >reader.Update() # Actually read the file in and update the pipeline
 >contourFilter = Contour(reader)
 >contourFilter.ContourBy = 'velocity'
 >contourFilter.Isosurfaces = [0.0005, 0.001]
 >dr = Show() # Update the pipeline again, but we need to alter how it looks
 >lookupTable = CreateLookupTable( RBGPoints=[<minval to show>, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, <maxval to show>, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], VectorMode='Magnitude', ColorSpace='RGB', ScalarRangeInitialized=1.0) # This creates the color map, going from back to white
 >dr.ColorArrayName = '<data array name to show>' # Tell it how you want contours colored
 >dr.ColorAttributeType = '<POINT_DATA or CELL_DATA>' # Tell it the type of data it is coloring
 >ResetCamera()
 >WriteImage('picture.png')
 >servermanager.SaveState('pythonstate.pvsm')

That is something like what you need to do (I can't promise it works, but it will get you close -- I've never used a script with the Contour filter). Again, do what you are trying to do in the GUI with trace turned on and see what it outputs. You'll see some extra steps along the lines of what I added that should get you up and running.

Subject: [Paraview] scripting beginner

Hi!

I am real beginner in paraview scripting. Up to now, I used the paraview 
graphic platform, but since the tasks are getting more complex, I wanted 
to use paraview scripting with python.... and failed.

What I want to do:
- Load .vts-data
- Create Contour
- Set Data Range
- Save State/Save Picture

I wrote the following script:

 >from paraview.simple import *
 >
 >reader = OpenDataFile(PATH+'lfff00300000p_QC.vts')
 >contourFilter = Contour(reader)
 >contourFilter.ContourBy = 'velocity'
 >contourFilter.Isosurfaces = [0.0005, 0.001]
 >Show(contourFilter)
 >ResetCamera()
 >WriteImage('picture.png')
 >servermanager.SaveState('pythonstate.pvsm')


If I run the script, two errors occur, probably with the same reason.
The writer says:
vtkSMRenderViewProxy (0x1e6da30): Disabling offscreen rendering since 
empty image was detected.

When I open the state, there is nothing displayed. in order to see 
anything, I do have to press "Apply" for the Contour filter and "Reset" 
for the Camera, then everything looks fine.

How can I implement, that these two operations are conducted?

Thanks, Hartwig

Hi,

you forget to call Render() before and after the ResetCamera().

Hi Fabian,

I fixed a bug with python state.  Thank you very much for reporting.  This
should solve the problem you had with test.py.

I'm not sure what the problem is with pyCalculator.py.  I have test with the
python calculator with python trace, and I am confident that it works
correctly.  I suspect the problem may be something else, maybe the
interaction of the openfoam reader with the order of events you recorded
trace, it's hard to tell.  If you can repeat the problem with specific set
of steps, and send me your data, I could try taking a closer look.

Subject: [Paraview] Pvbatch with XDMF/HDF5 limitation
Message-ID: <1298305737.5789.1647.camel@hokuto>

Hi anybody,

I am trying to run a very simple python script:

from paraview.simple import *
servermanager.LoadState("state.pvsm")
view = servermanager.GetRenderView()
view.StillRender()
image="aux.png"
view.WriteImage(image,"vtkPNGWriter",1)

using pvbatch:

mpirun -np 8 pvbatch script.py

to obtain a png image from some data in a HDF5 file referenced from a
XDMF file specified in the state file. 

This is an extract of the XDMF file:

<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<!DOCTYPE Xdmf SYSTEM "Xdmf.dtd" []>
<Xdmf Version="2.0">
 <Domain>
  <Grid Name='grid' GridType='Collection' CollectionType='Spatial'>
   <Time Type='Single' Value='2.386'/>
   <Grid Name="core-0" GridType="Uniform">
	...data of core-0...
   <Grid Name="core-1" GridType="Uniform">
	...data of core-1...
...
...
...
   <Grid Name="core-151" GridType="Uniform">
	...data of core-151...
  </Grid>
 </Domain>
</Xdmf>

So there is an spatial collection with 152 groups because that is the
number of CPU's that worked in that simulation. Everything works fine if
the number of cpu's passed to mpirun is a factor of 152 (1, 2, 4, 8, 19,
38, 76 or 152), and it goes faster as more cpu's are used, but it does
nothing (not even crash or shows any error) if the number of cpu's is
not a factor of 152 (3, 5, 6, 17, 151, etc.). Is this the expected
behavior or am I doing something wrong?

I have also found that with new 3.10 RC1 version the overall performance
when generating images in this way has decreased when compared with
3.8.1 version. 
Has anybody experienced something similar?

Thanks in advance.
Regards,

I am assuming that you have already got your volume rendering working in serial.

At first glance, I can see that the IceT parallel render manager is in the wrong compositing mode.  By default, the manager uses a z buffer comparison as its composite operation.  That works great for opaque surfaces, but does not work at all for transparent objects (as is the case for volume rendering).  In fact, I believe most of the volume rendering algorithms write nothing in the z buffer, so IceT will assume that nothing is rendered and throw away all your rendered pixels.

You need to tell the parallel render manager to do alpha blending.  Because alpha blending is order dependent, you also have to tell the parallel render manager the spatial decomposition of your data.  You do that by creating a vtkPKdTree to the parallel render manager (if I remember right).

Message-ID: <32334E4678832243A6ADB7520A6BDAA86F9739@metrs1.Mail_Pauer.loc>

Hello,

 

I'm using Paraview 3.8.1 64bit on an openSuse 11.3 system. When calculation an integral value of one of the patches by using the "Integrate Variables" filter I am able to increase the number of displayed digits by modifying the precision entry in the filter window as described in 

 

   http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Displaying_Data#Header

 

But this does not affect the number of digits in the *.csv file created by File->Save Data. Here are only six non zero digits written. Is there any possibility to increase the number of digits, maybe by a modification of the source code? 

 

I need to save a higher number of digits than six to evaluate the fluctuation of an integrated pressure value. As the fluctuation is small compared to the absolute value most of the digits does never change. The fluctuation is only indicated by one digit. I know there is a work-around by using the calculator to subtract the not changing offset, but I would prefer a straight foreword solution by  increasing the number of digits written by File->Save Data.

 

Thank you very much for an advice!

ParaView uses Servers/Filters/vtkCSVWriter.h|cxx as the CSV writer.
You should be able to change the vtkCSVWriterGetDataString()
implementations to change the precision.

	Visualization
Message-ID: <AANLkTin8jXDKOzeGPn3eByHUD754Sxy1O_-GJ1TiRBn7@mail.gmail.com>

CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

IEEE Symposium on Large-Scale Data Analysis and Visualization

VisWeek 2011 in Providence, RI

October 23-24, 2011

Website: http://www.ldav.org/

In many areas of science, simulations and experiments begin to
generate many petabytes of data, with some sciences facing exabytes of
data near term. Similarly, the collection of information about the
Internet applications and users for a variety of purposes is
generating only more data. Our ability to manage, mine, analyze, and
visualize the data is fundamental to the knowledge discovery
process. That is, the value of data at extreme scale can be fully
realized only if we have an end-to-end solution, which demands a
collective, inter-disciplinary effort to develop.

This new symposium, held in conjunction with VisWeek 2011, aims at
bringing together domain scientists, data analytics and visualization
researchers, and users, and fostering the needed exchange to develop
the next-generation data-intensive analysis and visualization
technology. Attendees will be introduced to the latest and greatest
research innovations in large data management, analysis, and
visualization, learn how these innovations impact data intensive
computing and knowledge discovery, and also learn about the critical
issues in creating a complete solution through both invited and
contributed talks, panel discussion, and a large data visualization
contest that provides massive data and supercomputing time to
contestants. Paper submissions are solicited for a long paper event
that describes large data visualization techniques and systems, and a
short paper event for practitioners to describe and present their
large data visualization applications. Topic emphasis is on
algorithms, languages, systems and hardware that supports the analysis
and visualization of large data.

There are a variety of ways to participate in LDAV 2011 -- papers,
posters, and a vis contest. ?For details, please see http://www.ldav.org.

We hope to see you there!

Paper Submission Deadline: April 14, 2011 (Abstracts due April 7th)
Poster Submission Deadline: July 15h, 2011
Contest Submission Deadline: July 29, 2011

Subject: [Paraview] Error reading ascii data
Message-ID: <AANLkTim92N_TotiRGLv_mPQxPqqvstDdyY_4oBZdt0aQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I use Elmer to simulate under Ubuntu, and the results are saved as vtk
files. I can really view these files under Ubuntu with ParaView 3.4.0;
the low version number is due to apt-get. However, when I view them on
my Mac with ParaView 3.10, I got the error saying "Error reading ascii
data. Possible mismatch of datasize with declaration", and some data
could not be correctly displayed. See attached picture.

I also tried 3.10 under Windows, there is no such problem.

I found this thread,
http://www.mail-archive.com/paraview at paraview.org/msg04625.html
I am not sure whether it is due to regional settings, because all of
my computers are with UK region.

Any of you encountered this problem? Any ideas to solve it?

Thanks a lot in advance.

Best regards,
Wayne

Subject: [Paraview] Memory leak in version 3.10 RC1
Message-ID: <1298399843.9285.34.camel@hokuto>

Hi anybody,
I am trying to generate images loading different states from a python
script but it takes more and more memory each time it loads a new state.
This is the script:
from paraview.simple import *

ifile=open("file_states")
counter=1
for line in ifile:
        name=line[:-1]
        servermanager.LoadState(name)
        view = servermanager.GetRenderView()
        view.StillRender()
        output='image-'+str("%05d"%counter)+'.png'
        view.WriteImage(output,"vtkPNGWriter",1)
        Delete(view)
        del view
        counter+=1
ifile.close()

I am not sure if it's necessary to delete something more before loading
a new state, but if I try to do something that I think is very similar
with the GUI:
1. Load a state.
2. Click to Edit->Delete All.
3. Repeat from 1.

The memory usage grows too with each new load.

I have tried to reproduce this problem with version 3.8.0-1 and it works
fine, the memory usage stays the same with each new load of a state. 

Can anybody confirm this behavior?
Thanks in advance.
Regards,

Subject: [Paraview] Enzo data
Message-ID: <AANLkTikNR8-C59Vgwe8soHB+jejc2Oro1h9q522COB=b@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm somewhat new to ParaView, and I'm trying to load up Enzo data with
3.10.0-RC1.  I am able to open the Enzo .hierarchy file, but upon
loading I am greeting with numerous errors (one for every .cpu file,
in fact) of the type:

ERROR: In /Users/partyd/Kitware/ParaView-3.10/source/Servers/Filters/vtkEnzoReader.cxx,
line 1965
vtkEnzoReader (0x122c2e5a0): Failed to open particles file .\DD0252.cpu0062

which end up with the block structure existing, but no data being made
available.  Looking in the .hierarchy file, under the entry for the
CPU 0062 file (for instance, but this is true for all of the files) I
see:

--
Grid = 63
Task              = 62
GridRank          = 3
GridDimension     = 70 70 70
GridStartIndex    = 3 3 3
GridEndIndex      = 66 66 66
GridLeftEdge      = 0.5 0 0
GridRightEdge     = 0.75 0.25 0.25
Time              = 630.69842031748
SubgridsAreStatic = 0
NumberOfBaryonFields = 12
FieldType = 0 1 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 19
BaryonFileName = DD0252.cpu0062
CourantSafetyNumber    = 0.500000
PPMFlatteningParameter = 0
PPMDiffusionParameter  = 0
PPMSteepeningParameter = 0
NumberOfParticles   = 285659
ParticleFileName = DD0252.cpu0062
GravityBoundaryType = 0
Pointer: Grid[63]->NextGridThisLevel = 64
--

The .hierarchy file is including references relative to the .hierarchy
file, and I can verify that these files are there.  My guess is that
these are being translated to using the windows-style path delimiter
(as seen above in the error message), and a brief examination of
Servers/Filters/vtkEnzoReader.cxx suggests that this *may* be the
case, as on lines 66 and 67 the delimiter is set to be "\" with these
lines:

#define     ENZO_READER_SLASH_CHAR    '\\'
#define     ENZO_READER_SLASH_STRING  "\\"

I'm not entirely sure how the ParaView reader internals work, but I
was wondering if somebody could give me a hint about this?  Am I
loading the file wrong?

Thanks very much for any ideas!

Best,

Matt

Hi Matt,

This issue has been fixed, however, the
changes have not been merged yet with master.

They will be available soon if you can wait. Otherwise,
if you would like to try it out, I will be happy to push
my branch to gitorious for you to try it out.

Best,
George

Hi George,

Ah, great to hear.  I don't mind waiting for RC2, but if you happen to
have a patch/changeset I can apply/update to that would be great.

Thanks!

Subject: [Paraview] Coordinates
Message-ID: <503053.11531.qm@web30408.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hi,
I am trying to adjust the produced images from Paraview according to certain 
coordinates that I have, I made 4 probelocations for the 4 points I need my 
image to be in between, but I wasn't able to produce the image in the same view, 
kind of the probelocations are either smaller than the produced images or out of 
the produced image.
Any idea how to adjust that, also I want to know how to adjust it in the python 
tracing file as well.
Thanks for your help,
-Hussein

Subject: [Paraview] Viewing volumetric images
Message-ID: <AANLkTincNE-Us_cTBRNSWrrGgsMEtmGHxw+_ZmBDC-MH@mail.gmail.com>

Hello.

I switched to version 3.10.0 and observed that viewing volumetric images is
buggy.

When I open a .mha file and choose Volume as a view option (instead of
Outline) I correctly see the result. Rotating or zooming  the volume,
however, causes the volume to disappear from the window.

I did not observe that behavior for version 3.8.1.

I am using Ubuntu with paraview binaries.

Regards,
Panagiotis Foteinos

Hi Wayne,

Can you share an example dataset? If it is too big for the list and
you don't have a place to upload it, you can send it directly to me.

Subject: [Paraview] Problem with LIC representation in PV3.10-RC1
Message-ID: <A52E7EF9CCB542A89C5E710DF896FCF0@win.ara>



I just had a problem where I had my data loaded in and was visualising it
using Surface representation. During this, ParaView crashed with a Floating
Point Exception. However, when I restarted ParaView and I tried to reload
the dataset, it would just crash to desktop with an error relating to
vtkSurfaceLICRepresentation. It appears that it was trying to display using
the Surface LIC representation, but there are no vectors contained within
the dataset. I got round it by disabling the SurfaceLIC plugin in the .ini
file. It would be worth having an option in the .ini file that allows you to
specify a default representation, or is there another way around this?

Adriano

Were you loading a state file or something? ParaView will never use
'SurfaceRepresentation" as the default representation.

No, I opened a fresh version of ParaView, I navigated and selected the mesh
file and when I clicked apply, it crashed out with the
vtkSurfaceLICRepresentation error message:
 
ERROR: In /path/to/ParaView-3.10.0-RC1/Servers/Common/vtkProcessModule.cxx,
line 1095
vtkProcessModule (0x1047a150): Cannot create object of type
"vtkSurfaceLICRepresentation".
while processing
Message 0 = New
  Argument 0 = string_value {vtkSurfaceLICRepresentation}
  Argument 1 = id_value {326}

The irony is that, although I remember creating a vector before the crash,
at no point did I switch the representation to SurfaceLIC.

Looks like the problem is that the plugin didn't get loaded correctly.
It's possible  that ParaView picked up the wrong plugin by default. We
have fixes for this logic that should make it into 3.10 release.

I see this too. I compiled 3.10.0 from source on Ubuntu. I'm loading vtk
files and volume rendering, and any action on the view causes the rendering
to disappear... and it's kinda hard to get it back. Other views (outline,
etc) do not seem to be affected.

Subject: [Paraview] Error using Python Trace in PV3.10-RC1
Message-ID: <EFDDB10351B84D52B305154788B4C5A5@win.ara>


I found a problem using the Python Trace functionality with PV3.10-RC1. I've
loaded in a dataset and started a trace. I then proceeded to take a slice
through the dataset, which worked fine. Next, in the animation view, I added
a cue based on the x-value of the slice origin. Double-clicking on the
scalar bar gives the pop up window to set the start and end values. At this
point, I can't change any of the values and ParaView just hangs. This only
appears to happen with the variables that are essentially vector components
(Normals and Origin); I can modify the scalar options without it crashing.

I did manage to get around the problem by adding one of the vector
components as a track BEFORE starting the trace and then deleting it
immediately. I can then start the trace, add the track again (or any of the
options), modify its values without ParaView crashing.

Regards,

Adriano

That's very odd. Any issues with OpenGL drivers? Are they all
up-to-date, working correctly?

OpenGL is indeed up-to-date and working, though I do notice that direct
rendering is not. It should be for some of the other stuff I do, but I don't
know if Paraview will rely on it or not (?). So I'll try a reboot when I get
chance and see if that resolves it, but I'm sure that it (direct rendering)
was working last week and the Paraview thing was not...

OpenGL is up to date and works fine in my machine. Direct rendering is on.

I repeat that Paraview 3.8.1 works like a charm; Version 3.10.0 has this
problem.

Does this have anything to do with the fancy "effects" that Ubuntu
has? Does disabling them make this any better?

Paraview developers with Ubuntu desktops may want to comment.

Nope,
disabling the visual effects did not solve the problem.

Subject: [Paraview] Viewing of 3D image data on object data with paraview
Message-ID: <AANLkTik5kK=CGF7KNxyjGB0LjJjbwB=ER5tm2rsJ2YKi@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I asked a related question a couple of years ago but never found a
good answer. I need to revisit it now.

I'd like to view image data plus track data in paraview. The track
data is produced as list of points in world coordinates. I can convert
these to vtk objects and load them.

My problem is viewing the image data so that it is placed correctly
relative to the tracks. The transformations in the image header can be
used in ITK to locate voxel values at then ends of tracks, so I think
they are set correctly, however they appear to be ignored by paraview.
My very rough check was to use the ruler to determine the coordinates
of image corners. One of these was zero, so the header information was
being ignored, as the origin was somewhere near the brain image
centre.

One option appears to be to convert the transformation information
from the image header to the transform array in the image Display
panel, which is a bit tedious. I'm wondering whether there are 3D
image formats that can be viewed using volume rendering in paraview
that might do this automatically. So far I've been using mha files
created using the ITK too ConvertBetweenImageFormats from nifti.

Alternatively, does anyone have some other procedure for viewing
combinations of image and mesh/line objects in paraview?

Thanks Jean - I also found this example when looking through the mailing
list:

8<---------------------------------------------------
try: paraview.simple
except: from paraview.simple import *

Sphere()
view = paraview.simple._create_view("SpreadSheetView")
Show()
Render()
exporters = servermanager.createModule("exporters")
csvExporter = exporters.CSVExporter(FileName="/tmp/test.csv", View=view)
csvExporter.Write()
--------------------------------------------------->8

It would be nice if it worked from the trace (and without having to create a
spreadsheet

Agreed. I don't have the effects enabled. I should also add that this
feature was new to the 3.10 release for me, too. It used to work.

However... (and maybe this is a newbie mistake on my part?)... the problem
goes away completely if I change the "Volume mapper" to "GPU" instead of
"Fixed Point". That solves it for me!

Out of interest (and not to hijack this thread), what are those two options
for? What difference do they make (aside from fixing this problem)?

Thanks,
Karl

Subject: [Paraview] Parallel data, ghost points and clean to grid
Message-ID: <AANLkTin1K5pLLL_QE9phhaU-bVOeZX7e7HaH9wCZyi-F@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everybody (long time no posting messages here...)

I'm writing to revive a very old problem I have when visualizing parallel
data.

When we load parallel data (pieces of model given to several processes/cpus)
the image appears with some "artifacts". In fact, these artifacts are just
the parallel interface among processes (in other words, shared data).
Something like this:
http://www.nacad.ufrj.br/~rnelias/paraview/before-clean-to-grid.png

The "Clean to Grid Filter" can be used to remove these artifacts (and, in
fact, it really happens if we use the filter).
http://www.nacad.ufrj.br/~rnelias/paraview/after-clean-to-grid.png

Ok, so..., what's the problem?

The problem is that "Clean to Grid" seems to be unable in producing ghost
point information in order to combine scalar and vector fields and the
results are not shown correctly (
http://www.nacad.ufrj.br/~rnelias/paraview/problem.png)

Some possible solution I could imagine:

-- Supply ghost information to ParaView. Ok, it would be the best solution,
the question is: -- Does Xdmf format already support it? What about Ensight?

-- Force Clean To Grid Filter guess about the ghost point (in my case,
they'll be always those points removed by clean to grid by default)

Any other idea?

Thanks

The two options are different implementations of the volume rendering
algorithms -- one is a pure CPU implementation while other is a
GPU-based implementation.

I believe the problem stems from the fact that although ITK supports
associating transforms with ImageData itself, VTK and subsequently
ParaView do not. If you look at vtkImageData class
(http://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkImageData.html), you
notice that there's no API for setting/getting transform. Thus no
reader in VTK or ParaView can read and pass that information through
the pipeline and eventually render using that transform.

As you mentioned, the easiest work around is to manually translate the
transform to values to the "transform" properties on the display tab.

BTW, ParaView does include a contributed Nifti reader plugin that you
can load to read in nifti files directly.

Subject: [Paraview] running plugin with ParaView git + Qt 4.7.1
Message-ID: <7F7CB2A87C76454FA8409EA326FC02971E4409BA@exch-mbx1.ad.renci.org>

Hello,
I have built ParaView from source with Qt 4.7.1. Except CMake complaining about 4.7 is not officially supported, the building process went smoothly.
Now I tried to load a plugin I developed which ran fine under ParaView git build + Qt 4.6.3. I did rebuild that plugin from the ground up by linking it against the new paraview git build + Qt 4.7.1. However, the plugin manager told me
"Load Error, Cannot load library ***/my_plugin.dll: The specified procedure could not be found."

Any suggestions? Thanks a lot.

Best,
xunlei

Hi Odile,
that's great to know. I was about to build a Qt4.6.3 versioned ParaView.
What exactly the environment variables is your script setting up?
Thanks a lot.

Hello,

I recompiled everything including  my plugins (readers, filters) and every thing works fine.
I use Qt 4.7.1, ParaView 3_9 git and I supported Windows XP and Linux Fedora 12 64 bits.

I start ParaView using a script including all the required environment  variables.

For now, ParaView 3_9 is test at our Institut.

Bonne journ?e :-)

There won't be development binaries for the RC. They will follow shortly

Hi All,

I wonder if someone knows how to adjust saving the Paraview pictures according 
to certain coordinates and excluding everything else in the view so that its 
easily adjusted with Google Earth? Please let me know if you have information 
related to that.

Thanks,

Hi,
Can I build Xdmf2 as a standalone library without building ParaView instead?
I tried to configure Xdmf2 (git source under Utilities/Xdmf2) and 
encountered these CMake errors

    CMake Warning (dev) in CMakeLists.txt:
       No cmake_minimum_required command is present.  A line of code such as

       if you wish to support older CMake versions for this project. 
    For more
       information run "cmake --help-policy CMP0000".
    This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.

The xdmf repository has two branches one for ParaView and other for
standalone. You have to checkout "master" branch explicitly from the
xmdf repository to build xdmf standalone.

Hi Utkarsh,
Never mind. I had some issues before by doing
git clone git://paraview.org/Xdmf.git
That's why I extracted Xdmf2 portion from the ParaView tree. Now the 
above line works just fine.
Thanks a lot for the help.
Best,

Subject: [Paraview] Using pvrenderserver and pvdataserver
Message-ID: <AANLkTimhDKvLTKFzyAtkGEMtD4Bhbbf2PPzjF+asii4U@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I am trying to understand how I can use pvrenderserver and pvdataserver
instead of pvserver to handle rendering on my gpu node. This is going to be
a "Nvidia's Tesla Deskside Supercomputer" which is connected, though an
interface card/PCI Express connection, to my desktop. I have already worked
with pvserver so I know some of the basics. What I don't know is how I
should tell paraview to run pvrenderserver on the gpu and pvdataserver on
cpu?

Is it like I should run both on the rank 0 processor (its a quadcore
processor) and the processor will automatically manage to send the render
information to the gpu? Or do I need to do something more sophisticated?

Any help is greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Mohammad

Hi, 

I wonder if one can interface with Paraview via sockets/Pipes etc? 
I have an application that is used to analyze dynamic simulation results, 
thus I have many hundred time varying data sets and an application select 
and view the data sets in a simple way.
Now I want to use Paraview to visualize and analyze a subset of all the 
data in more detail. Preferably by sending/updating data through an 
network interface. 

Is this possible? 
If yes, how?

Subject: [Paraview] problems using parallel paraview in client/server mode
Message-ID: <SNT123-W8545C54C3155DCA15A4AABCDD0@phx.gbl>


Dear all,

I'm encountering problems using Paraview in Client/Server Mode. I'm using ParaView 3.8.0-RC2, the remote system where the pvserver is started, is Gentoo Linux 4.4.3 and the client is started on my local Windows XP. 

The connection is established without problems and I have access to the remote directories. 
My data is stored in the Xdmf-Data format, so one file contains the grid and one or more attribute data associated with it. Opening the file and viewing the first variable is no problem, but changing to another set of attribute data leads to the Error

Warning: In ..\..\..\src\Servers\Filters\vtkTexturePainter.cxx, line 173
vtkTexturePainter (06F2A2B0): Failed to locate selected scalars. Will use image scalars by default.

and whereas the information about the data range is correct, the image is just one color and definitly not correct. 

It seems to be a parallelization problem, since starting the pvserver on just one node and connecting, I encounter no such problems. 


I've tried to connect with ParaView 3.8.1,, but starting the 3.8.1 pvserver, I get the error  

./pvserver: symbol lookup error: /usr/lib64/qt4/libQtWebKit.so.4: undefined symbol: _ZN15QGraphicsObject16staticMetaObjectE

Is that saying I need to update my Qt? Im using Qt version 4.6.2. 

Thanks for helping,
Natalie

Hi,

I switched to Paraview 3.10.0 RC1 (downloaded from the website) and I get
the following error when saving animation as a .avi file:

Generic Warning: In
/home/kitware/Projects/ParaView-3.10/source/VTK/IO/vtkFFMPEGWriter.cxx, line

Could not open codec.

I noticed this error only when I give frame rate >1. I am able to save
animation successfully if I give frame rate as 1fps.
I am using Ubuntu 10.04, and I tried out saving animation of camera in orbit
around the contour of a wavelet.
Is there a fix or a workaround?

Thanks

Subject: [Paraview] Glyph orient vs. vector_components
Message-ID: <E1Pt3po-0004qd-73@cosmos.phy.tufts.edu>

The Glyph property Scale Mode = vector_components allows you to
display different information in the different dimensions of a glyph.
For example, I can draw arrows whose thickness tells me about one
property of my points while their length tells me about another.  But
then I cannot orient the arrows.  The vector whose components I'm
using has to have the length in the x component, because that is the
direction in which the arrow glyph points, so I cannot use the
direction of this vector for something else.

It would be useful to have the ability to orient based on one vector
while scaling based on another.

Message-ID: <4D6AAEC1.6060209@web.de>

I'd like to know the difference between CoProcessing and the following 
feature that is currently being implemented:

http://paraview.uservoice.com/forums/11350-general/suggestions/456005-writing-to-paraview-from-an-external-program?ref=title

 From a cursory glance and my experience with other 3d apps (namely 
AutoDesk Maya) I find the current CoProcessing(?) implementation a bit 
too complicated.

AutoDesk Maya, a highend 3d animation program, has a commandPort feature 
that very simple to use. All it requires is a single command that 
creates a socket and binds a specified port number to it. Thereafter any 
external app can send commands to Maya in its primary scripting language 
(MEL) and I suspect now also python. For example, I've configured my 
toolchain/IDE (Visual Studio) to send Maya a command, via the 
commandPort channel, to unload plugins before attempting to rebuild 
them. After building the toolchain/IDE sends another command to Maya 
asking it to reload the plugin. Basically, any scripting command that 
Maya accepts can be sent by and external app via the commandPort.

http://download.autodesk.com/us/maya/2011help/CommandsPython/commandPort.html

Can communication between Paraview and external apps be made this simple?

Hi

I am interested in implementing multiple views (multiple interactors and

http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Multiple_views

But I cannot find vtkSMMultiViewRenderModuleProxy  in my clone of the

Has the class been deprecated?

Subject: [Paraview] vtkSocket bugs
Message-ID: <4D6ACDD2.8010101@lbl.gov>

Hi,

While installing ParaView on Nautilus, 
http://www.nics.tennessee.edu/computing-resources/nautilus, I hit a bug 
in vtkSocket that prevents ParaView from running on this machine. While 
tracking this down I uncovered a couple related issues.

The main issue is that vtkSocket does not handle EINTR. EINTR occurs 
when a signal is caught by the application during a blocking socket 
call. While ParaView does not make use of signals they are used for 
asynchronous communication by some SGI specific libraries on Nautilus 
that are linked in with SGI MPI. Because Rank 0 pvserver spends quite a 
bit of its time blocked in socket calls it only takes a few 10s of 
seconds for EINTR to occur. When faced with EINTR ParaView silently 
exits leaving the user wondering what the heck happened. Which brings me 
to the second issue, a lack of error reporting in vtkSocket.

To solve the first issue vtkSocket has to handle EINTR. How EINTR should 
be handled depends on the specific socket call. For all calls except 
connect the call can simply be restarted. For EINTR during connect one 
can't restart the call on all unix, so instead one must block in a 
select call when connect fails with EINTR. To be portable across Unix 
one should handle EINTR in all socket calls, even simple ones like 
set/getsockopt.

The second issue of error reporting applies to all socket related errors 
in general, my feeling is that when a socket call fails vtkSocket should 
print a message using vtkErrorMacro, errno, and strerror(or windows 
equivalent) at the point of failure. I think this should be done inside 
vtkSocket because this is the only place one can safely assume errno has 
relevant information and vtkSocket has been implemented returning a 
single error code, -1, so that returning the real error code would 
change the API and break existing code, including ParaView. Not to 
mention that the values for error codes are apparently different on 
windows and unix.

I took a stab at fixing these issues, patches attached. I tested them on 
my workstation, nautilus, and laptop running xp. I ran a dashboard on my 
linux workstation and didn't see any related issues. Would someone at KW 
mind taking a look at the changes and see if it could be made permanent?

By the way after testing all socket calls for error returns I uncovered 
a third bug, vtkSocket::Close didn't set the descriptor ivar to -1 which 
resulted in vtkSocket::~vtkSocket calling close on a closed socket. Not 
a disasterous error, but this reinforces my opinion that the returns 
should be tested and error messages printed.

Thanks
Burlen

Co-processing might or might not be what I was looking for!? 

However, I do not fully understand the functionality. Some questions that 
someone might be able to answer:
1. Do I need to link with the VTK libraries? This seems a bit heavy since 
I just want to send some data and commands to Paraview.
2. It seems that I need to setup Paraview before using co-processing, 
i.e., load a simulation result that is similar to the data I want to 
analyze, correct? This is not very flexible. I would like to send commands 
to Paraview to perform the setup. 
3. I would also like to read the current Paraview state (setup) through 
the interface and store it, is this possible? 
4. I do not understand "coprocessing library determines if any 
coprocessing needs to be performed at time step i", how can the library 
determine anything that is related to my data?

Thanks 
Alexander

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview/pvserver running very slow
Message-ID: <6cb5391a8f24750e94d92006cf90f295@localhost>


Hello,

I?m running paraview 3.8.1 under linux using 8 cpus loading a 
reconstructed openfoam case with about 13GB per timestep (we have just 
two time steps, start 0 and result 1). The machine on which pvserver 
runs has 16 cpus and 70GB RAM, but pvserver uses just a small fraction 
of the ram.

Loading the case takes about 5 minutes (which would be fine, if 
subsequent operations were running more smoothly).
Adding a slice takes another couple of minutes. Rotating (using the 
mouse) takes about 10sec for one frame to be rendered (the slice is 
constant colored). Computing 100 streamlines from a line source takes 
about 10 minutes, moving the view is fluent. As soon as the slice is 
displayed moving the view becomes extremely slow again.

I have also tried to convert the mesh to VTK which does not really 
change something. (Resulting VTK is of 37GB size).

At this state interactive work is not possible. Since the dataset is 
not extraordinary large (I think), I suspect a problem with our MPI 
configuration.

Offscreen rendering works (I think), we have 8 windows "Visualization 
Toolkit ? OpenGL" that opens on the client (though the windows remain 
black).

MPI implementation is SGI MPI. I have also tried to compile openmpi 
1.4.3 and pvserver from source, yet it?s still very slow. The client 
used is the x64 build from the paraview homepage.

MPI setup is for local use only.

I am grateful for any help?

Florian

Our current workflow is to compute on 128 cores and do postprocessing
on 4 to 12 cores. Therefore a decomposed case would consist of 128
processors directories. Would it still be advisable to postprocess with
just 8 cores? Since we're stil testing paraview (currently using another
postprocessing tool) our workflow is not well adapted for paraview)

However, I think this would affect only the load times, not slow
rendering when moving the view, would it?

CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE = Release was set on my own build which is very slow
too. I am not sure about the production build linked against SGI MPI,
but I suppose it is enabled.

Florian

In some ways you can think of ParaView as an abstraction for using VTK in an
easier fashion in parallel.  Also ParaView is responsible for the
client-server communication among other things.  What do you want ParaView
to do that it wouldn't use VTK for?  There has been some work on only
including the necessary parts of the VTK library when doing coprocessing
when linking statically.  If you're interested in that I can get you more
information.

You can hard code a ParaView python pipeline script or C++ pipeline script.
Using the coprocessing script generator plugin is designed more for analysts
that aren't that comfortable coding and would rather set up their problem
through a gui.

Maybe I'm not sure what you mean about this but this is what the
coprocessing script generator plugin is for.  I imagine the ParaView state
could be used for this but there'd probably have to be some extra
information passed in.



> 4. I do not understand "coprocessing library determines if any

During the coprocessing script generation the user must enter how often data
is to be outputted (e.g. what time steps).  More complex logic could be
added (e.g. when total energy hits a certain value, when velocity is in a
specified range) but that would be rather difficult to do in a generic way.
The vtkCPPipeline::RequestDataDescription method is the one responsible for
determining if a pipeline wants to do coprocessing during a specific time
step.

Hope this helps.

What exactly are you trying to do? vtkSMMultiViewRenderModuleProxy is
deprecated, but it was never meant to be used directly anyways -- one
simply created a view proxy and used it. Which is still true. Simply
create multiple "RenderView" proxies and set "ViewPosition" and
"ViewSize" properties on them to set up the layout.

Florian,

Is there any reason you prefer to load such a big case with
reconstructed?  The OpenFOAM reader (and subsequent filters) runs in
parallel only for decomposed cases. For reconstructed cases the reader
loads everything in process 0.

Also, are you sure you built ParaView with compiler optimizations
(CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE = Release)?

Message-ID: <AANLkTim00s0M6EdFWEGruaCdsoBHhpzWbeHAR1M=_noL@mail.gmail.com>

I am helping a colleague build ParaView on their Mac running OS X 10.5.8 and
running into an error with the libIOKit. At first I thought it might have
something to do with PV; later I thought perhaps not as it happened with
both ParaView 3.8 and 3.10.

ParaView 3.10.0 RC1 (with XCode + system tools 3.1.2, later still with
upgraded 3.1.4+tools):

This with paraview 3.8.1  (with XCode + system tools 3.1.2, later still with
upgraded 3.1.4+tools):

Has anyone run into something similar?

I would expect SGI MPT to out perform others if run on an SGI system...

I'm not sure what this means?

If you are running the client on one machine and the server on another, 
you shouldn't see the OpenGL windows popping up on the client when you 
are remote rendering. From this it sounds like all the rendering is 
occurring on your client which would be very slow.

You should verify that you are not X11 forwarding, don't have -X or -Y 
in your ssh commands.

You should verify that you use --use-offscreen-rendering on the pvserver 
command line.

There is also one setting in the client that can cause local rendering 
and you should explicitly turn it off, Edit->Settings...->Render 
View->Server->Remote Render Threshold = checked, and slider is 0MB.

Also in Edit->Settings...->Render View->Server you would get improved 
frame rate by using zlib when remote rendering, I'd say use at least 
level 6. I usually use the presets for consumer broadband/dsl which give 
a nice speed up when connecting over the internet.

Does your server system have GPUs? If not you could explicitly disable 
X11 in the pvserver build. I'm pasting a configure for a remote pvserver 
only build for remote offscreen only rendering no gpus.

Recently while working on fixing a bug for some of the VisIt readers I
learned of H5_USE_16_API which apparently you can define before including
hdf5.h in order to use 1.6 API. At least that's my understanding. Give it a
try! please feel free to let me know if I am wrong ;-)

Subject: [Paraview] Saving Images

Hi, Ken and Utkarsh.

I'm not 100% sure I understand the padding.  If something special is 
needed to get nice pictures out of some misbehaving graphics cards, that 
makes sense.  However, here's my $0.02 from a user's perspective.

The image produced via padding should match, pixel for pixel, the same 
image produced without any padding (except for viewport crossing 
polygons on misbehaving graphics cards).  For a specific image size in 
pixels, camera location/orientation, and field of view angle, the image 
is uniquely defined, and should look identical, whether rendered in 
ParaView, some CAD program, or a ray tracer.  In my opinion, padding is 
fine, so long as the user never knows about it.

Correctness of the image is very important to what I do, especially when 
splicing images/scenes together for a movie.  For example, while testing 
and setting up a scene, I might render it at a low resolution (so save 
time and disk space), and then in a production run, rerender after  
multiply that resolution by integer factors of 2 or 3 and average down 
for fine lines and antialiased edges.  But if the original and 
downsampled images have different zooms, I'm stuck with visual 
discontinuity in my movie.

In the save dialogs (screenshot or animation), I would like the default 
pixel dimensions to match the exact dimensions of the 3D view in 
paraview (or, ideally, even stay the same as the last thing I typed in, 
with a button to reset to the dimensions of the 3D view, so there's no 
need to re-type them every time a screenshot is taken).   Any padded 
numbers should happen behind the scene, and not be exposed through the 
dialogs boxes.

Also, automatically adjusting resolutions to nice multiples of 16 or 
whatever makes movie codecs happy is a nice feature.  However, there are 
cases where this gets in the way.  It would be nice to have a checkbox 
so the user has the option to allow this or not.

Thanks for considering this.

Greg

I just found that a short while ago. I think there may be clashes with
xdmf if you enable this define. Just something to be aware of.

Thanks
