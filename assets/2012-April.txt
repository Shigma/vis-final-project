Subject: [Paraview] Pick exact points on nodes
Message-ID: <981F621C-BC4C-433F-9E4D-6D081FBFCE88@mac.com>

Hi, everyone.


I want to probe nodes' values and major distances between 2 nodes.
ParaView's functions such as Point Source, Probe Location,
Ruler can pick points on sources, but they seem not to be able to
pick sources' nodes exactly.
How can I do them?

Message-ID: <4F795A88.6010907@tu-dresden.de>

Is there a bug in computing integrals for 3D domains? In 2D, the filter 
"Integral variables" works fine. For 3D domains, the result is always 
wrong (mostly near 0).

Subject: [Paraview] PVPython: paraview.vtk not the same as vtk
Message-ID: <4F79F2AE.2000009@cs.unc.edu>


I've got a question concerning ParaView and VTK Python scripts.  My goal 
is to generate some test data in the form of .vti files.  Using the VTK 
Python module, I can run the following script to generate a test datafile:

	#!/usr/bin/env python
	import vtk

	da = vtk.vtkFloatArray()
	da.SetName('myarray')
	da.SetNumberOfComponents(1)
	da.SetNumberOfTuples(1000)
	for i in xrange(1000):
		da.SetComponent(i,0,99.9)
	print da.GetClassName()

	image = vtk.vtkImageData()
	image.SetDimensions(10,10,10)
	image.GetPointData().AddArray(da)

	writer = vtk.vtkXMLImageDataWriter()
	fn = '/tmp/out.vti'
	writer.SetFileName(fn)
	writer.SetInput(image)
	writer.Update()


To speed things up, I want to use the vtk.dataset_adapter submodule from 
the ParaView Python libraries.  The function numpyTovtkDataArray   will 
translate a numpy array into a vtkDataArray.  This should speed thigns 
up considerably.

	#####################
	## run with pvpython
	#####################
	import paraview.vtk.dataset_adapter
	import paraview.vtk
	import numpy

	na = numpy.zeros((1000,), dtype=numpy.float32)
	na[:] = 99.9
	da = paraview.vtk.dataset_adapter.numpyTovtkDataArray(na)
	da.SetName('myarray')
	print da.GetClassName()

	image = paraview.vtk.vtkImageData()
	image.SetDimensions(10,10,10)
	image.GetPointData().AddArray(da)

	writer = paraview.vtk.vtkXMLImageDataWriter()
	writer.SetFileName('/tmp/out.vti')
	writer.SetInput(image)
	writer.Update()
	#####################

Unfortunately, this tends to fail because 
paraview.vtk.vtkXMLImageDataWriter does not exist.

The only way I can get this to work is to install both VTK and ParaView 
and mix calls to the paraview.vtk the vtk modules.  This seems 
redundant.  Is there a better way?

Thanks,

Subject: [Paraview] ccmake error when building example custom application
Message-ID: <CAPeaKqj8Q6VUGo=cQHGBrZVgdLLDQiNAYvaiqmGZe+FNbhXASQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm trying to build the example custom application Clone1. I've got
the paraview source in ~/ParaView, and a ~/pv_clone1 folder for the
binaries. In ~/pv_clone1, I ran

ccmake ../ParaView/Examples/CustomApplications/Clone1

but I get the following error:

CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:6 (FIND_PACKAGE):
   Could not find module FindParaView.cmake or a configuration file for
   package ParaView.

   Adjust CMAKE_MODULE_PATH to find FindParaView.cmake or set ParaView_DIR to
   the directory containing a CMake configuration file for ParaView.  The file
   will have one of the following names:

     ParaViewConfig.cmake
     paraview-config.cmake

(plus a few other that stem from this)

I've tried setting ParaView_DIR to ~/ParaView and ~/ParaView/CMake,
but those both resulted in the same error. Setting ParaView_DIR to
~/ParaView/Plugins/SQToolkit (where ParaViewConfig.cmake resides)
causes ccmake to segfault.

What am I doing wrong?

ParaView_DIR must be set to the binary directory for PAraView i.e. the
directory where you built ParaVIew.

Try doing a build of ParaView in some other directory, then point to
that build directory.

I suspect the example's cmake scripts don't like to be built outside
of the paraview source tree anymore and would need slight tweeking to
build without a paraview binary build.

Okay, I'll try that out. That'd make sense, as I've moved my paraview
build tree from where I originally built ParaView.

Hi Hal,

You can import paraview.vtk.io  to access the xml writer.  I agree with
you, it's annoying, paraview's vtk module should be same as the standard
vtk module.  Otherwise, most scripts don't work when transitioning to
pvpython.  I'll go file a bug report.

Thanks!

	import paraview.vtk.io
	writer = paraview.vtk.io.vtkXMLImageDataWriter()

worked perfectly.  No need to install VTK when I already have ParaView!

Could you share your state file and be more precise on which version
of ParaView you try to load it and which error you faced ?

Thanks,

Message-ID: <04C1A58BE022D048A6F1066431FFAADAAFEE@EP1EXMB003.corp.halliburton.com>

Hi
A plugin which works fine on versions 3.10 to 3.12, will not compile on v3.14.

I have the following error in the compilation:

make[2]: *** No rule to make target `/path_to_pv_install_dir/lib/paraview-3.14/CMake/generate_proxydocumentation.cmake', needed by MyReaderPlugin.xml.xml'. Stop.

Does anyone have any suggestions?

Thanks

Ben

Development install isn't being maintained by Kitware anymore. We have
very low priority plans to revive it in future, but no assurances
there.

Message-ID: <F9562F3B302F29479A203FC5AF9E3E05070C18@SERBE4I1.intra.erbe-med.de>

Hi,

I have been using Paraview 3.14 since its release, but then I have switched back to 3.12.0-RC2. The reasons are:

1.      When clicking on "Edit color map", 3.14 crashes from time to time (not always, but enough to be annoying). 3.12.0-RC2 doesn't.
2.      It is not possible any more to select points, then select some more points holding down the Ctrl key.

I have reported those two issues in the bug tracker.

Matthias

Subject: [Paraview] xdmf possible memory leak
Message-ID: <1333557558.12748.68.camel@jason-desktop>

Hello 

I am using the ParaView-3.14.0-Linux-32bit binary with some XDMF
data ... a netcdf4/hdf5 "heavy" data file plus an ascii XDMF xml file
that I generated to go along with it. 

The data are time varying, and when I use "Save Animation", the memory
usage of my machine gradually increases as the process proceeds (please
see attached) until Paraview crashes with the following error:


Qt has caught an exception thrown from an event handler. Throwing
exceptions from an event handler is not supported in Qt. You must
reimplement QApplication::notify() and catch all exceptions there.

terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::bad_alloc'
  what():  std::bad_alloc
Aborted


What steps can I take to troubleshoot this issue further?

Cheers
Jason

Hello,

In the display tab, there is an origin setting that allow to change the 
point of rotation of the transformation values.

But when using a tranform filter (to have properties available in 
animation tracks), there is no more origin settings.

How can I rotate an mesh based on a custom rotation center in animations ??

Thanks

Hi Randy,

it seems that you used our SuperBuild, is that right ?
If so, I think it is just that your proxy might already have unzipped
the apr package which cause the MD5 to fail.
One way to see if you can go further is to remove the MD5 line in the
CMake file.
And re-run cmake/make process...

Seb

Some fixes for ?Edit color map? went in the coming 3.14.1 release, so
you can try it out to see if random crash is still there.

Subject: [Paraview] Plugin selecting points and fitting sphere to them
Message-ID: <83FB51056FB3664CB2A09728F5E9187701A6604B@email.ktk.uni-leipzig.de>

Hi All

 

I would like get access to points of a 3D model selected with the rubber band and fit a sphere to them. So the output of the plugin would be of type polydata. Therefore I would have to derive my filter-class from vtkPolyDataFilter. But now I have no access to the selection. When using a filter derived from vtkPVExtractSelection the selection is already set up but now I have the problem to add a polydata for the output.

 

Any help would be much appreciated.

 

Regards, Peter.

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView Constant Axes
Message-ID: <CADukiX-PZu+fz+5Z5wE1yisPJGG4iqM41A3aeSo4wJyS4dVAUA@mail.gmail.com>

Good Afternoon

I was wondering if someone could provide me information to let me know if
there is a way to set the axes constant.  I open ParaView and load in
mulitple VTK files (named such that they are time step files).  The VTK
files contain unstructured grids.  However, each time step is NOT
guaranteed to have vertices spanning the entire xaxis that I wish to be
constant
( -1 to 1000).  I would also like to make the y axis and zaxis constant.

I know that you can click on the Display tab in the object inspector and
click Show Cube Axes and Edit.  However, I would like for a user to not
have to go through these steps after loading in my files.

Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you

Tricia

Thanks for the reply Seb.  Yes, I'm trying to use the SuperBuild.  I removed the MD5 lines as you suggested and then also had to change the version of APR to be 1.4.6.  The build is proceeding...

Subject: [Paraview] Naming of inputs in ParaView plugins
Message-ID: <CANmPiKDAXGJwfgPdkh5BHJz=NnZhedTwuxO7biX8-W4ThHWaOQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I learned after several hours of tinkering today that in a ParaView
plugin XML description file for a filter that takes one input source,
the "name" attribute of the InputProperty element *must* have the
value "Input". If it does not, then the filter will work as expected,
but it will not appear as a child of its input filter/source in the
pipeline browser. Instead, it appears as a child of the server.

For example, this produces the proper pipeline browser appearance:

      <InputProperty
         name="Input"
         port_index="0"
         command="SetInputConnection">

This, however, will produce make the filter appear to be a child of
the server in the pipeline browser:

      <InputProperty
         name="FirstInput"
         port_index="0"
         command="SetInputConnection">

Note that for filters that take several inputs, you are free to assign
any value to the "name" attribute, as far as I know.

I've noted this requirement in the ParaView wiki page on making
XML_Only plugins:

Cheers,
Cory

Hi.


I'm trying to build ParaView 3.14.0 on clean-installed CentOS 6.2.
I followed those steps on ParaView Wiki:
http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView:Build_And_Install

I already installed Python 2.7.2, Qt-Everywhere-Opensource 4.6.2,
cmake 2.8.2 from sources on /usr/local.
Then I did configure on ccmake, it only said:
> Qt QTWEBKIT library not found.
>
> Qt QTWEBKIT library not found.

What could I do for this problem?
It may be due to Qt's setting, but I'm not familiar with Qt. :(

if your Qt was not built with the web stuff lib then you need to remove all uses of it from paraview. I use the attached patch for pv3.14

You may need to set the Qt web lib to something valid to shut cmake up.

Alternatively, when configuring with ccmake in advanced mode you can 
turn off the variable VTK_QT_USE_WEBKIT.

Hi Peter,

If I understand you correctly, what you can do is to derive the filter
from vtkPolyDataAlgorithm, and set up two inputs for the filter, one
for the model, one for the selection. You can look at
vtkExtractSelectedPolyDataIds to see how to set it up.

Then, on Paraview side, you need to set the model-source as input0 and
its selection as input1 to your filter.

First, create myfilter with the model-source (reader or filter to
output the model),

Then get the selection source, (you may want to do this where you are
handling the selection-finished signal from paraview)

  vtkSMSourceProxy* selectionSource =
vtkSMSourceProxy::SafeDownCast(mymodelSource)->GetSelectionInput(0);

Then,

vtkSMSourceProxy::SafeDownCast(myfilter)->SetSelectionInput(0,
selectionSource, 0);

Thank you for the quick response.  I played around with both the Box and
Axes sources.  My first question is that is it correct that after I add my
vtk files, then add the Box source (adding the properties I wish), I have
to then hit the "Reset" button in the Camera controls toolbar before the
box will move???

I treid to add the Box Source, then hit apply, then run the animation and
the box has not moved until I hit reset.  Am I doing something wrong?

My second question is when I add my vtk files, then add a glyph to the
pipeline (using an arrow as glyph type), the data points become arrows like
I would want.  However, as soon as I move origin, axes, or center of the
camera (using either a Box Source, Axes Source, Clicking the Pick Center
button in the Camera controls toolbar and then hitting reset, or by going
to the display tab and using the Annotation "Show Cube Axes") my glyphs
turn back to just points.  The only way I can get them back is to start the
animation, pause it and then change the glyph type and hit apply????

I have attached 2 of my VTK files.  THe first one in the time sequence and
one other random one so you can see how the points all start at (-1,-1,-1)
but then at different times there are objects "flying" somewhere in the
plane ([0 1000] [0 500] [0 50]).  I can make the axes all constant if that
helps

Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you

Tricia

Hi to all,

I have a raw image for which the acquisition has not been done
following the usual orientation. In other words, the image is not 
orientated
following the usual orthogonal axes, but slightly in diagonal. The size
of the image : 1340*1340*1560, representing 2,8 Go.

Is it possible to modify its orientation and to save it with the 
modified orientation?

Thanks for your help,
Claire Mouton

VTK's support for non axis aligned volumes is limited to the
vtkStructuredGrid class. Like vtkImageData and vtkRectilinearGrid, it
is used to represent topologically regular images and volumes. However
the geometry is unconstrained in this class and you have to supply
coordinates for every point. This implies even greater memory use.

So what I suggest is load in your raw data in ParaView as normal then
apply the python programmable filter or python calculator to:
1) change the type to vtkStructuredGrid
2) compute and populate a buffer with the correct coordinates for each point
3) use vtkStructuredGrid::SetPoints to tell the StructuredGrid to use
that buffer as the data set's geometry

Message-ID: <CADHSJjCk4+jgeNxG8Dm4WJZK0OemhyzaYph2bDXwAYqpurWqOA@mail.gmail.com>

Folks,

ParaView 3.14.1 is now available for download
(http://paraview.org/paraview/resources/software.php).

This is bug fix release that includes fixes for ParaView 3.14.0.
ParaView 3.14.1 clients can be used to connect with servers running
ParaView 3.14.0 and vice-versa. Similarly, plugins built for ParaView
3.14.0 should generally work with ParaView 3.14.1.

The issues that were fixed are as follows:

- 0012924: Paraview 3.12.0 fails to build with zlib 1.2.6, invalid
conversion from 'void*' to 'gzFile'
- 0012956: Auto apply, variables don't show up.
- 0012964: View Layout State issue
- 0012969: pvsc option enumeration issues
- 0012970: No way to use netcdf4 with system netcdf
- 0012981: Bug in panning/scaling of top-right axes in charts
- 0012983: HSCTH files not reading timesteps correctly
- 0012984: cherrypick the fix in VTK of vtkPyramid.cxx compute
gradient into ParaView
- 0012991: Build problem with nmake and windows
- 0012997: protoc generation doesn't work on Windows with nmake builds.
- 0013012: Errors on FindData
- 0013030: EnSight6Reader incorrect "transient single file format" and
"scalar per element"
- 0013033: problems with scalar bar
- 0013048: ContourRepresentation can't override Intialize

Detailed change log can be found at
http://paraview.org/Bug/changelog_page.php?version_id=95.

Thanks for your advices.
I'm still trying to build ParaView on CentOS 6.2.


> JB

I recieved the patch file, but I can't understand the usage....
How to use the patch file?

> Lennart

I couldn't find VTK_QT_USE_WEBKIT flag.
Maybe we couldn't turn off QtWebKit on cmake.


Then I'm also trying to build QtWebKit 2.2.0, but errors occur as below:
> cc1plus: warnings being treated as errors
> ../../../Source/JavaScriptCore/yarr/YarrPattern.cpp: In member function 'void JSC::Yarr::CharacterClassConstructor::putRange(UChar, UChar)':

> ../../../Source/JavaScriptCore/yarr/YarrPattern.cpp:133: error: comparison between signed and unsigned integer expressions
> make[1]: *** [obj/release/YarrPattern.o] Error 1

When I built ParaView 3.12.0 on my Mac (10.7), it was extremely easy.
I didn't prepare QtWebKit module, but the cmake process was finished successfully.

I wonder how everyone build ParaView on Linux distributions?

Since you're building Qt from source, try to reconfigure and build Qt
with WebKit enabled. Your configure command for QT should look
something like follows:

./configure  -webkit -xmlpatterns <any other params>

Then, before Qt starts building, it spits out a block of text saying
what features were enabled/disabled. Pay close attention to that. Post
that piece of test if needed. That should tell you if webkit was
enabled or disabled.

ParaView doesn't currently support not building with WebKit support
(except for using John's patch).

Actually, there is a much easier solution.  As of ParaView 3.14, the
Transform filter works on both vtkImageData and vtkRectilinearGrid.
Simply load your data in ParaView, and apply the Transform filter using
whatever rotations you want.

Hi,

Last year a Google Summer of Code project added some new data types
and utility classes for chemical structure visualization. We plan to
add some new representations to ParaView at some point soon, along
with some experimental work in ParaViewWeb for web visualization using
the ParaView framework.

We are looking at MD, and the best way to support some of those data
structures in VTK and ParaView but there is nothing I can point you to
that can be used right now. What MD file formats are you thinking of,
what type of visualization/analysis are you hoping to do? I think more
will be added, but there is not a specific project that is tasked with
extending ParaView for molecular visualization.

Hope that helps.

Greetings to all,

The project for releasing _unofficial_ ParaView Development installs 
(mostly for Windows) - 
http://code.google.com/p/unofficial-paraview-dev-install/ - has been 
finally updated this week, just in time to be updated within a few hours 
of the official release of ParaView 3.14.1:

  * List of downloads:
    http://code.google.com/p/unofficial-paraview-dev-install/wiki/Downloads
  * List of development notes related to the updates made:
      o Notes for ParaView 3.12.0
        <http://code.google.com/p/unofficial-paraview-dev-install/wiki/Notes3120>

      o Notes for ParaView 3.14.0
        <http://code.google.com/p/unofficial-paraview-dev-install/wiki/Notes3140>

      o Notes for ParaView 3.14.1
        <http://code.google.com/p/unofficial-paraview-dev-install/wiki/Notes3141>

In the notes are described the changes and brief steps for building 
one's own ParaView SuperBuild on Windows. These unofficial releases have 
not been subjected to through testing yet, so if anyone finds problems 
with them, please use our dedicated Issue Tracker for them: 
http://code.google.com/p/unofficial-paraview-dev-install/issues/list

Brief summary of features:

  * 3 types of packages are provided:
      o The modified sources, in both tar.bz2 and 7z formats.
      o Self-extractable packages with headers, cmake files and library
        interfaces, i.e. the necessary development files. These are
        meant for complementing the official releases of ParaView.
      o Self-extractable packages with both the previous development
        files and the working ParaView + Open-MPI binaries.
        FYI: these are using Qt 4.6.3 in ParaView 3.14.*, instead of Qt
        4.6.4; but it should still work, since Qt 4.6.4 should be a bug
        fix release and should be fully compatible symbol-wise...
  * A few options were added to the SuperBuild files:
      o Added "ParaView_INSTALL_DEVELOPMENT" to the main
        "CMakeLists.txt" file, for including the installation of the
        development files when installing ParaView.
      o Added "ParaView_MPI_SUPERBUILD" for choosing to use the system's
        MPI (auto-detect only), instead of the default ones on
        SuperBuild. The usage case scenario for this option is
        documented here:
        http://www.cfd-online.com/Forums/blogs/wyldckat/1203-paraview-3-12-0-superbuild-openfoam.html
  * List of code changes can be seen in the repository:
    http://code.google.com/p/unofficial-paraview-dev-install/source/detail?r=8ca38a1b4809448776414b2ed805604e4f2a5955&repo=paraview3141

These changes aren't complete yet, since:

  * There is still work to be done for automating the
    installation/packaging process.
  * And the Silo project isn't automatically upgraded when using MSVC
    2008 Express... the "vcbuild" application has to be used in an
    automated scenario with 2008 Express and it will probably require a
    somewhat "ugly hack".

Best regards,
Bruno Santos at blueCAPE Lda

PS: I hope this doesn't go "top post"... since a reply to this ANN 
seemed the best place to "advertise" this ;)

Hi Paraview community!
I am trying to develop a paraviewweb application that involves loading of a state file plus the creation of a 'button' to allow data labels to appear on the plot. ?I can load the state file but have no idea how to create the necessary button and functionality. ?I would be?grateful?to anyone kind enough to give me a few pointers. ?Thank you. ?

Message-ID: <CAE_bc5bPyGW-CgcYc_BDWEXWXYKOCfaKCASGSpJrBQkB8qtUBg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

This is what I doing:

1- Load the PVD file (which holds the real time information associated with
each *.vtr file)

<?xml version="1.0"?>
 <VTKFile type="Collection" version="0.1" byte_order="LittleEndian"
compressor="vtkZLibDataCompressor">
   <Collection>
    <DataSet timestep="0.0" group="" part="0" file="vel_vec_0.vtr"/>
    <DataSet timestep="0.2" group="" part="0" file="vel_vec_1.vtr"/>
    <DataSet timestep="0.4" group="" part="0" file="vel_vec_2.vtr"/>
    <DataSet timestep="0.6" group="" part="0" file="vel_vec_3.vtr"/>
    <DataSet timestep="0.8" group="" part="0" file="vel_vec_4.vtr"/>
    <DataSet timestep="1.0" group="" part="0" file="vel_vec_5.vtr"/>
    <DataSet timestep="1.2" group="" part="0" file="vel_vec_6.vtr"/>
    <DataSet timestep="1.4" group="" part="0" file="vel_vec_7.vtr"/>
    <DataSet timestep="1.6" group="" part="0" file="vel_vec_8.vtr"/>
    <DataSet timestep="1.8" group="" part="0" file="vel_vec_9.vtr"/>
    <DataSet timestep="2.0" group="" part="0" file="vel_vec_10.vtr"/>
  </Collection>
</VTKFile>


2- Click on my data and create a "Temporal Cache" with "Cache Size=2".

3- From "Sources", I create a "Line".

4- Click on TemporalCache1 and create a ParticleTracer.
     When the menu pops up, I choose
             a) Input: TemporalCache1
             b) Source: Line1
     Right after I click Ok, this is the message I get (note that this
message is shown even before giving me the chance to change any flags on
the "Properties" section related to the "ParticleTracer1".

/home/utkarsh/Kitware/superbuild/paraview/src/paraview/VTK/Filtering/vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline.cxx,
line 934

vtkPVPostFilterExecutive (0x4db4870): No maximum number of pieces has been
set in the information for output port 0 on algorithm
vtkPVPostFilter(0x4777fd0).


Luckily, Paraview does not crash and I can continue.
After doing some research, I am guessing that this has something to do with
the time conflicts (Pipeline fed into the filter and the animation viewer
time).

*Observation:* Right after I create the ParticleTracer and receive the
error message, the time shown in the animation viewer is increased from
"0.0" to "0.2". Why?

5- Recommended by the powerpoint, I set
         a) Time Step: True (1)
         b) Ignore Pipeline Time: True (1)


6- Now, I use "Animation View" as directed by the same powerpoint to feed
the time into the ParticleTracer1 filter.
         a) Mode: Sequence
         b) Create a keyframe for "ParticleTracer1". Double click on the
bar and set:
                   1: time: 0.2, (interpolation ramp), value: 1
                   2: time: 1.8, (), value: 9

Note: I have varied all the combinations listed above to include/exclude
the last/first steps. No luck! Nothing really happening.

7- Play animation. Result: nothing happening? What is going on?


*Observation: Using Paraview 3.8, I could see the animation without
adjusting any parameters in the "Animation View" menu. Just the annoying
error message was shown. However, I could do the same thing with Paraview
3.14, but it crashes after a few timesteps. *
*
*
Anybody could share some hints on how to go about this?

Thanks,
Mohanad

You can load PDB files directly into Paraview, and it will display 
them.  I've not tried loading sets of PDB files with sequential names 
to view time series dynamics, but you could try that and see if it works.

I forgot to add that there are already several formats as someone else
pointed out - Gaussian cube files, PDB files, more recently CML and a
few others. It really depends on what you are working on.

Hi Jane,

The best thing to do to figure out what is needed in your use case, is
to load your state inside ParaView and do the action that you want to
achieve while the Python trace is recording your changes.

Once you get the trace of your actions you can either convert that
code to JavaScript or write a plugin that execute somehow the same
action in Python as we are using python to write ParaViewWeb plugins.

The access of the trace mechanism is inside the Tools menu of ParaView.

If you need some help to figure out the conversion between Python and
JS, just post the trace on the mailing list.

I'm glad you managed to produce your own first Web application using
ParaViewWeb.

Subject: [Paraview] use the same scalar data to create contour and color the
	surface
Message-ID: <F97FA7A6-00DF-49E8-A60B-D446BE6785E0@indiana.edu>

I have a single volume dataset that has scalar values only on a surface, and zeros everywhere else.  The scalar values represent statistics we have calculated for each point on a surface.  I've been able using the contour filter to create an isosurface from this dataset, but I can't get the surface to display anything other than a single color.  I have tried setting "contour by" to "compute normals" and "compute scalars", and then going to "display" and choosing "color by" scalars.  However, only a single value is allowed.  I have tried unselecting "automatically rescale to fit data range" and then entering my own range, but only my minimum value is accepted (even if I enter a different value for the maximum).  

Perhaps I am using paraview the wrong way, but I have to say, it isn't intuitive.  Is there a way to use the same scalar data (same file) to both: 1) create a surface, and 2) color code the surface based on the same scalar values?

Thanks for any hints or suggestions.

Utkarsh,


I rebuilt Qt with "-webkit" option, but cmake still dumped same errors.
My Qt source is:
ftp://ftp.trolltech.no/qt/source/qt-everywhere-opensource-src-4.7.4.tar.gz

Comparing my Mac (able to build ParaView), I could find:
> QT_QTWEBKIT_INCLUDE_DIR          /opt/local/include/QtWebKit
> QT_QTWEBKIT_LIBRARY_RELEASE      /opt/local/lib/libQtWebKit.dylib

So I tried to find my QtWebKit and libQtWebKit on my CentOS.
I found QtWebKit in:
/usr/local/include/Qt
/usr/local/include/QtWebKit
But no libQtWebkit was found by "find" command.

I rebuild Qt again.... :(

Tom,

An isosurface by definition has the same scalar value everywhere on
the surface, so what you describe happening is exactly what should
happen, unless I misunderstand. You could contour by one scalar field
and color by another scalar field and expect to see different colors,
but if you try to color by the same scalar, you should expect to see
only one color on the surface.

Hi Jane,

keep the prarview mailing list in the loop so anyone could contribute and learn.

In your case that will be pretty simple.
If you use jQuery as JavaScript library that could look like that:

var sourceProxy = paraview.FindSource({name:"Fluid_f2.vtk"});
var representation = paraview.GetDisplayProperties({proxy: sourceProxy});
$('.my-button-class').click(function() {
  if($(this).toggleClass("showLabel").hasClass("showLabel")) {
    representation.setSelectionPointLabelVisibility(1);
  } else {
    representation.setSelectionPointLabelVisibility(0);
  }
});

Or you can create a python script on the server side that can be
called from the JavaScript.
For more details on that you can read the plugin documentation of
ParaViewWeb here.

OK, but is there some way to combine two image files, each with its own scalars, into one image?  What I'm thinking about is reading in 2 copies of the same image, and using the scalars from one to display the contour, and the scalars from the other to display the colors?  I tried doing this, but I can't get it to work. I loaded one as the contour, and colored it one color only (white).  I then added the copy, an tried to view it as a volume.  It let me change the color map parameters, but it seems to display the color UNDERNEATH the first one (that has the contour.  I'm sure there must be a way to do this, but how?

Perhaps there is a way to add 2 scalar fields to one image? Maybe image calculator could do this??

Tom,

You can load your two images and, assuming they are the same size, use
the Append Attributes filter to combine them. However, chances are
good that the scalars in your image data will have the same name,
meaning that Append attributes will grab only the scalar values from
one of the images. To get around this limitation, you can "rename" the
scalar field in one image by using a Calculator filter on it and
setting the "Result Array Name" to something else. Your pipeline will
look like this *before* applying the Append Attributes filter:

Image1
---|
   Calculator1
Image2

To apply the Append Attributes filter, select the Calculator1 filter
and Image2. Use Ctrl-click on Windows to select more than one object
in the pipeline browser. Then select Append Attributes from the
Filters menu under the Alphabetical submenu.

Now you should have two scalar fields in an image data. You can use
one to do the contouring and the other to do the pseudo-coloring.

I've attached a state file with two Wavelet sources in place of image
inputs. It illustrates what I've described here.

Hope that helps,
Cory

Hi Seb,
Thank you for your help. ?However, your code appears to only toggle 'SelectionPointLabelVisibility' on/off. ?What I really need is the equivalent of 'select points on' button as on the GUI that will enable me to interactively select an area on the plot to display labels on. ?I can do this easily interactively, but the python trace appears not to record all of the clicks. ?There is something I'm missing...

Frustrated... :(

Jane.

Hi Jane,

keep the prarview mailing list in the loop so anyone could contribute and learn.

In your case that will be pretty simple.
If you use jQuery as JavaScript library that could look like that:

var sourceProxy = paraview.FindSource({name:"Fluid_f2.vtk"});
var representation = paraview.GetDisplayProperties({proxy: sourceProxy});
$('.my-button-class').click(function() {
? if($(this).toggleClass("showLabel").hasClass("showLabel")) {
? ? representation.setSelectionPointLabelVisibility(1);
? } else {
? ? representation.setSelectionPointLabelVisibility(0);
? }
});

Or you can create a python script on the server side that can be
called from the JavaScript.
For more details on that you can read the plugin documentation of
ParaViewWeb here.

Ok, I miss understood your goal.

Then, the missing part should be something like that.

var view = paraview.GetRenderView(); // this is optional if you
already have a reference to the view...
view.setInteractionMode(2);

Although, I've quickly tried it online with firebug and I did not
manage to see the selection. I'm wondering if we are both missing
something here... Like the creation of a selection proxy that is
created to get the selected screen area and convert it to a set of
cellId...

Utkarsh might have a better insight on that selection part.

Seb

PS: Here is the mapping based on the string values

file: ParaView-SRC/ParaViewCore/ServerImplementation/Resources/views_and_representations.xml

<IntVectorProperty name="InteractionMode"
       command="SetInteractionMode"
       number_of_elements="1"
       default_values="0">
       <EnumerationDomain name="enum">
         <Entry text="3D" value="0" />
         <Entry text="2D" value="1" />
         <Entry text="Selection" value="2" />

Thanks Cory,

The file you sent won't open in my Paraview. It does not recognize the extension (?).  

I followed what you suggested, however:

1) Loaded the first file and selected "apply".  This file has only binary scalars (0=background, 1=surface)
2) Selected calculator and created a function that consisted of: "scalars*1", to be renamed "surface location"; pressed "apply" again
3) Loaded the second file and selected "apply"  This file has float scalar values ranging from 0 to 10.7
4) control-selected both the calculator and second file, and then selected "Append Attributes"; and pressed "apply" again.  This resulted in 3 new items in the pipeline, all called AppendAttributes1.  The one at the bottom had a box icon (the other two had only arrows).  

When I click on the bottom AppendAttributes1 file and look at the information tab, it says it has 2 data arrays.  One is a double called "surface location" (matching what I thought I created in step 2 above), and has value range of 0 to 1 (which is correct).  However, the other one, which I assume is the one from the file loaded in step 3 above, now has a range of only 0 to 1 also (not 0 to 10.7, like it should).  So either it is doing something odd (like rescaling data??) or it got that data elsewhere?  Why is it doing this?

If I then compute a contour based on the "surface location" array in AppendAttributes1, I get the surface I expect to see.

But the other array data is not any good (it isn't 0 to 10.7 anymore).  Even if it was, what exactly would I do then to color the surface with this other array?  Is that done with another filter?  Or is it done in the contour image?

Thanks for any further help!

-Tom

Subject: [Paraview] Problem with Temporal Cache
Message-ID: <CAE_bc5YU_E-WJcJGFLbK_cBuNYS2jeM_vqCHkqQtU-6Vj_abiw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am doing a simple experiment.
I load a *.PVD file (time aware) which looks like this:


<?xml version="1.0"?>
 <VTKFile type="Collection" version="0.1" byte_order="LittleEndian"
compressor="vtkZLibDataCompressor">
   <Collection>
    <DataSet timestep="0.0" group="" part="0" file="vel_vec_0.vtr"/>
    <DataSet timestep="0.2" group="" part="0" file="vel_vec_1.vtr"/>
    <DataSet timestep="0.4" group="" part="0" file="vel_vec_2.vtr"/>
    <DataSet timestep="0.6" group="" part="0" file="vel_vec_3.vtr"/>
    <DataSet timestep="0.8" group="" part="0" file="vel_vec_4.vtr"/>
    <DataSet timestep="1.0" group="" part="0" file="vel_vec_5.vtr"/>
    <DataSet timestep="1.2" group="" part="0" file="vel_vec_6.vtr"/>
    <DataSet timestep="1.4" group="" part="0" file="vel_vec_7.vtr"/>
    <DataSet timestep="1.6" group="" part="0" file="vel_vec_8.vtr"/>
    <DataSet timestep="1.8" group="" part="0" file="vel_vec_9.vtr"/>
    <DataSet timestep="2.0" group="" part="0" file="vel_vec_10.vtr"/>
  </Collection>
</VTKFile>

Then, I apply a Temporal Cache [Cache size = 2] (or similarily Temporal
Interpolator [Discrete Timestep Interval=0.1]) to the loaded dataset.

Then, I create a simple "Slice" filter on my dataset, as soon as I play
animation, Paraview gives this Error message or sometimes crashes. (PV
3.14, on Ubuntu).

  ERROR: In
/home/utkarsh/Kitware/superbuild/paraview/src/paraview/VTK/Filtering/vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline.cxx,
line 934

vtkPVPostFilterExecutive (0x3035620): No maximum number of pieces has been
set in the information for output port 0 on algorithm
vtkPVPostFilter(0x3347630).


What is it that I am doing wrong?


Cheers.

Mohamad

That's odd. Did you load it through the File -> Load State menu item?
I didn't mention that's what you needed to do to load that file, but
in any case, it sounds like you were able to apply my suggestion,
albeit not with the outcome I had hoped.

That is strange. As far as I know, there should be no rescaling or
even any recasting performed on the inputs to the Append Attributes
filter. At least I can't think of a reason there would need to be;
ParaView (actually, the VTK library underneath ParaView) supports
images with scalar fields with different component types. One thing to
try would be to put a calculator filter on your second image and
creating an Append Attributes filter on the outputs of both
calculators. The output from the calculator filters consists of double
arrays, so if the Append Attributes filter has a problem with
different array types, then putting both your images through a
calculator filter should fix that. If you are able to post example
data, I could give it a try and see what is going on.

Once you've created the contour, you can select it in the pipeline
browser (if it is not already selected), click on the Display tab,
find the Color panel, and choose the scalar field by which you want to
color the surface from the "Color by" menu.

Thanks Cory,

I did not know about Load State!  My bad?  I was indeed able to load it.

I still have problems with the data range being truncated, even if I do the calculator step on both files.  For example, on your Wavelet1 and Wavelet2 files, the data ranges are: 37.3531 to 276.829.

This stays the same for the calculator step (highlighting Calculator1 and looking at the Information Tab), as well as the AppendAttributes step (again, as listed in the Information tab).

However, when I do contour, and create the contour (pressing apply), then go to the Information tab, the data range is now 157.091 to 157.091. 

Thus, the range is lost, and the color coding is not what I'd want.  Is this what you also get on your machine?

I've discovered that it has something to do with the Isosurfaces value ranges.  If I leave the default value there (which for your data is 157.091), then the range in the other scalar is truncated to exactly this value: 157.091 (i.e., no range).  But if I "delete all" and then "New range" (and accept the 10 default values it lists), then the range of the remaining scalars extends at least to the next-to-last values on each end of the range.

This makes absolutely no sense to me, but there may be a reason for it?  I don't have enough knowledge of Paraview to know if this is a bug or if it is supposed to do this for some reason.

In any case, for my data, I got it to work by using a binary image of my surface (a brain endocast) and then AppendAttributes this to the stat data file.  For the binary image, I get the full range of stat values if I set the Isosurfaces range value to 1.  

It works, but I don't know why.  

In any case, thank you very much for helping me with this!!

I'd attach a copy of the file if you want to take a look, but it is 52 MB. I can post it if you are interested, but I seem to get the same odd behavior with your data too.

-Tom

Hello,

is there an option to view slices in a 2D view? I am not able to find any.
If not, are there any plans to integrate this? I think it would be a 
great feature...

Hi,
I am trying to plot a vector field and paraview either gives you plots for
each of its components or its total magnitude. Is there any way i could
have the 3 components listed in the vtk file and get it to plot out the
vector contour. Iam not able to get the negative values for the field if I
take only the magnitude. I have read a few posts on this issue and haven't
found any method to deal with this. Kindly help.

This is because I used the default settings for both Wavelet sources,
so they were the same data. Hence, the data range on the contour of
*both* scalars would be the same as the isovalue. If you were to
change one of the settings on the Wavelet source to which you are
*not* applying the contour filter, you should see a larger range of
data values in the information tab for the contour.

My guess is that your stats are computed only inside the binary
segmentation. Contour algorithms such as marching cubes typically
determine where to place vertices on the generated contour by assuming
linear elements in a grid. The result is that when your isovalue is
set to 1, then you get the surface of your segmentation, and the
scalar values interpolated on the contour from your stats scalar field
basically aren't interpolated.When your isovalue is set to 0, the
contour is just about one voxel larger than the boundary between the
inside and the outside of your segmentation. If you don't have any
stats values at the background of your segmentation (or they are
zero), then you shouldn't see anything meaningful in the stats scalar
field computed for the contour. Does that make sense?

In any case, I'm glad you got it to work.

On OS X 10.6.8 with Xcode 3.x I use the following to build from source:

./configure -nomake demos -nomake examples -debug-and-release -shared -fast -exceptions -stl -no-qt3support -cocoa -arch x86 -arch x86_64 -arch ppc -sdk /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.5.sdk -largefile -prefix /Users/Shared/Toolkits/Qt-4.7.4-Cocoa

And this works without issues.

Message-ID: <83FB51056FB3664CB2A09728F5E9187701A660C6@email.ktk.uni-leipzig.de>

Hi All

 

I would like to implement a polydataalgorithm filter which takes a
polydata as input (a cone), does some calculations and produces a sphere
as output of the plugin algorithm. Unfortunately, instantiation of the
sphere seems to be of a problem, as the output remains empty. 

 

This is what I am doing:

 

int vtkTestSphere::RequestData(vtkInformation *request,
vtkInformationVector **inputVector, vtkInformationVector *outputVector)

{

   vtkSmartPointer<vtkSphereSource> sphere =
vtkSmartPointer<vtkSphereSource>::New();

   sphere->SetRadius(50);

   this->GetOutput()->DeepCopy(sphere->GetOutput());

   

  

  return 1;

}

 

 

Any help would me much appreciated!

 

Regards, Peter.

If I understand correctly what you want, you can use the spreadsheet view
to look at the vector component values.  If you want to contour the sum of
the vector components, use the calculator filter to do the sum and then you
can contour a scalar value.

Hello,

So I am trying to figure out how to add an output port to my Reader, but I am having difficulty.

I am trying to create the new output as outlined in the email below, but when I get to the point of adding the column to the table, ParaView segfaults.

Having looked through other emails on the list, it looks like the output ports need to be configured somehow, but I am not sure how to do that.

My reader creates a vtkStructuredGrid for the data, and I need to add the vtkTable for the meta-data? how do I configure the reader for these two outputs?


Currently, my getInformation (beginning) looks like this:
------------


  vtkInformation *outInfo = outputVector->GetInformationObject(0);

  vtkStructuredGrid *output = vtkStructuredGrid::SafeDownCast(

        outInfo->Get(vtkDataObject::DATA_OBJECT()));

  //TODO: Add Meta Data here first

  //      Use VTK Table output Port

  // Following is from discussion on ParaView Mailing List

  //-----------------------------------------------------------

  //  315   vtkInformation *outInfo;

  //  316   vtkTable *output;

  //  317   vtkStringArray *data;

  //  318

  //  319   // output port 1 -> bw data

  //  320   outInfo=outputVector->GetInformationObject(0);

  //  321   output

  //  322     = dynamic_cast<vtkTable*>(outInfo->Get(vtkDataObject::DATA_OBJECT()));

  //  323   data=vtkStringArray::New();

  //  324   data->SetName("BW Data");

  //  325   data->SetNumberOfComponents(1);

  //  326   data->InsertNextValue(bwData.c_str());

  //  327   output->AddColumn(data);

  //  328   data->Delete();

  //----------------------------------------------------------

  vtkTable *MetaDataOutput;

  vtkStringArray *MetaString;

  //output port for table data

MetaDataOutput = dynamic_cast<vtkTable*>(outInfo->Get(vtkDataObject::DATA_OBJECT()));

MetaString = vtkStringArray::New();

MetaString->SetName("Meta Data");

MetaString->InsertNextValue("This is a Test");

MetaString->InsertNextValue("This is Another Test");

//VVVVVVVVV This is making me crash! VVVVVVVVVVVV//

//----- Need another output port! How? -------//

MetaDataOutput->AddColumn(MetaString);

MetaString->Delete();

//structured grid below here....

  vtkStructuredGrid *structOutput = vtkStructuredGrid::SafeDownCast(output);


--------------

The reader segfaults on MetaDataOutput->AddColumn(MetaString);

If someone could point me in the correct direction (or simply tell me how stupid I am being!, and then point in the correct direction!) I would be very grateful!  I am sure I have a basic misunderstanding of what is supposed to be happening here!

Subject: Re: [Paraview] Question on Information Objects

hi, information keys are more for passing info between filters through the pipeline. if all you want is to display a string, you could make a second output port to your reader that produces a vtkTable and populate it with the string. This could be displayed in the pv ui. here's a quick example of what you'd do in your request data:


315   vtkInformation *outInfo;
316   vtkTable *output;
317   vtkStringArray *data;
318
319   // output port 1 -> bw data
320   outInfo=outputVector->GetInformationObject(0);
321   output
322     = dynamic_cast<vtkTable*>(outInfo->Get(vtkDataObject::DATA_OBJECT()));
323   data=vtkStringArray::New();
324   data->SetName("BW Data");
325   data->SetNumberOfComponents(1);
326   data->InsertNextValue(bwData.c_str());
327   output->AddColumn(data);
328   data->Delete();

Hello,

I am trying to get meta-data information from a file into ParaView.  I have successfully built the information key-value pairs in the information object in my reader, but I am uncertain how to get the data out on the ParaView side of things.

Example:

I want to get the Calendar date meta-data from my model file.  I added Key to the information object to the results info object.

I set keys as follows:


  request->AppendUnique(vtkExecutive::KEYS_TO_COPY(), vtkENLILMetaDataKeys::REFDATE_CAL());


I have a function to add the value to the key like such:


void vtkENLILMetaDataKeys::populate_meta_data(vtkInformation* request, vtkInformationStringKey *key, char* value)

{

  request->Set(key, value);

}


I then add the values to the keys as follows:


  vtkENLILMetaDataKeys::populate_meta_data(outInfo, vtkENLILMetaDataKeys::REFDATE_CAL(), temp);

After I do this, I can successfully pull the placed data from the information object from within the reader.

What I cannot figure out is how to access this object from within Paraview.

My goal is to be able to include the calendar date (as text) in the render view.

Can someone guide me in the correct direction on how to do this?  I am looking for possibly a python way of getting at this data.

Thanks,

Josh

Hi Joshua,

In your constructor you'd need to call

    this->SetNumberOfInputPorts(2);

You'd need to override

    FillInputPortInformation(int port, vtkInformation *info)

implement a switch on port number and do something like:

  288   switch (port)
  289     {
  290     // Vector feild data
  291     case 0:
  292       info->Set(vtkAlgorithm::INPUT_REQUIRED_DATA_TYPE(), 
"vtkUnstructuredGrid");
  293       break;
  294     // Seed points
  295     case 1:
  296       info->Set(vtkAlgorithm::INPUT_REQUIRED_DATA_TYPE(), "vtkTable");
  297       break;
  398     }

in request data you have to grab the table from the second information 
object.

Hope this helps
Burlen

Hi Joshua,

In your constructor you'd need to call
this->SetNumberOfInputPorts(2);
You'd need to override
FillInputPortInformation(int port, vtkInformation *info)
implement a switch on port number and do something like:

 288   switch (port)
 289     {
 290     // Vector feild data
 291     case 0:
 292       info->Set(vtkAlgorithm::INPUT_REQUIRED_DATA_TYPE(), "vtkUnstructuredGrid");
 293       break;
 294     // Seed points
 295     case 1:
 296       info->Set(vtkAlgorithm::INPUT_REQUIRED_DATA_TYPE(), "vtkTable");
 297       break;
 398     }

in request data you have to grab the table from the second information object.

Hope this helps
Burlen

Hello,

So I am trying to figure out how to add an output port to my Reader, but I am having difficulty.

I am trying to create the new output as outlined in the email below, but when I get to the point of adding the column to the table, ParaView segfaults.

Having looked through other emails on the list, it looks like the output ports need to be configured somehow, but I am not sure how to do that.

My reader creates a vtkStructuredGrid for the data, and I need to add the vtkTable for the meta-data? how do I configure the reader for these two outputs?


Currently, my getInformation (beginning) looks like this:
------------


  vtkInformation *outInfo = outputVector->GetInformationObject(0);

  vtkStructuredGrid *output = vtkStructuredGrid::SafeDownCast(

        outInfo->Get(vtkDataObject::DATA_OBJECT()));

  //TODO: Add Meta Data here first

  //      Use VTK Table output Port

  // Following is from discussion on ParaView Mailing List


  //-----------------------------------------------------------

  //  315   vtkInformation *outInfo;

  //  316   vtkTable *output;

  //  317   vtkStringArray *data;

  //  318

  //  319   // output port 1 -> bw data

  //  320   outInfo=outputVector->GetInformationObject(0);

  //  321   output

  //  322     = dynamic_cast<vtkTable*>(outInfo->Get(vtkDataObject::DATA_OBJECT()));

  //  323   data=vtkStringArray::New();

  //  324   data->SetName("BW Data");

  //  325   data->SetNumberOfComponents(1);

  //  326   data->InsertNextValue(bwData.c_str());

  //  327   output->AddColumn(data);

  //  328   data->Delete();

  //----------------------------------------------------------

  vtkTable *MetaDataOutput;

  vtkStringArray *MetaString;

  //output port for table data

MetaDataOutput = dynamic_cast<vtkTable*>(outInfo->Get(vtkDataObject::DATA_OBJECT()));

MetaString = vtkStringArray::New();

MetaString->SetName("Meta Data");

MetaString->InsertNextValue("This is a Test");

MetaString->InsertNextValue("This is Another Test");

//VVVVVVVVV This is making me crash! VVVVVVVVVVVV//

//----- Need another output port! How? -------//

MetaDataOutput->AddColumn(MetaString);

MetaString->Delete();

//structured grid below here....

  vtkStructuredGrid *structOutput = vtkStructuredGrid::SafeDownCast(output);

--------------

The reader segfaults on MetaDataOutput->AddColumn(MetaString);

If someone could point me in the correct direction (or simply tell me how stupid I am being!, and then point in the correct direction!) I would be very grateful!  I am sure I have a basic misunderstanding of what is supposed to be happening here!

hi, information keys are more for passing info between filters through the pipeline. if all you want is to display a string, you could make a second output port to your reader that produces a vtkTable and populate it with the string. This could be displayed in the pv ui. here's a quick example of what you'd do in your request data:


315   vtkInformation *outInfo;
316   vtkTable *output;
317   vtkStringArray *data;
318
319   // output port 1 -> bw data
320   outInfo=outputVector->GetInformationObject(0);
321   output
322     = dynamic_cast<vtkTable*>(outInfo->Get(vtkDataObject::DATA_OBJECT()));
323   data=vtkStringArray::New();
324   data->SetName("BW Data");
325   data->SetNumberOfComponents(1);
326   data->InsertNextValue(bwData.c_str());
327   output->AddColumn(data);
328   data->Delete();

Hello,

I am trying to get meta-data information from a file into ParaView.  I have successfully built the information key-value pairs in the information object in my reader, but I am uncertain how to get the data out on the ParaView side of things.

Example:

I want to get the Calendar date meta-data from my model file.  I added Key to the information object to the results info object.

I set keys as follows:


  request->AppendUnique(vtkExecutive::KEYS_TO_COPY(), vtkENLILMetaDataKeys::REFDATE_CAL());


I have a function to add the value to the key like such:


void vtkENLILMetaDataKeys::populate_meta_data(vtkInformation* request, vtkInformationStringKey *key, char* value)

{

  request->Set(key, value);

}


I then add the values to the keys as follows:


  vtkENLILMetaDataKeys::populate_meta_data(outInfo, vtkENLILMetaDataKeys::REFDATE_CAL(), temp);

After I do this, I can successfully pull the placed data from the information object from within the reader.

What I cannot figure out is how to access this object from within Paraview.

My goal is to be able to include the calendar date (as text) in the render view.

Can someone guide me in the correct direction on how to do this?  I am looking for possibly a python way of getting at this data.

Thanks,

Josh

Subject: [Paraview] Python Script for Marking Points
Message-ID: <CAKsPKwn54dh4B5P+9NgNjd-ejH-muOFBsKwWcuGPXs-472DK_Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm a complete newbie when it comes to python scripting and need a little
bit of help. I'm trying to debug a parallel code using paraview. I have
an unstructured grid that I save as a legacy vtk file. In it, I save the
grid information and also the processor id of each point. What I want to
do, is to visually mark the ghost points on the grid for each processor. My
solution is simple right now, I open up the spreadsheet and select the
ghost points and they are automatically marked up on the wireframe view of
the grid.

Is there any way to automate this using a python script (or any other way)?
I can for example save the ghost point indecies in a file.

Thanks

Hi Burlen,

I think I am getting there, but I am having the following problem now..

The following snippet from my RequestData is causing a segfault?


 vtkInformation *outInfo2 = outputVector->GetInformationObject(1);

 vtkTable *MetaDataOutput = vtkTable::SafeDownCast(outInfo2->Get(vtkDataObject::DATA_OBJECT()));

Am I grabbing the information object incorrectly, or do I need to override another method? Do I need to do something with RequestDataObject()?

If you can help, that would be great!

Joshua,

There was mistake in my previous post, you should override 
FillOutputInformation and set info->Set(vtkDataObject::DATA_TYPE_NAME(), 
"vtkTable");

Sorry about that.

Burlen,

Hopefully this will be the last question for a while? :)

I have FillOutputInformation as follows:


int vtkENLILReader::FillOutputPortInformation(int port, vtkInformation *info)

{

  switch(port)

    {

    case 0:

      info->Set(vtkDataObject::DATA_TYPE_NAME(), "vtkStructuredGrid");

      break;

    case 1:

      info->Set(vtkDataObject::DATA_TYPE_NAME(), "vtkTable");

      break;

    }

}

But when I load the plugin and open a file, I get the following Error:

ERROR: In /Users/jjm390/LASP/release/mpi_config/ParaView-3.12.0/VTK/Filtering/vtkDemandDrivenPipeline.cxx, line 689
vtkPVCompositeDataPipeline (0x1198155f0): Algorithm vtkENLILReader(0x119820d80) did not create output for port 0 when asked by REQUEST_DATA_OBJECT and does not specify any DATA_TYPE_NAME.

Any thoughts?

Thanks,
Josh

Joshua,

There was mistake in my previous post, you should override FillOutputInformation and set info->Set(vtkDataObject::DATA_TYPE_NAME(), "vtkTable");

Sorry about that.

Hi Burlen,

I think I am getting there, but I am having the following problem now..

The following snippet from my RequestData is causing a segfault?


 vtkInformation *outInfo2 = outputVector->GetInformationObject(1);

 vtkTable *MetaDataOutput = vtkTable::SafeDownCast(outInfo2->Get(vtkDataObject::DATA_OBJECT()));

Am I grabbing the information object incorrectly, or do I need to override another method? Do I need to do something with RequestDataObject()?

If you can help, that would be great!

Hi Joshua,

In your constructor you'd need to call
this->SetNumberOfInputPorts(2);
You'd need to override
FillInputPortInformation(int port, vtkInformation *info)
implement a switch on port number and do something like:

 288   switch (port)
 289     {
 290     // Vector feild data
 291     case 0:
 292       info->Set(vtkAlgorithm::INPUT_REQUIRED_DATA_TYPE(), "vtkUnstructuredGrid");
 293       break;
 294     // Seed points
 295     case 1:
 296       info->Set(vtkAlgorithm::INPUT_REQUIRED_DATA_TYPE(), "vtkTable");
 297       break;
 398     }

in request data you have to grab the table from the second information object.

Hope this helps
Burlen

Hello,

So I am trying to figure out how to add an output port to my Reader, but I am having difficulty.

I am trying to create the new output as outlined in the email below, but when I get to the point of adding the column to the table, ParaView segfaults.

Having looked through other emails on the list, it looks like the output ports need to be configured somehow, but I am not sure how to do that.

My reader creates a vtkStructuredGrid for the data, and I need to add the vtkTable for the meta-data? how do I configure the reader for these two outputs?


Currently, my getInformation (beginning) looks like this:
------------


  vtkInformation *outInfo = outputVector->GetInformationObject(0);

  vtkStructuredGrid *output = vtkStructuredGrid::SafeDownCast(

        outInfo->Get(vtkDataObject::DATA_OBJECT()));

  //TODO: Add Meta Data here first

  //      Use VTK Table output Port

  // Following is from discussion on ParaView Mailing List

  //-----------------------------------------------------------

  //  315   vtkInformation *outInfo;

  //  316   vtkTable *output;

  //  317   vtkStringArray *data;

  //  318

  //  319   // output port 1 -> bw data

  //  320   outInfo=outputVector->GetInformationObject(0);

  //  321   output

  //  322     = dynamic_cast<vtkTable*>(outInfo->Get(vtkDataObject::DATA_OBJECT()));

  //  323   data=vtkStringArray::New();

  //  324   data->SetName("BW Data");

  //  325   data->SetNumberOfComponents(1);

  //  326   data->InsertNextValue(bwData.c_str());

  //  327   output->AddColumn(data);

  //  328   data->Delete();

  //----------------------------------------------------------

  vtkTable *MetaDataOutput;

  vtkStringArray *MetaString;

  //output port for table data

MetaDataOutput = dynamic_cast<vtkTable*>(outInfo->Get(vtkDataObject::DATA_OBJECT()));

MetaString = vtkStringArray::New();

MetaString->SetName("Meta Data");

MetaString->InsertNextValue("This is a Test");

MetaString->InsertNextValue("This is Another Test");

//VVVVVVVVV This is making me crash! VVVVVVVVVVVV//

//----- Need another output port! How? -------//

MetaDataOutput->AddColumn(MetaString);

MetaString->Delete();

//structured grid below here....

  vtkStructuredGrid *structOutput = vtkStructuredGrid::SafeDownCast(output);

--------------

The reader segfaults on MetaDataOutput->AddColumn(MetaString);

If someone could point me in the correct direction (or simply tell me how stupid I am being!, and then point in the correct direction!) I would be very grateful!  I am sure I have a basic misunderstanding of what is supposed to be happening here!

Subject: Re: [Paraview] Question on Information Objects

hi, information keys are more for passing info between filters through the pipeline. if all you want is to display a string, you could make a second output port to your reader that produces a vtkTable and populate it with the string. This could be displayed in the pv ui. here's a quick example of what you'd do in your request data:


315   vtkInformation *outInfo;
316   vtkTable *output;
317   vtkStringArray *data;
318
319   // output port 1 -> bw data
320   outInfo=outputVector->GetInformationObject(0);
321   output
322     = dynamic_cast<vtkTable*>(outInfo->Get(vtkDataObject::DATA_OBJECT()));
323   data=vtkStringArray::New();
324   data->SetName("BW Data");
325   data->SetNumberOfComponents(1);
326   data->InsertNextValue(bwData.c_str());
327   output->AddColumn(data);
328   data->Delete();

Hello,

I am trying to get meta-data information from a file into ParaView.  I have successfully built the information key-value pairs in the information object in my reader, but I am uncertain how to get the data out on the ParaView side of things.

Example:

I want to get the Calendar date meta-data from my model file.  I added Key to the information object to the results info object.

I set keys as follows:


  request->AppendUnique(vtkExecutive::KEYS_TO_COPY(), vtkENLILMetaDataKeys::REFDATE_CAL());


I have a function to add the value to the key like such:


void vtkENLILMetaDataKeys::populate_meta_data(vtkInformation* request, vtkInformationStringKey *key, char* value)

{

  request->Set(key, value);

}


I then add the values to the keys as follows:


  vtkENLILMetaDataKeys::populate_meta_data(outInfo, vtkENLILMetaDataKeys::REFDATE_CAL(), temp);

After I do this, I can successfully pull the placed data from the information object from within the reader.

What I cannot figure out is how to access this object from within Paraview.

My goal is to be able to include the calendar date (as text) in the render view.

Can someone guide me in the correct direction on how to do this?  I am looking for possibly a python way of getting at this data.

Thanks,

Josh

Looks OK. did you return a value ? if not you should return 1. You don't 
need to override RequestDataObject.

Looks OK. did you return a value ? if not you should return 1. You don't need to override RequestDataObject.

Burlen,

Hopefully this will be the last question for a while? :)

I have FillOutputInformation as follows:


int vtkENLILReader::FillOutputPortInformation(int port, vtkInformation *info)

{

  switch(port)

    {

    case 0:

      info->Set(vtkDataObject::DATA_TYPE_NAME(), "vtkStructuredGrid");

      break;

    case 1:

      info->Set(vtkDataObject::DATA_TYPE_NAME(), "vtkTable");

      break;

    }

}

But when I load the plugin and open a file, I get the following Error:

ERROR: In /Users/jjm390/LASP/release/mpi_config/ParaView-3.12.0/VTK/Filtering/vtkDemandDrivenPipeline.cxx, line 689

Any thoughts?

Joshua,

There was mistake in my previous post, you should override FillOutputInformation and set info->Set(vtkDataObject::DATA_TYPE_NAME(), "vtkTable");

Sorry about that.

Hi Burlen,

I think I am getting there, but I am having the following problem now..

The following snippet from my RequestData is causing a segfault?


 vtkInformation *outInfo2 = outputVector->GetInformationObject(1);

 vtkTable *MetaDataOutput = vtkTable::SafeDownCast(outInfo2->Get(vtkDataObject::DATA_OBJECT()));

Am I grabbing the information object incorrectly, or do I need to override another method? Do I need to do something with RequestDataObject()?

If you can help, that would be great!

Hi Joshua,

In your constructor you'd need to call
this->SetNumberOfInputPorts(2);
You'd need to override
FillInputPortInformation(int port, vtkInformation *info)
implement a switch on port number and do something like:

 288   switch (port)
 289     {
 290     // Vector feild data
 291     case 0:
 292       info->Set(vtkAlgorithm::INPUT_REQUIRED_DATA_TYPE(), "vtkUnstructuredGrid");
 293       break;
 294     // Seed points
 295     case 1:
 296       info->Set(vtkAlgorithm::INPUT_REQUIRED_DATA_TYPE(), "vtkTable");
 297       break;
 398     }

in request data you have to grab the table from the second information object.

Hope this helps
Burlen

Hello,

So I am trying to figure out how to add an output port to my Reader, but I am having difficulty.

I am trying to create the new output as outlined in the email below, but when I get to the point of adding the column to the table, ParaView segfaults.

Having looked through other emails on the list, it looks like the output ports need to be configured somehow, but I am not sure how to do that.

My reader creates a vtkStructuredGrid for the data, and I need to add the vtkTable for the meta-data? how do I configure the reader for these two outputs?


Currently, my getInformation (beginning) looks like this:
------------


  vtkInformation *outInfo = outputVector->GetInformationObject(0);

  vtkStructuredGrid *output = vtkStructuredGrid::SafeDownCast(

        outInfo->Get(vtkDataObject::DATA_OBJECT()));

  //TODO: Add Meta Data here first

  //      Use VTK Table output Port

  // Following is from discussion on ParaView Mailing List

  //-----------------------------------------------------------



  //  315   vtkInformation *outInfo;



  //  316   vtkTable *output;



  //  317   vtkStringArray *data;



  //  318



  //  319   // output port 1 -> bw data



  //  320   outInfo=outputVector->GetInformationObject(0);



  //  321   output



  //  322     = dynamic_cast<vtkTable*>(outInfo->Get(vtkDataObject::DATA_OBJECT()));



  //  323   data=vtkStringArray::New();



  //  324   data->SetName("BW Data");



  //  325   data->SetNumberOfComponents(1);



  //  326   data->InsertNextValue(bwData.c_str());



  //  327   output->AddColumn(data);



  //  328   data->Delete();



  //----------------------------------------------------------



  vtkTable *MetaDataOutput;



  vtkStringArray *MetaString;



  //output port for table data



MetaDataOutput = dynamic_cast<vtkTable*>(outInfo->Get(vtkDataObject::DATA_OBJECT()));



MetaString = vtkStringArray::New();



MetaString->SetName("Meta Data");



MetaString->InsertNextValue("This is a Test");



MetaString->InsertNextValue("This is Another Test");



//VVVVVVVVV This is making me crash! VVVVVVVVVVVV//



//----- Need another output port! How? -------//



MetaDataOutput->AddColumn(MetaString);



MetaString->Delete();



//structured grid below here....



  vtkStructuredGrid *structOutput = vtkStructuredGrid::SafeDownCast(output);





--------------

The reader segfaults on MetaDataOutput->AddColumn(MetaString);

If someone could point me in the correct direction (or simply tell me how stupid I am being!, and then point in the correct direction!) I would be very grateful!  I am sure I have a basic misunderstanding of what is supposed to be happening here!

Subject: Re: [Paraview] Question on Information Objects

hi, information keys are more for passing info between filters through the pipeline. if all you want is to display a string, you could make a second output port to your reader that produces a vtkTable and populate it with the string. This could be displayed in the pv ui. here's a quick example of what you'd do in your request data:


315   vtkInformation *outInfo;
316   vtkTable *output;
317   vtkStringArray *data;
318
319   // output port 1 -> bw data
320   outInfo=outputVector->GetInformationObject(0);
321   output
322     = dynamic_cast<vtkTable*>(outInfo->Get(vtkDataObject::DATA_OBJECT()));
323   data=vtkStringArray::New();
324   data->SetName("BW Data");
325   data->SetNumberOfComponents(1);
326   data->InsertNextValue(bwData.c_str());
327   output->AddColumn(data);
328   data->Delete();

Hello,

I am trying to get meta-data information from a file into ParaView.  I have successfully built the information key-value pairs in the information object in my reader, but I am uncertain how to get the data out on the ParaView side of things.

Example:

I want to get the Calendar date meta-data from my model file.  I added Key to the information object to the results info object.

I set keys as follows:


  request->AppendUnique(vtkExecutive::KEYS_TO_COPY(), vtkENLILMetaDataKeys::REFDATE_CAL());


I have a function to add the value to the key like such:


void vtkENLILMetaDataKeys::populate_meta_data(vtkInformation* request, vtkInformationStringKey *key, char* value)

{

  request->Set(key, value);

}


I then add the values to the keys as follows:


  vtkENLILMetaDataKeys::populate_meta_data(outInfo, vtkENLILMetaDataKeys::REFDATE_CAL(), temp);

After I do this, I can successfully pull the placed data from the information object from within the reader.

What I cannot figure out is how to access this object from within Paraview.

My goal is to be able to include the calendar date (as text) in the render view.

Can someone guide me in the correct direction on how to do this?  I am looking for possibly a python way of getting at this data.

Thanks,

Josh

Hi,

This is what I am doing:
Load a time-aware PVD file like this:

<?xml version="1.0"?>
 <VTKFile type="Collection" version="0.1" byte_order="LittleEndian"
compressor="vtkZLibDataCompressor">
   <Collection>
    <DataSet timestep="0.0" group="" part="0" file="vel_vec_0.vtr"/>
    <DataSet timestep="0.2" group="" part="0" file="vel_vec_1.vtr"/>
    <DataSet timestep="0.4" group="" part="0" file="vel_vec_2.vtr"/>
    <DataSet timestep="0.6" group="" part="0" file="vel_vec_3.vtr"/>
    <DataSet timestep="0.8" group="" part="0" file="vel_vec_4.vtr"/>
    <DataSet timestep="1.0" group="" part="0" file="vel_vec_5.vtr"/>

    <DataSet timestep="2.0" group="" part="0" file="vel_vec_10.vtr"/>
  </Collection>
</VTKFile>

Apply any of the 'temporal filters' including
-Temporal Cache w/ Cache size = 2
-Temporal Interpolator w/ Discrete Time Step Interval = 0.1
-Temporal Shift Scale w/ [default values]

to the loaded dataset.
I just press the play button on the the animation toolbar and it either
gives me this error message or crashes.

  ERROR: In
/home/utkarsh/Kitware/superbuild/paraview/src/paraview/VTK/Filtering/vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline.cxx,
line 934

vtkPVPostFilterExecutive (0x2d5d190): No maximum number of pieces has been
set in the information for output port 0 on algorithm
vtkPVPostFilter(0x2d26830).

I am using PV 3.14.0 (and .1) on Ubuntu.

Has anyone experienced the same problem?
If the developers are reading this, could you please let me know if that is
a bug or not? I really need to decide soon wether or not to use PV for
post-processing of some particle-tracing part.

Thanks in advance,
Mohamad

Ok, I miss understood your goal.

Then, the missing part should be something like that.

var view = paraview.GetRenderView(); // this is optional if you
already have a reference to the view...
view.setInteractionMode(2);

Although, I've quickly tried it online with firebug and I did not
manage to see the selection. I'm wondering if we are both missing
something here... Like the creation of a selection proxy that is
created to get the selected screen area and convert it to a set of
cellId...

Utkarsh might have a better insight on that selection part.

Seb

PS: Here is the mapping based on the string values

file: ParaView-SRC/ParaViewCore/ServerImplementation/Resources/views_and_representations.xml

A follow up on this problem.
If anyone is interested, I think it is a bug with the rectilinear vtk
reader (or any derivatives).
 I converted the same dataset to *.vtu format, and read the file series.
Did the same experiment with temporal filters and everything looked
perfectly fine. No error message or crashing.

Cheers,
Mohamad

A cylinder slice mode can certainly be added although I'm not sure we
have an interactive widget for that, I'll have to look. We can always
add one without an interactive widget. I've added a feature request
for the same: http://paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=13071

Subject: [Paraview] Rendering performance issue?
Message-ID: <589CEB614006334D93C1A48C1B1964C97F7B982401@srvmes03.spe-ch-md9.net>

Dear ParaView users & developers,

I am trying to reduce the time spent in performing generic 3D surface rendering. A lot has been achieved by using ParaView driven by python scripting already but actually I'd like to achieve more. At the time being, all rendering is performed using CPU rendering with the MESA libraries and I have started investigating if it could be worth performing the rendering using GPUs instead of using N CPUs in parallel.

For the purpose of checking the GPU performance over CPUs, I have devised a simple benchmark with a python script which drives the surface rendering. The script performs the generation of 60 images and dumps them onto disk in JPEG format. When performing this task, I have been tumbling upon the following rendering times for the generation of the aforementioned 60 images, using different versions of paraview on an "old" workstation, which is my guinea pig for this benchmark:

Paraview 3.8.1

Paraview 3.10.1

Paraview 3.12.0

Paraview 3.14.1

138.12s

591.06s

592.53s

594.10s


What is striking is that the rendering time is 4 times less(!) with PV v3.8.1 than with all subsequent versions. I had already noticed something similar when running MESA on dissimilar architectures, but I assumed that the culprit were the MESA libraries used. Here, the HW and libraries are the same, so I am enclined to believe that I am missing something here in the general rendering settings which do not affect PV v3.8.1 but induce a big performance hit for all PV versions above 3.10. Is anybody aware of rendering settings which could induce such a performance difference?

BTW, for each rendering, a window opens with the OpenGL tag in the window title bar, so I am quite sure that I am not using any SW rendering, all the more as all the PV versions I have compiled have VTK_OPENGL_HAS_OSMESA set to off.

A few more details concerning the test I have been running:

 - Workstation: Linux workstation with SuSE SLED 10
                         2 x Intel Xeon Dual core 5160  @ 3.00GHz
                         2 x NVIDIA Quadro FX3500 (NV71GL chipset)

 - Paraview version 3.8.1, 3.10.1, 3.12.0 and 3.14.1 were compiled with OpenGL support, Qt v4.6.x, python v2.7, OpenMPI v1.4.x using the GCC compiler v4.5.x.

 - The script is run using pvpython (and not pvbatch) in order to force the assignement of the graphics card:
    pvserver -display localhost:0.0
   Then the rendering script runs with pvpython from the command line. Within the script,  a Connect("localhost",11111) forces the connection to the pvserver running on localhost.

Any suggestions welcome.
Best regards
Frank Albina.

Just out of curiosity, can you compile ParaView without MPI or use the
ParaView binaries from paraview.org? I am asking this because we have been
tracking down a nasty rendering performance issue that only shows up when
ParaView is linked against MPI.

Subject: [Paraview] Access on widget properties
Message-ID: <001401cd17b0$cc6a8bb0$653fa310$@tu-cottbus.de>

Is there any kind of documentation how proxy groups (sources, representation
and so on) are reachable via the proxy manager? 

Thanks,

Betreff: Access on widget properties 

Hello,

I want to have access on the ?HandlePositions? property of a spline widget
(proxygroup="3d_widget_representations" proxyname="SplineRepresentation").
So I tried to search proxies and its properties via vtkSMProxyManager which
is similar to the way of the VR-Plugin. 

To try this approach I've create a new scene with a single Spline widget and
saved the state file. The widget representation is named as
"DataRepresentation1". I thought I can now have access on certain properties
- let's say "HandlePositions" - and change the values as I desire.
Unfortunately, this does not work:  

vtkSMProxy* Proxy = 
       vtkSMProxyManager::GetProxyManager()->
            GetActiveSessionProxyManager()->
            GetProxy( " DataRepresentation1" );

if(Proxy)
  {
  vtkSMDoubleVectorProperty* Property =
           vtkSMDoubleVectorProperty::SafeDownCast( 
              Proxy->GetProperty( " HandlePositions " ));

Subject: [Paraview] visualize atomistic data: memory hawk, crashing
Message-ID: <4F854622.9010001@icams.ruhr-uni-bochum.de>

Hey,
I have some (1e6) atomistic data in paraview (nice xyz filesupport). 
Visualizing it as points is possible and very fast, but squares don't 
look too hot as atoms. So I tried to switch to 3D Glyphs, and that is 
when the problem begins.

The memory consumption increases to a point where I run out of memory, 
when I use Filter->3D Glyphs and then choose "unmask" to see all atoms. 
When I choose the representation style (without Filter) as 3D Glyphs, 
the CPU usage increases and the software locks down.

On the other hand, there is software (Ovito, Tecplot) (which I don't 
want to use for some reason) that can display this amount of data in a 
1-4 seconds.

Is there some hint that some of the paraview users can give me? Did I 
overlook something pretty obvious?

Thanks for the help,
Steffen

Dear Berk!

Thank you very much for the reply.

Actually, I have been able to narrow down the issue I am having by using the enclosed script, which uses the paraview.simple.Sphere source to perform basic rendering. The output looks like this:

[cid:image004.jpg at 01CD1802.F17DD810]
Until now, all rendering I performed was done with MESA and I have been running the rendering scripts by setting renderView.UseOffscreenRenderingForScreenshots=1. Now, the interesting bit is that running OpenGL with this flag set to 1 does not make a big difference for my compiled version of ParaView 3.8.1 but it does for all subsequent versions. This is summarized in the table below, which gives the time spent in performing rendering and dumping the screenshots to file on my test HW:


ParaView 3.8.1

ParaView-3.10.1

ParaView-3.12.0

ParaView-3.14.1

UseOffscreenRenderingForScreenshots=1

50.68

327.39

322.7

324.77

UseOffscreenRenderingForScreenshots=0

41.21

43.94

38.66

38.62


For all the tests performed, I have been using pvbatch renderSpheres.py. I could recover for all PV versions 3.10.1, 3.12.0 and 3.14.1 the same rendering time as with UseOffscreenRenderingForScreenshots=1 by running pvbatch --use-offscreen-rendering renderSpheres.py, which is allegedly not supposed to work unless one uses software rendering. Is there any reason why I should not set the flag UseOffscreenRenderingForScreenshots  to  1 when running PV compiled against OpenGL in batch?
Also, with UseOffscreenRenderingForScreenshots=1, for each screenshot, a rendering window opens and closes every time, wherea with UseOffscreenRenderingForScreenshots=0, the rendering window stays open the whole time and rendering is much faster.

Also , out of curiosity, I have recompiled today morning the PV versions 3.8.1 & 3.14.1 without MPI support and with the same Qt, Python and gcc version (resp 4.6.4, 2.7.2, 4.5.3). Now the results are the following:


ParaView 3.8.1

ParaView-3.14.1

UseOffscreenRenderingForScreenshots=1

291.11

1099.74

UseOffscreenRenderingForScreenshots=0

52.42

36.19


The PV version 3.14.1 when setting UseOffscreenRenderingForScreenshots to 0 fails to generate a correct rendering (see below) while two spheres should be visible:

[cid:image005.jpg at 01CD1802.F17DD810]
For me, the only obvious reason for the performance difference here seems to be compilation without MPI support, but I will need to check that in more details.

Concerning the performance hit with MPI in parallel, I found that PV 3.8.1 was outperforming PV3.10.1 and PV3.12.0 when using offscreen-rendering with MESA. I do not have exact numbers, but there was a factor of 50% if I recall it correctly. As soon as I have more on this subject,  I'll let you know.

Hope this helps.

Cheers,

Frank.

Just out of curiosity, can you compile ParaView without MPI or use the ParaView binaries from paraview.org<http://paraview.org>? I am asking this because we have been tracking down a nasty rendering performance issue that only shows up when ParaView is linked against MPI.

Dear ParaView users & developers,

I am trying to reduce the time spent in performing generic 3D surface rendering. A lot has been achieved by using ParaView driven by python scripting already but actually I'd like to achieve more. At the time being, all rendering is performed using CPU rendering with the MESA libraries and I have started investigating if it could be worth performing the rendering using GPUs instead of using N CPUs in parallel.

For the purpose of checking the GPU performance over CPUs, I have devised a simple benchmark with a python script which drives the surface rendering. The script performs the generation of 60 images and dumps them onto disk in JPEG format. When performing this task, I have been tumbling upon the following rendering times for the generation of the aforementioned 60 images, using different versions of paraview on an "old" workstation, which is my guinea pig for this benchmark:

Paraview 3.8.1

Paraview 3.10.1

Paraview 3.12.0

Paraview 3.14.1

138.12s

591.06s

592.53s

594.10s


What is striking is that the rendering time is 4 times less(!) with PV v3.8.1 than with all subsequent versions. I had already noticed something similar when running MESA on dissimilar architectures, but I assumed that the culprit were the MESA libraries used. Here, the HW and libraries are the same, so I am enclined to believe that I am missing something here in the general rendering settings which do not affect PV v3.8.1 but induce a big performance hit for all PV versions above 3.10. Is anybody aware of rendering settings which could induce such a performance difference?

BTW, for each rendering, a window opens with the OpenGL tag in the window title bar, so I am quite sure that I am not using any SW rendering, all the more as all the PV versions I have compiled have VTK_OPENGL_HAS_OSMESA set to off.

A few more details concerning the test I have been running:

 - Workstation: Linux workstation with SuSE SLED 10
                         2 x Intel Xeon Dual core 5160  @ 3.00GHz
                         2 x NVIDIA Quadro FX3500 (NV71GL chipset)

 - Paraview version 3.8.1, 3.10.1, 3.12.0 and 3.14.1 were compiled with OpenGL support, Qt v4.6.x, python v2.7, OpenMPI v1.4.x using the GCC compiler v4.5.x.

 - The script is run using pvpython (and not pvbatch) in order to force the assignement of the graphics card:
    pvserver -display localhost:0.0
   Then the rendering script runs with pvpython from the command line. Within the script,  a Connect("localhost",11111) forces the connection to the pvserver running on localhost.

Any suggestions welcome.
Best regards
Frank Albina.

Message-ID: <CBAB1111.11B2%joshua.murphy@lasp.colorado.edu>

Hello,

I am trying to extract data from a CSV file via python, and I am having trouble.

I ran Trace to get the calls for how to go about opening the file? I can open the file manually, and look at the file information via the GUI, but I cannot seem to automate it via python..

The Trace routine gave me the following from a successful opening of the CSV file:
-----------------------------

try: paraview.simple
except: from paraview.simple import *
paraview.simple._DisableFirstRenderCameraReset()

actdata2_csv = CSVReader( DetectNumericColumns=1, MergeConsecutiveDelimiters=0, FieldDelimiterCharacters=',', FileName=['/Users/jjm390/LFM-Data/Zmhd2007-09-20T00/act-data2.csv'], UseStringDelimiter=1, HaveHeaders=1 )

AnimationScene4 = GetAnimationScene()
SpreadSheetView2 = CreateRenderView()
SpreadSheetView2.ColumnToSort = None
SpreadSheetView2.SelectionOnly = 0
SpreadSheetView2.BlockSize = 1024L
SpreadSheetView2.SelectedComponent = -1
SpreadSheetView2.InvertOrder = 0
SpreadSheetView2.ViewTime = 0.0

DataRepresentation2 = Show(actdata2_csv)
DataRepresentation2.CompositeDataSetIndex = 0
DataRepresentation2.FieldAssociation = 'Row Data'
DataRepresentation2.Visibility = 1

AnimationScene4.ViewModules = SpreadSheetView2

Render()

-----------------------------
But when I try to run this as a script, I get the following error:


Traceback (most recent call last):

File "<string>", line 16, in <module>

File "/usr/local/ParaView 3.12.0.app/Contents/Python/paraview/simple.py", line 209, in Show

raise RuntimeError, "Could not create a representation object for proxy %s" % proxy.GetXMLLabel()

RuntimeError: Could not create a representation object for proxy CSV Reader



Can someone tell me what I am doing wrong?  All I want to do is open the CSV file and use the data (locations) within to extract data from another data set (grid)?

Basically, if I can get into the table via python and query different cells, I will be all set? If the trace doesn't work, can someone please explain how to open a CSV file and load the data properly from within Python?

Thanks,
Josh

Samuel,
     I just wanted to thank you for your advice!  I am now in a situation 
where I have migrated to using the EnSight File Format and am successfully 
animating planetary trajectories in our solar system within the ParaView 
environment.  I would highly recommend the EnSight Gold File Format for 
anybody in a similar situation, such as:
     - Looking to animate scalars, vectors, and/or geometry over an 
extremely long period of time
     - In a situation where a file format still needs to be determined
     - Desires keeping the number of files on disk to a minimum

If interested I'd be happy to share some of the simulations I have managed 
to get out of ParaView.

Thank you again Samuel, the EnSight file format recommendation was a huge 
assistance to my efforts!     :)

-John

Re: [Paraview] Assistance/Suggestion With Animating Relatively Small

John,

Try this document, attached

Use EnSight 'Gold' format; start on page 3 of the *.pdf file

Included is the EnSight file-format checker program; it does not check the 
data just the file structure. Can be very helpful for quickly finding 
something you missed in the file's format structure.

Included is the file 'resultsesg.f' that is my Fortran90/95 subroutine 
(plus functions) for writing EnSight-formatted results. It is more 
complicated than what you need but uses the EnSight's 'part' construct. 
Start at line 955. (The coding before this is to write a time = 0.0 mesh 
file for checking my program's input data with ParaView.) 

Note that CBUFFER is always 80 characters no matter what you want to put 
in the results file including a 'blank,' that is, nothing. The EnSight 
reader expects an 80-character record at that position.

Regards,

Sam Key

this - I wanted to send a quick thank-you for your response.  The storage

http://www-vis.lbl.gov/NERSC/Software/ensight/doc/OnlineHelp/UM-C11.pdf 
Is this the correct format document I should be referring to?  If so - do 
you recommend a particular casefile format to examine?  This document 
appears to cover several: EnSight Gold, EnSight6, and EnSight5.   

     My next step will be to decipher this format enough to create a 
dataset that represents an unstructured grid of coordinate X,Y,Z points 
with each point having a distinct velocity vector over my time span.  If 
you happen to have a concise example of one of referenced 'VARIABLE' files 
- such as 'fmaego.data.nvel' - I believe that would help me greatly in 
decoding the format quicker.  Otherwise no worries, I already feel like 
this is a much more tangible approach and appreciate the help you have 
already offered!   

Thank You Again, 
     John

Re: [Paraview] Assistance/Suggestion With Animating Relatively Small 
Datasets Over Many Timesteps




John,

You might try the EnSight reader in ParaView. (I have used this format for 
many multiple-part models with a common time history.) It takes a little 
time to decipher the EnSight format but once you get it to work, it is 
very easy after that. The primary concept to keep in mind is that each 
part is an independently displayable graphics object. Each datum item 
(scalar or vector values assigned to cells and points) is kept in a 
separate file that contains all time steps. This storage scheme really 
cuts down on the number of files.

Using the EnSight-format's part construct, you can use the Extract Block 
filter to create a pipeline for each object, that is, do different 
graphics operations on each part independently. 

I have attached a typical EnSight 'case' file and a copy of the EnSight 
format document. Using EnSight-formatted input gives in my opinion, easy 
access to a wide selection of very useful filters.

Enjoy

First, thank you for the quick response I appreciate the input. 

I took at look at the state file you provided, and my first thoughts are 
suggesting that the Transform Filter may not provide exactly what I need.  


In your example you are using the Animation Control to interpolate 
parameters of the Transform Filter over time.  However I don't believe 
that any of the functions exposed 
by the Transform filter will help me actually remove Points along with the 
data in their associated Data Arrays.   

In terms of viewing the "Information" tab in the Object Inspector - I have 
a Dataset which has 2 Points, Several Arrays of Length 2 - and I would 
like to create multiple filters; each 
which would contain only 1 Point with Data Arrays of size 1.   

Would it be helpful if I provided a state file with my test datasets?

How about using a Transform Filter, possibly using scripting? Not sure if 
that works with timesteps, but I suppose it can be done. 
  
I made the following example for someone on the list recently, that shows 
animation of a transformfilter:

Subject: [Paraview] Assistance/Suggestion With Animating Relatively Small 
Datasets Over Many Timesteps 
 

   This is my first experience posting to the ParaView Mailing List; as 
well as my first project I am exploring with ParaView.  I hope I am 
posting this question to the correct audience. 

   I am attempting to create an animation of our Solar System - at an 
extremely high update interval - perhaps plotting the position and 
velocity of significant solar system bodies over 165 Earth years at 
a one day interval.  Initially I thought I would be able to work with CSV 
files to define a dataset which includes time, positional coordinates, and 
velocity vectors.  While testing this approach I managed to use the 
TableToPoints filter to create a visualization of a sample dataset; but I 
was not able to sequence over the individual timesteps.  So in effect you 
see all the positions a particular planet was at for the entire duration 
of the dataset. 

I created a video of this test and made it available online: 
   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLPxx-2Zc9Q 

   Next I thought perhaps the CSV format was a little too general for what 
I needed, so I read the VTK file format document and migrated over to the 
XML VTK format.  It seems like there is no way to define time sequenced 
data natively within the file format itself?  ParaView expects the user to 
break the timesteps into individual files - with a numeric indicator in 
the filename to define the sequence.  If I were to take this approach, I 
could be looking at creating nearly 500,000 individual files to represent 
the entire duration of time I'm interested in plotting.  I feel like there 
must be a better way to do this. 

   As a small improvement I thought I could at least combine all of the 
unique solar system bodies (Earth, Sun, etc.), into a single timestep file 
such as this: 
        (filename: timeseries_2455562.vtu) 

<?xml version="1.0"?> 
<VTKFile type="UnstructuredGrid" version="0.1" byte_order="LittleEndian"

        0 0 0 
      </DataArray> 
    </PointData> 
    <Points>

      <DataArray Name="offsets" type="Int32" format="ascii">1

      <DataArray Name="types" type="UInt8" format="ascii">1 1</DataArray> 
    </Cells> 
  </Piece> 
</UnstructuredGrid> 
</VTKFile> 

The idea of this approach was to list all of the scalars and vectors for 
each corresponding body in a single file.  In this example the first 
listed scalar, vector, or coordinate point, is the Earth while the second 
set of values indicates the Sun's data.  By combining the bodies into a 
single file I could reduce the 500,000 files required down to some 60,000 
files....still undesirable but better. 

However I would also like to segment the Points once inside the ParaView 
environment; so I can create a distinct pipeline for each body in the 
dataset.  One application for this would be to allow different Glyph 
rendering rules for the Sun and the Earth so I can make the Sun...have a 
Sun texture - and the Earth an Earth texture. 

After experimenting with this for awhile I found myself trying to 
implement a Programmable Filter.  The filter would take the Unstructured 
Grid for the given timestep, and given an index, extract the Point, 
Scalar, and Vector data from its input - then set only those values to the 
Output Unstructured Grid.  I currently have a script that looks something 
like this: 

# CELLID 0 = EARTH 
cellId = 0 

# Obtain References To Input/Output Data 
gridI = self.GetUnstructuredGridInput() 
gridO = self.GetUnstructuredGridOutput() 
dataI = self.GetInput() 
dataO = self.GetOutput() 
scalarI = dataI.GetPointData().GetScalars() 
vectorI = dataI.GetPointData().GetVectors() 

# Initialize Local Storage Arrays 
newVector = vtk.vtkFloatArray() 
newVector.SetName(vectorI.GetName()) 
newVector.SetNumberOfComponents(3) 
newScalar = vtk.vtkFloatArray() 
newScalar.SetName(scalarI.GetName()) 
newPoint = vtk.vtkPoints() 
newPoint.SetNumberOfPoints(1) 
newCell = vtk.vtkCellArray() 

# Lookup CellId References 
idCell = gridI.GetCell(cellId) 
idCellType = gridI.GetCellType(cellId) 
idPoint = gridI.GetPoints().GetPoint(cellId) 
idScalar = scalarI.GetTuple(cellId) 
idVector = vectorI.GetTuple(cellId) 

# Populate New Local Cell Array with CellId Cell 
newCell.InsertNextCell(idCell) 

# Populate New Local Point Array With CellId Point 
newPoint.SetPoint(0, idPoint) 

# Populate New Local Scalars with CellId Scalar Tuples 
newScalar.InsertNextTuple(idScalar) 

# Populate New Local Vectors with CellID Vector Tuples 
newVector.InsertNextTuple(idVector) 

# Copy Local Cells, Scalars, Vectors, and Points Into Output Pipeline Data 

gridO.SetPoints(newPoint) 
gridO.SetCells(idCellType, newCell) 
dataO.GetPointData().SetScalars(newScalar) 
dataO.GetPointData().SetVectors(newVector) 

The filter does achieve the desired effect for the cellID 0 - but when I 
switch the value of cellID to 1 (which should refer to the Sun's index) 
ParaView crashes hard - where I assume I am missing something, possibly 
requesting something out of bounds in memory. 

I've been struggling with this problem for a little while now and thought 
to share my progress here; hopefully there is somebody out there with a 
little more insight that could help guide me towards either a conclusion 
with this implementation or a suggestion for a better approach. 

Essentially - How can one give ParaView Point and Velocity vectors over a 
vast sequence of time without creating potentially hundreds of thousands 
of files on disc?  Does this Programmable Filter seem like a reasonable 
approach?  Is there a native feature I am missing that does this already? 
Is there some other file format other than VTK I could use to have 
ParaView understand this format of data? 

Any thoughts, comments, or questions will be greatly appreciated.  :) 

Thanks, 
   John

Frank,

Couple of things to note before share my results:

* When UseOffscreenRenderingForScreenshots is true, ParaView switches to
"offscreen rendering" mode for capturing the view and then switches back to
onscreen mode after the capture. VTK (since before PAraView 3.8) recreates
the window and context everytime one switches from onscreen to offscreen.
Recreating context implies the display lists need to be recreated, among
other things. When UseOffscreenRenderingForScreenshots is 1, I indeed see
the windows being created and destroyed for all versions of ParaView
(3.8.1, 3.10.1, 3.12.0, 3.14.1).

* From ParaView 3.10 on wards, you can additionally set
view.UseOffscreenRendering=1 to avoid the re-creating and destruction of
windows and you'll see similar times
whether UseOffscreenRenderingForScreenshots is ON or OFF. (Except 3.8,
since 3.8 doesn't have UseOffscreenRendering flag).

Using the official binaries on a NVidia Quadro 2000, I see the following
(where offscreen_mode == "UseOffscreenRenderingForScreenshots=1
and UseOffscreenRendering=1 (for PV >3.8.1)" ) and onscreen_mode ==
"UseOffscreenRendering=0, UseOffscreenRenderingForScreenshots=0"

Version     offscreen_mode  onscreen_mode
3.8.1         110.97*                 26.18
3.10.1        10.26                    9.65
3.12.0        10.45                    9.76
3.14.1        10.67                    9.99

Again, note that 3.8.1 offscree_mode timings include the context
creation/deletion time and since there's no easy way to avoid that in
3.8.1, we should take those with a pinch of salt.

Subject: [Paraview] Color Map Lookup Table
Message-ID: <CADukiX_6X7vzXFXGv3QjOhafMnWN+qm3wx19JLJR7+menfFadA@mail.gmail.com>

Good Morning

I was curious if anyone could provide assistance.  I am creating a
lookup_table for my scalar attribute using legacy VTK  file format.  The
coloring of my data is exactly as expected when I load the reader into
paraView, however when I add a glyph the correct color is not applied to
the glyph??

I realize that I can load a colormap (XML) into ParaView through "Edit
color map" and import, however I was hoping for the user to not have to do
this each time.  Everything works well when I use the lookup_table default
except that I don't have the option of specifying the opacity (without user
interference).  Any thoughts on why the glyph is not using the properties
of the lookup_table I created in VTK??

I appreciate any assistance.

Thank you

Tricia

I've built latest release of ParaViewWeb (3d3773e) with ParaView 3.14.0 and my data is not animating in PWApp.

It works with pv-3.10.1 release.


I have CMake build script like the ParaViewWeb SuperBuild at github.com/ktkirk/ParaViewWebBuild

Message-ID: <6CCDD8FC6578314C902BBF87D511D9D82665A54A@EXCHMBX01.fed.cclrc.ac.uk>

HI,
I can't seem to build the Linux-32 paraview on a RedHat 5 (I did build a 64 bit version already) , the 'make' process finishing with the following errors.


I checked, and it is not set in ccmake  to "use system hdf5", so I thought the hdf5 functions should be available from the Paraview included code, that is ParaView/VTK/Utilities/vtkhdf5/src/ ? 


Any advice will be appreciated
Thanks
Robert

Hi Kelly,

It seems that you found a bug.

I've double check on our server which as been updated using the
SuperBuild, and the error seems to be related on the way the
TimeKeeper proxy is fetch in the PWApp.

In the mean time, I've just push a fix. So if you update the
ParaViewWeb source, you should be good to go.

Thanks for your feedback,

Seb

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview bug with openFoam for oilflow with surface LIC
Message-ID: <29AF49AC-A088-421F-8CBF-73F9082F9367@gmail.com>

Hi all;
few times ago I learnt from this mailing list how to do an oilflow visualization with data from openFoam using the surface LIC.

Now, I noticed this only works if foamToVTK is run first.
If you try and do that using paraFoam you'll get nothing because you won't be able to select anything on the vectors field within the display tab.

I also noticed that if you run paraFoam, then load a .vtk surface on the same PV instance and do the surface LIC trick on the latter, then everything works also on the data from paraFoam you loaded at first.

Do know if this is actually a bug but I thought it would be worth mentioning?

Thank you!

Lorenzo

Do you know what version of Paraview you are using? I remember there was a
bug with this in 3.12 (if I remember correctly).

Looking at the xmls definition, no, it doesn't look like it supports
parallel. Dave, is that for real or an oversight?

Christopher,

You didn't say exactly what you want to do with such rotated data, so
I'll make a leap and assume you just want to display it in ParaView.

If that's the case, then within ParaView, you can set a transform on a
data object by selecting the object in the pipeline browser, selecting
the Display tab, and scrolling down to the bottom until you see the
Transformation section. Here you can apply a rotation by changing the
orientation.

You can define this rotation in an XML state file that you can then
import into ParaView. To generate an example, try loading an image in
ParaView, applying a transformation, selecting File->Save State, and
then examine the contents of the state file. Look for a Property
element with a name attribute "Orientation".

Hope that helps,
Cory

Thank you for the suggestion.

The reason for needing rotated data is that we have one application that
handles images from magnetic resonance cameras, these images come in the
form of 3d (and time resolved) volumes and 2d planes. We also have another
application (based on paraview) that is used to display these types of
images and do things such things as create streamline visualizations with
them.
The problem then is to get data from one application to the other,
preferably in a format that supports volume rendering in paraview.
Currently it appears that we will need to set a limit on one volume for
export and then reorient every 2d imageplane object to that volumes
orientation. This way we can get everything in the right position and also
get volume rendering of the volume data. But it is a bit less then pretty.

The idea of using state files is interesting, thank you for suggesting it,
I shall give it consideration. I have previously looked at the orientation
attribute and it appears to be locked to a 3d view, add the object to
another 3d view and the orientation is reset, this would be quite bad. But
perhaps I have just misunderstood it.

I vaguely recall that it won't work in parallel because we don't use
the parallel flavor of hdf5, and because we didn't want to
automatically gather before writing in serial.

John Biddiscombe, does this sound right to you?

Hi,

 

The calculator gives incorrect results for multiblock unless the
variables have the same index internally.  This can be reproduced with
the steps below:

 

1.       Create a python source that outputs vtkUnstructuredGrid with
the following script:

                output.GetPointData().AddArray(arr)

 

output = self.GetOutput()

npts = 8

pts.InsertNextPoint(-3.0, -1.0,  1.0)

pts.InsertNextPoint(-1.0, -1.0,  1.0)

pts.InsertNextPoint(-1.0,  1.0,  1.0)

pts.InsertNextPoint(-3.0,  1.0,  1.0)

output.SetPoints(pts)

output.Allocate(1,1)

ids = vtk.vtkIdList()

for i in range(npts):

    ids.InsertId(i,i) 

add_scalar(output, 2)

add_scalar(output, 1)

output.InsertNextCell(vtk.VTK_HEXAHEDRON, ids)

3.       Group the two python sources together

4.       Use the Calculator filter to pass through Scalar1

Subject: [Paraview] paravire crashed when dumping images during saving
	animation
Message-ID: <1334331440.36857.YahooMailNeo@web160103.mail.bf1.yahoo.com>

Dear Paraview experts,

I am wondering whether there is a solution to this problem.

I have completed a transient CFD analysis.? It contains a large dataset.? 
When I tried to saved the images of animation, Paraview crashed.? Paraview sometimes saved 50 images, sometimes saved 80 images, but, never completed the whole time steps.

I never had any problem when the dataset is small.


It will be appreciated if someone can shed some light on this.

Pei-Ying

What version of ParaView are you using? Are you using OSMesa, Offscreen
rendering? Are you saving animations with pvpython or from the GUI? Is this
client-server or builtin configuration?

Subject: [Paraview] PV3.14.1 STL reader *could* be broken.

Dear all!

I have just found out that the STL reader is broken under my Linux 64 bits distro for both the PV3.14.1 binaries either compiled from source or downloaded from paraview.org. The linux distribution I am using is SuSE SLED10 SP2. The error message I am getting is:

ERROR: In /home/utkarsh/Kitware/superbuild/paraview/src/paraview/VTK/IO/vtkSTLReader.cxx, line 446
vtkSTLReader (0x1bba420): STLReader error reading file: susp-rr-tlink-E0000-0001-lhs.stl Premature EOF while reading end solid.

I have enclosed to this email a simple STL file with which I could reproduce the issue. Note  that this issue does not happen with PV 3.12.0.

A similar error happens with PV3.14.0 & PV3.14.1 under Windows 64bits, but not up to the point of making the application crash. Here is the error message:


ERROR: In ..\..\..\..\src\VTK\IO\vtkSTLReader.cxx, line 446

vtkSTLReader (000000000E7AA380): STLReader error reading file: C:\Documents and Settings\fal\Desktop\DUMMY.stl Premature EOF while reading end solid.

The STL file is displayed correctly though after the error message window is closed:

Hope this helps improving PV.

Cheers,

Frank.

Dear Paraview experts,

I am wondering whether there is a solution to this problem.

I have completed a transient CFD analysis.? It contains a large dataset.? 
When I tried to saved the images of animation, Paraview crashed.? Paraview sometimes saved 50 images, sometimes saved 80 images, but, never completed the whole time steps.

I never had any problem when the dataset is small.


It will be appreciated if someone can shed some light on this.

Pei-Ying

Subject: [Paraview] Recommended Data Format
Message-ID: <4F885A0E.9000003@ices.utexas.edu>

I am working on an academic Discontinuous Petrov-Galerkin finite element
code and would like to output to a Paraview readable format, but there
are so many options, I'm not sure where to start. So I am looking for
some recommendations.

Our requirements are as follows. Our code makes heavy use of adaptive
mesh refinement resulting in hanging nodes with both triangles and
quads, so our mesh is fairly complex. Further complicating things, in
addition to standard field variables we have trace DOFs that only live
on element edges which we would like to be able to visualize. One of my
co-authors on the code has implemented a Matlab script to plot these
things, but this is obviously not very portable.

Any suggestions?

Hi Utkarsh!

Thank you very much for your help. You made my day. Indeed, all PV versions from PV3.10 are much faster when the flag view.UseOffscreenRendering=1 is set.  Now, I am down to roughly 85s instead of the 595s reported in my first email for all versions 3.10.1, 3.12.0 and 3.14.1.

I will rerun our benchmark with MESA on my guinea pig computer and I will share the results on this forum. This is of interest for me since I need to check the parallel efficiency between all versions as well, which will help me decide if I remain with MESA rendering or not.

Cheers,

Frank.

Subject: Re: [Paraview] Rendering performance issue?

Frank,

Couple of things to note before share my results:

* When UseOffscreenRenderingForScreenshots is true, ParaView switches to "offscreen rendering" mode for capturing the view and then switches back to onscreen mode after the capture. VTK (since before PAraView 3.8) recreates the window and context everytime one switches from onscreen to offscreen. Recreating context implies the display lists need to be recreated, among other things. When UseOffscreenRenderingForScreenshots is 1, I indeed see the windows being created and destroyed for all versions of ParaView (3.8.1, 3.10.1, 3.12.0, 3.14.1).

* From ParaView 3.10 on wards, you can additionally set view.UseOffscreenRendering=1 to avoid the re-creating and destruction of windows and you'll see similar times whether UseOffscreenRenderingForScreenshots is ON or OFF. (Except 3.8, since 3.8 doesn't have UseOffscreenRendering flag).

Using the official binaries on a NVidia Quadro 2000, I see the following (where offscreen_mode == "UseOffscreenRenderingForScreenshots=1 and UseOffscreenRendering=1 (for PV >3.8.1)" ) and onscreen_mode == "UseOffscreenRendering=0, UseOffscreenRenderingForScreenshots=0"

Version     offscreen_mode  onscreen_mode
3.8.1         110.97*                 26.18
3.10.1        10.26                    9.65
3.12.0        10.45                    9.76
3.14.1        10.67                    9.99

Again, note that 3.8.1 offscree_mode timings include the context creation/deletion time and since there's no easy way to avoid that in 3.8.1, we should take those with a pinch of salt.

Dear Berk!

Thank you very much for the reply.

Actually, I have been able to narrow down the issue I am having by using the enclosed script, which uses the paraview.simple.Sphere source to perform basic rendering. The output looks like this:

[cid:image001.jpg at 01CD19A8.03F9B8F0]
Until now, all rendering I performed was done with MESA and I have been running the rendering scripts by setting renderView.UseOffscreenRenderingForScreenshots=1. Now, the interesting bit is that running OpenGL with this flag set to 1 does not make a big difference for my compiled version of ParaView 3.8.1 but it does for all subsequent versions. This is summarized in the table below, which gives the time spent in performing rendering and dumping the screenshots to file on my test HW:


ParaView 3.8.1

ParaView-3.10.1

ParaView-3.12.0

ParaView-3.14.1

UseOffscreenRenderingForScreenshots=1

50.68

327.39

322.7

324.77

UseOffscreenRenderingForScreenshots=0

41.21

43.94

38.66

38.62


For all the tests performed, I have been using pvbatch renderSpheres.py. I could recover for all PV versions 3.10.1, 3.12.0 and 3.14.1 the same rendering time as with UseOffscreenRenderingForScreenshots=1 by running pvbatch --use-offscreen-rendering renderSpheres.py, which is allegedly not supposed to work unless one uses software rendering. Is there any reason why I should not set the flag UseOffscreenRenderingForScreenshots  to  1 when running PV compiled against OpenGL in batch?
Also, with UseOffscreenRenderingForScreenshots=1, for each screenshot, a rendering window opens and closes every time, wherea with UseOffscreenRenderingForScreenshots=0, the rendering window stays open the whole time and rendering is much faster.

Also , out of curiosity, I have recompiled today morning the PV versions 3.8.1 & 3.14.1 without MPI support and with the same Qt, Python and gcc version (resp 4.6.4, 2.7.2, 4.5.3). Now the results are the following:


ParaView 3.8.1

ParaView-3.14.1

UseOffscreenRenderingForScreenshots=1

291.11

1099.74

UseOffscreenRenderingForScreenshots=0

52.42

36.19


The PV version 3.14.1 when setting UseOffscreenRenderingForScreenshots to 0 fails to generate a correct rendering (see below) while two spheres should be visible:

[cid:image002.jpg at 01CD19A8.03F9B8F0]
For me, the only obvious reason for the performance difference here seems to be compilation without MPI support, but I will need to check that in more details.

Concerning the performance hit with MPI in parallel, I found that PV 3.8.1 was outperforming PV3.10.1 and PV3.12.0 when using offscreen-rendering with MESA. I do not have exact numbers, but there was a factor of 50% if I recall it correctly. As soon as I have more on this subject,  I'll let you know.

Hope this helps.

Cheers,

Frank.

Just out of curiosity, can you compile ParaView without MPI or use the ParaView binaries from paraview.org<http://paraview.org>? I am asking this because we have been tracking down a nasty rendering performance issue that only shows up when ParaView is linked against MPI.

Dear ParaView users & developers,

I am trying to reduce the time spent in performing generic 3D surface rendering. A lot has been achieved by using ParaView driven by python scripting already but actually I'd like to achieve more. At the time being, all rendering is performed using CPU rendering with the MESA libraries and I have started investigating if it could be worth performing the rendering using GPUs instead of using N CPUs in parallel.

For the purpose of checking the GPU performance over CPUs, I have devised a simple benchmark with a python script which drives the surface rendering. The script performs the generation of 60 images and dumps them onto disk in JPEG format. When performing this task, I have been tumbling upon the following rendering times for the generation of the aforementioned 60 images, using different versions of paraview on an "old" workstation, which is my guinea pig for this benchmark:

Paraview 3.8.1

Paraview 3.10.1

Paraview 3.12.0

Paraview 3.14.1

138.12s

591.06s

592.53s

594.10s


What is striking is that the rendering time is 4 times less(!) with PV v3.8.1 than with all subsequent versions. I had already noticed something similar when running MESA on dissimilar architectures, but I assumed that the culprit were the MESA libraries used. Here, the HW and libraries are the same, so I am enclined to believe that I am missing something here in the general rendering settings which do not affect PV v3.8.1 but induce a big performance hit for all PV versions above 3.10. Is anybody aware of rendering settings which could induce such a performance difference?

BTW, for each rendering, a window opens with the OpenGL tag in the window title bar, so I am quite sure that I am not using any SW rendering, all the more as all the PV versions I have compiled have VTK_OPENGL_HAS_OSMESA set to off.

A few more details concerning the test I have been running:

 - Workstation: Linux workstation with SuSE SLED 10
                         2 x Intel Xeon Dual core 5160  @ 3.00GHz
                         2 x NVIDIA Quadro FX3500 (NV71GL chipset)

 - Paraview version 3.8.1, 3.10.1, 3.12.0 and 3.14.1 were compiled with OpenGL support, Qt v4.6.x, python v2.7, OpenMPI v1.4.x using the GCC compiler v4.5.x.

 - The script is run using pvpython (and not pvbatch) in order to force the assignement of the graphics card:
    pvserver -display localhost:0.0
   Then the rendering script runs with pvpython from the command line. Within the script,  a Connect("localhost",11111) forces the connection to the pvserver running on localhost.

Any suggestions welcome.
Best regards
Frank Albina.

Attached is a simple python script that shows how to make a selection
for cell visible cells through Python. You can use something similar
to setup a plugin for ParaViewWeb to make your selections and set them
up.

Is your ParaView built with FFMPEG support? Try saving a "png" e.g.
"movie.png" instead of "movie.avi", does that work? In that case, your
ParaView is not built with FFMPEG support and cannot write AVI files.

Sorry, I'm not sure exactly how to reproduce this. With git-master
(which should be same as 3.14. for the most part), I don't seem to
have issues picking the vector field to use on the display tab.

Dave et al,

The XdmfWriter in paraview won't write in parallel. The main reason being that the hyperslab assignment just isn't implemented for a dataset which is split into pieces, and for a multiblock dataset there is no provision to write one block per dataset into the file.

We implemented our own version which does write in parallel, but the code is/has been unused for some time (almost certainly broken now) and relies on fudges we made to Xdmf which although they worked very well, haven't been maintained because I had hoped to port the lot to the new Xdmf which is a much cleaner code and supports 'visitor' style patterns natively which makes it easier to hook custom actions to a tree of datasets traversal (such as writing out to file)

Our writer used this small utility library to help out
https://hpcforge.org/plugins/mediawiki/wiki/libh5mb/index.php/Main_Page

If it was a matter of life and death, I could probably get the code working (the vtkXdmfWriter2 or whatever we called it), but it'd take a couple of days and isn't something I was desperately in need of right now.

Off topic: I started work on porting all our xdmf developments to the 'new' xdmf library but when I saw how much work was needed for the vtkXdmfReader I gave up (I did get the XdmfGenerator project running with the new library https://hpcforge.org/plugins/mediawiki/wiki/xdmfgenerator/index.php/Main_Page , but not production ready and certain features like JOIN $1,$2,$3 were not yet supported in Xdmf2, which we really needed for our stuff). I'd like to revisit this whole topic and would welcome encouragement. Since the Xdmf chaps have not been very active on the lists, it has been hard to work up much enthusiasm to develop/extend the codes....

JB

I vaguely recall that it won't work in parallel because we don't use the parallel flavor of hdf5, and because we didn't want to automatically gather before writing in serial.

John Biddiscombe, does this sound right to you?

I had been trying to rebuild ParaView, and finally successed.

I installed Qt at /usr/local, and cmake couldn't find QtWebKit libraries.
I couldn't look up them by "find" command, but they were in
/usr/local/include/QtWebKit, and QtWebKit Library was in
/usr/local/lib/libQtWebKit.so.4.#.#.
I set these libraries on cmake's CUI, and built ParaView successfully.
(Qt 4.7.4 dumped errors on making ParaView, so I used Qt 4.6.4.)

But when I started ParaView, I got an error about shared QtWebKit library.
I made a symbolic link of libQtWebKit.so.4 in /usr/local/lib/paraview,
then ParaView was started successfully.

Hi Frank,


I have same errors about STL Reader on ParaView 3.14.0.
When I read STL data on Linux (CentOS 5.3), ParaView may be terminated irregularly.
If on Windows (Windows XP SP3), ParaView dumps errors, but still works.
And these problems may be depends on ASCII STL data only.
Binary STLs are imported safely.

If you want to import STLs right now, how about using Binary format?
Some ASCII to Binary STL converters are distributed on the web.

And also I hope above bugs are modified.

Subject: [Paraview] Problems positioning image slices in 3D
Message-ID: <CA+V7QS-df9aUW=zJUUoQXOVY=Ok4a-WfzK_bbMQEsDVkS4sgfw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I have a set of slices extracted from a 3D volume. These slices have
been processed with image magick to produce a transparent background
and a colour overlay. I can load several into paraview, feed them
through the image to pointset filter and then transform them so that
they are in a 3D stack with space between each slice. The problem is
that the transparent background isn't properly transparent. Depending
on the angle I view at, the background definitely obscures slices
behind it. It seems arbitrary whether this occurs when viewing from
above or below (note that I don't mean it changes as I'm viewing a
given data set, but if I load in an equivalent dataset at the same
time, it is likely to behave differently to the first. It almost
appears as though the front face can be either side of the image. I'm
finding it tough to describe without a screenshot.

Does this ring any bells with anyone? Is it possible to flip the
direction of front? Is there some other way I should read this data
(currently starting as png with an alpha channel). One option I've
considered is deleting the transparent points after conversion to a
point set, but I can't see how to do that.

All advice welcome.

Thanks

Hi everyone

I'm having a problem with applying filters using python and paraview

I can load the data file and change the colors but when I apply filters I
can not see any changes

I'm using paraview version 3.14.0

and this is an example of the code I'm trying to run

>>> from paraview import servermanager
paraview version 3.14.0, Date: 2012-02-17
>>> servermanager.Connect()
Connection (builtin:) [1]
>>> reader = servermanager.sources.ExodusIIReader()
>>> reader.FileName = "/home/......./disk_out_ref.ex2"
>>> view = servermanager.CreateRenderView()
>>> repRed = servermanager.CreateRepresentation(reader, view)
>>> view.ResetCamera()
>>> view.StillRender()
>>> clipper = servermanager.filters.Clip(Input = reader)
>>> plane = servermanager.implicit_functions.Plane()
>>> plane.Normal = [0.5,0.5, 0.0]
>>> clipper.ClipFunction = plane
>>> repClip  = servermanager.CreateRepresentation(clipper , view)
>>> view1.ResetCamera()
>>> view1.StillRender()


I hope someone can help

thanks

BTW, I've added bug to easily disable WebKit in ParaView. Though
certain components may not work, at least ParaView should build easily
without webkit (http://vtk.org/Bug/view.php?id=13061)

Try that,

from paraview.simple import *

reader = OpenDataFile( "/home/......./disk_out_ref.ex2" )
Show()
Render()

clip = Clip(reader)
clip.ClipType.Normal = [.5,.5,0]
Show(clip)
Render()

Hide(reader)
Render()

That should do what you script was doing. But at the end I make sure
that I hide the full data so I can see the clip of that data.

It's hard to say  what could be going wrong. What file format is your
dataset in? Is ParaView running out of memory?

Hi, Utkarsh,

>What file format is yourdataset in?

VTK.

>Is ParaView running out of memory?

Possible.? However, when I advanced each time step and saved the screen shot "manually", I was able to save the pictures of all time steps.? So, maybe the computer/paraview cannot reload the data fast enough.

Is there a way to put in a "delay" time between each time step when saving animation?

It's hard to say? what could be going wrong. What file format is your
dataset in? Is ParaView running out of memory?

No I probably not build with FFMPEG support because it's "work in png".
It's output image0000.png, image0001.png, image0003.png ...

Thanks,

Subject: [Paraview] MPI Socket in use
Message-ID: <D221FCC2799E6E479EB2FECD977F77A601778CE3@EXCHANGE0.exponent.com>

I just built paraview on an opensuse linux box.  When I use the GUI, and a single connection it seems to work fine.  But, if I try to use multiple CPUs, or run with mpi, it fails.
I do have OpenMPI installed.  
When I first started getting the error, I googled around some and found that maybe "make install" would help (I had been running it just in the build directory).  But I am getting the same error after installing.  I also added my openmpi libraries to LD_LIBRARY_PATH (when I first tried to run it I had other errors about a shared library).

I did build with PARAVIEW_USE_MPI set to on.  It looks as though one pvserver will run, but any additional ones finds a port in use.  Clearly something is not right about how MPI is being handled, but I am not sure how to fix it.


If I try mpirun, here is error I get:


mpiexec -np 3  pvserver

It seems that [at least] one of the processes that was started with
mpirun did not invoke MPI_INIT before quitting (it is possible that
more than one process did not invoke MPI_INIT -- mpirun was only
notified of the first one, which was on node n0).

mpirun can *only* be used with MPI programs (i.e., programs that
invoke MPI_INIT and MPI_FINALIZE).  You can use the "lamexec" program
to run non-MPI programs over the lambooted nodes.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
mpirun failed with exit status 252
 
And suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

You may want to verify PARAVIEW_USE_MPI flag again and ensure that the
pvserver you're running is indeed the one that has PARAVIEW_USE_MPI
set to ON. The problem you're seeing is typical when ParaView not
built with MPI.

I am sure that I use ccmake and changed PARAVIEW_USE_MPI to ON, (I also enabled python and pointed to the open mpi compiler, so that it then filled in most of the variables for MPI, as the note explains).  Then I did configure and generate.  Finally I did make, and sudo make install.  All seemed to work fine, and paraview runs fine, with a single processor.  
I even went so far and to make a new, empty directory, and rebuilt it there.  With the same results.
I have also tried to explicitly put in the correct path, just to make sure that there isn't some other pvserver around:
mpirun -np 3 /home/dersh/projects/ParaView-bin/bin/pvserver
with exactly the same results.
I have gone back, and now I see that MPIEXEC_MAX_NUMPROCS and VTK_MPI_MAX_NUMPROCS are set to 2.  But, I get the same error if I try to run it with -np 2, so clearly just using MPI is failing.  A 

I realized that the problem is consistent with it not being built with MPI, but I definitely set it on.  Are there some other variables that have to be set?  Clearly something is not being built correctly, but I am not sure what it is.

Thanks,

Hi!

Some time ago I tried to built ParaView with MPI and noticed that even if variables 
MPI_{CXX,C}_COMPILER pointed to the right compilers (mpicxx and mpicc respectively), the 
compilers from CMAKE_{CXX,C}_COMPILER variables were used (g++ and gcc).

Try turning on CMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE and look what exactly happens.

P.S. What is the difference between MPI_{CXX,C}_COMPILER and CMAKE_{CXX,C}_COMPILER 
variables?

Subject: [Paraview] vtkSource as output of a paraview plugin filter
Message-ID: <83FB51056FB3664CB2A09728F5E9187701BA5994@email.ktk.uni-leipzig.de>

Dear All

 

I managed to write a PV plugin which fits a sphere to points selected on a poly data object. I can pass the sphere as the output of the filter - fine. But now I would like to  be able to interactively adjust the radius of the sphere to perform some measurements. The way I implemented the filter, this is not possible because the sphere is not a sphere to PV but a 3D object of any shape. So, is it possible to generate a vtkSource out of a PV plugin?

 

Any help would be highly appreciated.

 

Thanks - Peter.

Do you mind posting your CMakeCache.txt file? Also do a "ldd
libvtkParallel.so". Let's verify that vtkParallel is linking against
MPI libs.

Attached are the results of ldd libvtkParallel.so (looks to me like it is linking MPI stuff).  And also CMakeCache.txt

Sometimes, depending on the process launcher being used by MPI you don't
get the same environment in your current shell as you get from the
mpiexeced environment, since interactive shells behave differently than
non-interactive shells in regards to what dot files they read and/or don't
read.

you should try an
ssh ldd /home/dersh/projects/ParaView-bin/bin/pvserver
or
rsh ldd /home/dersh/projects/ParaView-bin/bin/pvserver
if you get the same output as
ldd /home/dersh/projects/ParaView-bin/bin/pvserver
I'm barking up the wrong tree.

Good Luck,
--John.

Subject: [Paraview] setting the Glyph filter' SetScaleFactor value in a macro
Message-ID: <4F8DC553.9020902@cs.unc.edu>

I am writing a ParaView macro to apply several glyph filters on the same 
data set.  Each filter wants to set its own SetScaleFactor value, but I 
am trying to override the default to make each glyph filter scale 
correctly with the other filters.  I can't seem to get the expected 
behavior out of the filter.

Here's my test case, as a ParaView macro:
	vector1 = 'vector1'
	scalar1 = 'scalar1'
	vector2 = 'vector2'
	scalar2 = 'scalar2'
	
	s = Wavelet()
	Show(s)
	Hide(s)
	s = Calculator(
		Function='RTData*5-6',
		ResultArrayName=scalar1 )
	Show(s)
	Hide(s)
	s = Calculator(
		Function='RTData*sin(coordsX)',
		ResultArrayName=scalar2)
	Show(s)
	Hide(s)
	s = Gradient(
		Dimensionality='Three',
		SelectInputScalars=['POINTS', 'scalar2'] )
	Show(s)
	Hide(s)
	s = Gradient(
		Dimensionality='Three',
		SelectInputScalars=['POINTS', 'scalar1'] )
	Show(s)
	Hide(s)
	s = Calculator(
		Function='scalar1Gradient',
		ResultArrayName=vector1 )
	Show(s)
	Hide(s)
	s =  Calculator(
		Function='scalar2Gradient',
		ResultArrayName=vector2 )
	Show(s)
	Hide(s)
	arrowGlyph = Glyph(
		Input=s,
		ScaleMode='scalar',
		MaskPoints=0,
		Vectors=['POINTS', vector1],
		Scalars=['POINTS', scalar1],
		GlyphTransform="Transform2",
		GlyphType="Arrow",
		Orient=1 )
	arrowGlyph.SetScaleFactor = 0.01
	Show(arrowGlyph)
	arrowGlyph = Glyph(
		Input=s,
		ScaleMode='scalar',
		MaskPoints=0,
		Vectors=['POINTS', vector2],
		Scalars=['POINTS', scalar2],
		GlyphTransform="Transform2",
		GlyphType="Arrow",
		Orient=1 )
	arrowGlyph.SetScaleFactor = 0.01
	Show(arrowGlyph)
	Render()

Any idea what I can do differently?

Thanks,

The addresses are different, but the shared objects seem to be the same.

Got it!!!!
Yes, there were, but I had not realized it before (not sure why they were floating around).  If I use the "correct" runmpi it now works.

Thank you much!

Hi guys, I have asked this question few days ago. Has anyone seen the same
problem?

Hi,

This is what I am doing:
Load a time-aware PVD file like this:

<?xml version="1.0"?>
 <VTKFile type="Collection" version="0.1" byte_order="LittleEndian"
compressor="vtkZLibDataCompressor">
   <Collection>
    <DataSet timestep="0.0" group="" part="0" file="vel_vec_0.vtr"/>
    <DataSet timestep="0.2" group="" part="0" file="vel_vec_1.vtr"/>
    <DataSet timestep="0.4" group="" part="0" file="vel_vec_2.vtr"/>
    <DataSet timestep="0.6" group="" part="0" file="vel_vec_3.vtr"/>
    <DataSet timestep="0.8" group="" part="0" file="vel_vec_4.vtr"/>
    <DataSet timestep="1.0" group="" part="0" file="vel_vec_5.vtr"/>
    <DataSet timestep="1.2" group="" part="0" file="vel_vec_6.vtr"/>
    <DataSet timestep="1.4" group="" part="0" file="vel_vec_7.vtr"/>
    <DataSet timestep="1.6" group="" part="0" file="vel_vec_8.vtr"/>
    <DataSet timestep="1.8" group="" part="0" file="vel_vec_9.vtr"/>
    <DataSet timestep="2.0" group="" part="0" file="vel_vec_10.vtr"/>
  </Collection>
</VTKFile>

Apply any of the 'temporal filters' including
-Temporal Cache w/ Cache size = 2
-Temporal Interpolator w/ Discrete Time Step Interval = 0.1
-Temporal Shift Scale w/ [default values]

to the loaded dataset.
I just press the play button on the the animation toolbar and it either
gives me this error message or crashes.

  ERROR: In
/home/utkarsh/Kitware/superbuild/paraview/src/paraview/VTK/Filtering/vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline.cxx,
line 934

vtkPVPostFilterExecutive (0x2d5d190): No maximum number of pieces has been
set in the information for output port 0 on algorithm
vtkPVPostFilter(0x2d26830).

I am using PV 3.14.0 (and .1) on both Ubuntu and Windows.

Has anyone experienced the same problem?
If the developers are reading this, could you please let me know if that is
a bug or not? I really need to decide soon wether or not to use PV for
post-processing of some particle-tracing part.

Thanks in advance,
Mohamad

****************************
A follow up on this problem.
if anyone is interested, I think it is a bug with the *rectilinear* vtk
reader (or any derivatives).
I converted the same dataset to *.vtu format, and read the file series. Did
the same experiment with temporal filters and everything looked perfectly
fine. No error message or crashing.

Is there any way this patch was rolled back into the 3.14.0 pre-built binaries?    We're pushing 3.14.0 as our current default and I'm now getting bit by this enumeration bug.     I'm not really interested in pushing 3.14.1 if I can help it.  8-)

The bug that I'm hitting is that I have enumeration strings and regardless of which string I pick, I'm getting the default value as the setting .....

Burlen,

Attached is a patch. Can you please verify if that solves the issue?
Seems to working now in my tests.

Rick,

The 3.14.1 prebuilt binaries will work just fine with 3.14.0 servers,
so you can just use the 3.14.1 prebuilt binaries without having to
update your servers to 3.14.1.

Thanks.  3.14.1 is working as advertised and resolves the issue.

Rick,

The 3.14.1 prebuilt binaries will work just fine with 3.14.0 servers,
so you can just use the 3.14.1 prebuilt binaries without having to
update your servers to 3.14.1.

Hi Mohamad,

I've been quietly following this thread in hopes that your interest in 
particle tracing will spark a response from the developers. I was unable 
to generate pathlines in image data in vti format I beleive I was using 
3.10.0 at the time. It was not clear to me if there was a bug or if I 
had the pipeline built incorrectly out of my own ignorance on how this 
works in PV. I posted a question with test data hoping for some advise, 
http://paraview.markmail.org/message/ek67niwr7xagaajz?q=burlen+order:date-backward&page=15 
however I did not receive any reply.

Hi Burlen,

I am hoping that Utkarsh could help figure things out.
If you elaborate more on what you do and what happens, I could at least
share my experience.
I use *.vtr type files to generate particle trace and pathlines.
The problem I have/had is that as soon as I apply any Temporal Filter to
the *.vtr file series, it either gives me error message or crashes.
I was very very very lucky that I found out that for the same dataset, if I
use *.vtu format, no problems or crashing occurred. So, for now, I just
used a Clip filter to extract my data into a *.vtu format and rewrite them,
re-read them and do the ParticleTrace and ParticlePathlines.
That was my experience.

Let me know if I could be of any help.
Good luck,
Mohamad

If using a VTU works and a VTR crashes, then it's definitely a bug.

I've been working on temporal fixes for a long time (i.e. not working hard), and eventually I will commit something that resolves this, but in the meantime, you should use vtu.

Hi Burlen,

I am hoping that Utkarsh could help figure things out.
If you elaborate more on what you do and what happens, I could at least share my experience.
I use *.vtr type files to generate particle trace and pathlines.
The problem I have/had is that as soon as I apply any Temporal Filter to the *.vtr file series, it either gives me error message or crashes.
I was very very very lucky that I found out that for the same dataset, if I use *.vtu format, no problems or crashing occurred. So, for now, I just used a Clip filter to extract my data into a *.vtu format and rewrite them, re-read them and do the ParticleTrace and ParticlePathlines.

Message-ID: <CA+hih1qGwkt6xX+tutzGczweu_5zED50o1_g-sbGK_mvAPxScQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I've got two 2D contour lines from two different scalars which intersect at
multiple points. I'm interested in finding the coordinates of these points.
Is it possible to do this programmatically in ParaView?

I suspect it might need some Python scripting, but I'm not sure how so any
tips or ideas would be very helpful.

Message-ID: <CANwS1=GDAQRamwOFGRDgrGjOBLCD08h7Lc+hvRgTnmABpqaofA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I'm having trouble getting pvserver to run on OS X.  If I run just a
single instance of pvserver everything works fine and I'm able to
connect ParaView to it.  But if I do this:

mpirun -np 4 /path/to/pvserver

then all the pvserver processes spin their wheels, taking up 100% of
the CPU, and if I try to connect ParaView, then ParaView freezes until
the pvserver processes are killed.  A stack trace of the pvserver
processes yields the following:

#0  0x00007fff87c77e46 in swtch_pri ()
#1  0x00007fff87d5301f in sched_yield ()

This occurs on OS X 10.6 and OS X 10.7.  This is with ParaView 3.14.1,
using the system MPI that is located in /usr/lib, and compiled with
RelWithDebInfo.  The client and server are on the same machine, and
are part of the same build.

I might be missing some important step, because this is the first time
that I've tried running ParaView in client/server mode.  Any help is
appreciated.

David,

The 100% CPU for pvserver is expected. It's what the MPI
implementation does for waiting processes. The locking when paraview
connects is fishy. Any more details there? ANy output text or
something?

Here is what I see when I run pvserver and paraview:

mpirun -np 2 /Applications/ParaView.app/Contents/bin/pvserver
Waiting for client...
Connection URL: cs://sfmrc-678.crha-health.ab.ca:11111
[ after this, two pvserver processes are running, nothing else is printed ]

In another shell:

/Applications/ParaView.app/Contents/MacOS/paraview

ParaView comes up, and when I try to connect to pvserver, there are no
errors reported but paraview hangs and doesn't print any information.

If I kill the pvserver processes at this point, then paraview comes
back to life and prints the following in the "Output Messages" window:

vtkSMSessionClient (0x123996cc0): Some error in socket processing.

=====

So it seems that paraview is able to find the server, but is unable to
get it to respond.

Message-ID: <SNT138-W34DF0A2FC71A47D9D90B9ED13D0@phx.gbl>


I'm trying to make ParaView 3.12.0 on Cygwin because I want to use it with a plugin that requires shared libraries (this one: http://web678.public1.linz.at/Drupal/?q=node/620). I get the following error:

I'm new to compiling and I don't know what to do with this, why FILE etc are not declared or what they should be.



--------- 
Also: this may have nothing to do with it, but when I was running ccmake, I got this:


   CMake Warning at /usr/share/cmake-2.8.7/Modules/Platform/CYGWIN.cmake:15 (message):
   CMake no longer defines WIN32 on Cygwin!


   (1) If you are just trying to build this project, ignore this warning or
   quiet it by setting CMAKE_LEGACY_CYGWIN_WIN32=0 in your environment or in
   the CMake cache. If later configuration or build errors occur then this
   project may have been written under the assumption that Cygwin is WIN32.
   In that case, set CMAKE_LEGACY_CYGWIN_WIN32=1 instead.
 


I tried to do that to see if it fixed the error, but I'm not sure if I did it right. I added the line

   CMAKE_LEGACY_CYGWIN_WIN32=1

to CMakeCache.txt, then went into ccmake, [c], [g]. I looked at CMakeCache.txt again to see if the value is still there. It moved to a different area of the file and changed to


   CMAKE_LEGACY_CYGWIN_WIN32:UNINITIALIZED=1


I don't know if that's the right type, uninitialized. An attempt to make ParaView gives the same error as before.

I would really appreciate any help. Thank you.

ParaView doesn't support building with cygwin. Plus you don't need
cygwin for shared libs. I'm sure the plugin will build just fine with
VS. You just need to set the BUILD_SHARED_LIBS cmake variable to true
when building ParaView.

That's strange. And you say single pvserver works fine. BTW, 10.7
doesn't include MPI anymore. Did you install it yourself? What
version/variant did you use?

Thanks John.
I don't mind, just that I have reproduce hundreds of gygabytes in vtu
format. :-)
I learn patience I guess.

I'm trying to build Paraview with VS 2010 now, and it builds no problem - but it's not including Qt dll's. If I go to Project> Properties> Configuration Properties> VC++ Environment Variables, then the Qt bin directory appears in the long list in PATH. But once it builds, when I go to run paraview.exe, it says "The program can't start because QtGui4.dll is missing from your computer. Try reinstalling the program to fix this program." - even though QtGui4.dll is in the Qt bin folder. Ideas?

Subject: [Paraview] Saving PNL image (no screenshot)
Message-ID: <6178AAED582F704B93E101F34D2A4B400D99D2C8@dew153a.FEV.COM>

Hi,

I wrote a python-script for Paraview 3.14 which saves a Screenshot. I would like to run this script in the background but unfortunately writeImage won't save any updated picture because the window lost focus. Is there any function to save a picture form the actual view with the window in the background?

best regards

Max

Subject: [Paraview] mapping PipelineSource with vtkActor names solution
Message-ID: <1548748536.20120420115320@acm.org>

Regarding  resolving  meaningful actor  names  in  3D  views, I'd like to propose
adding a 1-line addition to:

ParaViewCore/ClientServerCore/vtkGeometryRepresentation.h  line 185:

    vtkPVLODActor* GetActor(){return Actor;}

This will give plugin developers the minimum required handle to
make  the  name  mapping  work. Why do we need it? To capture pipeline
filter  names  for  external  scenegraph  systems,  such as PDF3D, VRML, etc.
This change is already tested and working in the lab.

Further Details are recorded in:
  http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=13087
  including sample code on how this change can be used.

Subject: [Paraview] PV 3.14.1 little endian client / big endian server?
Message-ID: <20120420.204013.17263822.oshima@eng.niigata-u.ac.jp>

Hi,

I wonder if anyone has got PV 3.14.1 working with a little endian
client / big endian server setup? I am trying to run PV with the
client-server setup

Client:
Mac OS X 10.6.8 (Intel)
PV 3.14.1 OS X 64-bit binary downloaded from Kitware

Server:
Fujitsu FX10 (SPARC IXfx)
PV 3.14.1 cross-compiled on x86-64 Linux with CMake 2.8.7, FCCpx compiler

and am getting crashes both on the server and the client as
follows. There are other possible causes e.g. a bit tricky network
connection (using portfwd) but I am curious if PV is supposed to work
with this type of setup in the first place.

Server error messages:

I'm pretty sure it won't work since we started using protobuf
(ParaView 3.12). Mind reporting a bug? I would like to figure out if
there's an easy way to bring the support back.

Berk,

Could you spare a minute to let me know what changes you are making.  I don't see how you can the interface more usable, since it is already great :)
[My own copies has changed quite a bit (I need to finish the temporal rework of the pipeline as well, everything is broken at the moment - and the modular changes will make things much worse - I only have stuff for the old VTK, not the modular version. Will everything be horribly broken when I switch to the modular version)]

Leo and I will have an answer for you guys soon. FYI we just started working on the particle tracker with the purpose of cleaning it up as well as making its interface easier to use.

Hi Burlen,

I am hoping that Utkarsh could help figure things out.
If you elaborate more on what you do and what happens, I could at least share my experience.
I use *.vtr type files to generate particle trace and pathlines.
The problem I have/had is that as soon as I apply any Temporal Filter to the *.vtr file series, it either gives me error message or crashes.
I was very very very lucky that I found out that for the same dataset, if I use *.vtu format, no problems or crashing occurred. So, for now, I just used a Clip filter to extract my data into a *.vtu format and rewrite them, re-read them and do the ParticleTrace and ParticlePathlines.
That was my experience.

Let me know if I could be of any help.
Good luck,
Mohamad

Hi Mohamad,

I've been quietly following this thread in hopes that your interest in particle tracing will spark a response from the developers. I was unable to generate pathlines in image data in vti format I beleive I was using 3.10.0 at the time. It was not clear to me if there was a bug or if I had the pipeline built incorrectly out of my own ignorance on how this works in PV. I posted a question with test data hoping for some advise, http://paraview.markmail.org/message/ek67niwr7xagaajz?q=burlen+order:date-backward&page=15 however I did not receive any reply.

Hi all,

This is what I doing:

1- Load the PVD file (which holds the real time information associated with each *.vtr file)

<?xml version="1.0"?>
 <VTKFile type="Collection" version="0.1" byte_order="LittleEndian" compressor="vtkZLibDataCompressor">
   <Collection>
    <DataSet timestep="0.0" group="" part="0" file="vel_vec_0.vtr"/>
    <DataSet timestep="0.2" group="" part="0" file="vel_vec_1.vtr"/>
    <DataSet timestep="0.4" group="" part="0" file="vel_vec_2.vtr"/>
    <DataSet timestep="0.6" group="" part="0" file="vel_vec_3.vtr"/>
    <DataSet timestep="0.8" group="" part="0" file="vel_vec_4.vtr"/>
    <DataSet timestep="1.0" group="" part="0" file="vel_vec_5.vtr"/>
    <DataSet timestep="1.2" group="" part="0" file="vel_vec_6.vtr"/>
    <DataSet timestep="1.4" group="" part="0" file="vel_vec_7.vtr"/>
    <DataSet timestep="1.6" group="" part="0" file="vel_vec_8.vtr"/>
    <DataSet timestep="1.8" group="" part="0" file="vel_vec_9.vtr"/>
    <DataSet timestep="2.0" group="" part="0" file="vel_vec_10.vtr"/>
  </Collection>
</VTKFile>


2- Click on my data and create a "Temporal Cache" with "Cache Size=2".

3- From "Sources", I create a "Line".

4- Click on TemporalCache1 and create a ParticleTracer.
     When the menu pops up, I choose
             a) Input: TemporalCache1
             b) Source: Line1
     Right after I click Ok, this is the message I get (note that this message is shown even before giving me the chance to change any flags on the "Properties" section related to the "ParticleTracer1".

/home/utkarsh/Kitware/superbuild/paraview/src/paraview/VTK/Filtering/vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline.cxx, line 934

vtkPVPostFilterExecutive (0x4db4870): No maximum number of pieces has been set in the information for output port 0 on algorithm vtkPVPostFilter(0x4777fd0).

Luckily, Paraview does not crash and I can continue.
After doing some research, I am guessing that this has something to do with the time conflicts (Pipeline fed into the filter and the animation viewer time).

Observation: Right after I create the ParticleTracer and receive the error message, the time shown in the animation viewer is increased from "0.0" to "0.2". Why?

5- Recommended by the powerpoint, I set
         a) Time Step: True (1)
         b) Ignore Pipeline Time: True (1)


6- Now, I use "Animation View" as directed by the same powerpoint to feed the time into the ParticleTracer1 filter.
         a) Mode: Sequence
         b) Create a keyframe for "ParticleTracer1". Double click on the bar and set:
                   1: time: 0.2, (interpolation ramp), value: 1
                   2: time: 1.8, (), value: 9

Note: I have varied all the combinations listed above to include/exclude the last/first steps. No luck! Nothing really happening.

7- Play animation. Result: nothing happening? What is going on?


Observation: Using Paraview 3.8, I could see the animation without adjusting any parameters in the "Animation View" menu. Just the annoying error message was shown. However, I could do the same thing with Paraview 3.14, but it crashes after a few timesteps.

Anybody could share some hints on how to go about this?

Thanks,
Mohanad

Welcome to the magical world of Windows!!! You have to have the dlls
in the systems dirs or your PATH environment variable. Set the PATH to
include the path to Qt dlls before starting ParaView.

How do I do that? I tried putting QtGui4.dll in System32 folder and I also tried setting Project> Properties> Debugging> Environment to the Qt bin directory (and Merge Environment = Yes), but I'm still getting the same error, so I guess that's not what you meant.

 

Also, what do you mean about setting PATH /before/ starting Paraview? If the PV project isn't open, Project> Properties is greyed out - but once the PV project opens, I don't have to do anything to add Qt bin directory to PATH, it's already there.

 

Thank you.

I won't be able to help you with how to set the paths up from the VS
IDE, some other Windows developers may want to help you there. Here's
what I do to setup evironment correctly before lauching the
paraview.exe

* Start the VS COmmand Prompt

* do the following to extend the PATH

  set PATH=<Location of all Qt dlls>;%PATH%

*  cd <Location of paraview.exe>

* Now run the paraview.exe from the command prompt itself.

  paraview.exe

To setup environment globally, look at:

Celia,

Please see http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms173406.aspx on
how to edit the environment in Visual Studio 10. Set the environment
to

PATH=<path to your Qt DLL directory>

You don't necessarily need the %PATH% part Utkarsh referred to.

Then you can run ParaView from within Visual Studio.

Hope that helps,
Cory

Hi Utkarsh,

It turned out that the 10.7 machine had mpi installed in /usr/local.
After installing openmpi 1.4.5 on both machines (10.6 and 10.7),
the pvserver is running on both and paraview is able to connect.

Subject: [Paraview] set paraview camera to a real camera intrinsic matrix
Message-ID: <CAHa6DTH5O8UfiH1csgeFxY-GWX7ggwDSDiTuP5VkFU8Y5gstsw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I am trying to augment an image from a real camera to a VR world.
I came into a problem try to configure the paraview camera to the real
camera.

I know that setting camera position, view-up direction and focal point,
will give me the correct extrinsics of the camera (i.e. orientation and
displacement of the camera in the world coordinate system), but I am now
stuck at setting the intrinsics: for example my camera center is not at the
image center, therefore, by just setting up the extrinsics does not give me
the correct rendering view I need.

Is there a standard way to set up the camera so that I get correct
intrinsics?

Let's say we have K R t for my real camera, the image resolution is
[640,480]:

K = [1500       0 310
             0 1400 230
             0      0     1]

R = [1 0 0
       0 1 0
       0 0 1]

t = [0 0 0]';

Many thanks!

Li

Subject: [Paraview] Color map removed in ParaView 3.14, please put back later
Message-ID: <4f919602.c42eec0a.201e.23a5@mx.google.com>

Thank you for supporting ParaView!  It is an excellent tool for 
teaching, for research, and we've found it to be a good platform for research.

I notice that the only isoluminant color map (CIELab blue to red) has 
been removed from the list of available color maps, replaced with yet 
more variations on the rainbow color map (for a total of five).

I won't take the opportunity to repeat the reasons that there is 
always a better color map than rainbow 
(http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=4118486&tag=1 
lays this out for the umpteenth time), but I would like to request 
that the CIELAB one be put back.

When I want to map onto a surface and therefore need an isoluminant 
map, I find myself (and the students in my class) having to construct 
it myself each time.  This is about half the time I use 
Paraview.  For the other half, I use the Blackbody radiation 
spectrum, which is still there.

My guess is that it was removed accidentally when the new ones were added.

Until we add it back in, attached is the LUT in question which I've
just exported from 3.12.
In PV 3.14, go to the color scale editor, choose preset and import it
to get it back in your copy.

Please how can a I fill holes in my Polydata.  I worked through the
vtkHoleFillFilter documentation and tried to create ParaView plugin to fill

me if this question has been answered because I am still new using VTK.
Here is my code:

Subject: [Paraview] error: RegionIDs cannot be 0
Message-ID: <8B8EA120-5B30-40DD-BA88-3EF17A9A8A31@gmail.com>

Hello Paraviewers,

(sorry for this long email but I wanted to give some pieces of code and the different things I tried before using the mailing list)

I have a 3D field of a vector and I would like to create different renderings at different parts of it. So, I play with ExctractSubset, Programmable filters and Calculators to build my viz. I do this with some python scripts and pvbatch.

Here is the pipeline I created:
XDMFReader
l
l--ExctractSubset1
l                l---------------Calculator1--- Volume rendering        
l--ExctractSubset2
                 l---------------Calculator2
                                             l-------------Programable filter---- Volume rendering

where I use ExctractSubset to cut my domain into two parts, Calculator to compute the magnitude of its input and the Programmable filter to set the value of some region of its input to zero (kind of mask for my VR).
 

I get the following message when I do the last Render() ( and then WriteImage()):

ERROR: In /home/ucl/tfl/sbackaer/local/build/ParaView/ParaViewCore/VTKExtensions/vtkKdTreeGenerator.cxx, line 168
vtkKdTreeGenerator (0x1229df20): RegionIDs cannot be 0.
 
(one per core)

and then a Seg fault

If I try to apply the volume rendering on the Calculator2 output instead of Prog filter, but still with it in the pipe, everything works.
I checked that the programmable filter produces a correct output with GetPointDataInformation(): in both cases, same object and correct values like range, bounds, extents...

Here is the part of my code that should be the source of my problem: if I change DataRepresentation6 = Show(pfilter) to DataRepresentation6 = Show(Ucalc) and correct field name below, it works... (sub2 is the output of a ExtractSubset)

but no seg fault and the image is correct!




I checked every output of the different pipelines with GetDataInformation(), GetPointDataInformation()... all outputs were right.

My first problem is basically that I do not know what "RegionID cannot be 0" means!

The problem is related somehow to the Volume Rendering...

I get the same issue and same messages with the two different versions 3.12 and 3.14.

Does anyone have any clue? I am a bit lost!
I can provide the results of GetDataInformation(), GetPointDataInformation(), give my complete codes or try anything else...

Best,

Stephane

Subject: [Paraview]  To create a snapshot from a given datafile and state,
 how to change the datafile filename of the state?
Message-ID: <CA+8Z1WjDzFwXu-FTcQDBmts7m235ibtnspDB07zWy5L8Wjjg4w@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,
I am currently able to visualize correctly in ParaView a .vtp file for each
time step of a simulation, and to print a screenshot for each. I want to do
that in batch, but I want to keep the same state for each one (view point,
filters applied, etc). I Have already saved the state into a .psvm file ,
and I tried to write a python script which, after being run by pvbatch,
will (hopefully) print the screenshots. But, unfortunately, it is not
working. I tried to change the filename in the state by processing search
and replace, but still is not working. For instance, it keeps working on
the first data input only. I use ParaView 3.14.0 in Snow Leopard. The
reader stuff (commented) is giving me errors. I am sure this is easy, but I
am overwhelmed with the large amount of info about python and paraview with
no reference to this issue. Please, please, any advice is greatly welcome,
and I am sorry if this has been answered previously (I looked at google and
the mailing list). Below is my script, which can also be found at
http://pastebin.com/UkDAcnHE .

#!/bin/python
import glob, string, os, commands
from paraview.simple import *

#help(servermanager)
# vtp files are inside the local subdir DISPLAY
files = (commands.getoutput("ls DISPLAY/data-*.vtp | grep -v
contacts")).split()

# process each file
for filename in files:
    fullfn = commands.getoutput("ls $PWD/" + filename).replace('/','\/')
    fn = filename.replace('DISPLAY/', '')
    #os.system("cp ../dem_git/addons/paraview_state.pvsm tmp.pvsm")
    os.system("cp ~/Desktop/state.pvsm tmp.pvsm")
    os.system("sed -i.bck 's/DATA.vtp/" + fullfn + "/1' tmp.pvsm") #

    pm = servermanager.ProxyManager()
    #reader = pm.GetProxy("sources",fullfn)

Subject: [Paraview] Show coordinate position on a slice
Message-ID: <DE24C4FF-1294-4BB2-A68A-F1DF529A9DFF@gmail.com>

Hi all;
is there any way to show the position of a slice on screen? Let's say I have a slice with x-normal, I'd like to insert a text box that quotes the X at which the slice is done? I would need that when I save an animation as a sweep of slices through a domain?

Thank you

Lorenzo

Message-ID: <69E15DA4-BC73-4102-9A3F-EC31871FD27A@mac.com>

Hi all,


I succeeded to build ParaView on CentOS 6.2,
and I had another Linux Workstation of CentOS 5.3.
So I built ParaView 3.14.1 on CentOS 5.3,
but I got some troubles to execute ParaView.

I installed those packages by yum command:
> libXext-devel.x86_64
> dbus-devel.x86_64
> libXext-devel.x86_64
> glib2-devel.x86_64
> gstreamer-devel.x86_64
> gstreamer-plugins-base-devel.x86_64
> gtk2-devel.x86_64
> libXt-devel.x86_64
And I built Python 2.7.2 (as Shared Library), cmake 2.8.7
and Qt 4.6.4 from sources.

Then I built ParaView, it seemed to be installed successfully.
But when I execute ParaView, I got an error as below:
> /usr/local/lib/paraview-3.14/paraview: error while loading
> shared libraries: libQtHelp.so.4: cannot open shared object
> file: No such file or directory

So I made symbolic link as below:
> ln -s /usr/local/lib/libQtHelp.so.4 /lib64/libQtHelp.so.4

But I got another error:
> /usr/local/lib/paraview-3.14/paraview: error while loading
> shared libraries: libQtHelp.so.4: cannot open shared object
> file: Error 40

How could I solve these problems?

Hi Li,

Looks like you may want to set the projection matrix with the intrinsic
values. The pv / vtkCamera does not provide an API to do that but there is
nothing stopping you from exposing it in your copy of the source.

Message-ID: <CA+8Z1WgQksNXBBU15BDK167YqtVaH1bhf6XHnbCNWiXjKgbitg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,
I have created  a custom filter from the gui paraview interface. How can I
make it available for batch processing? Although I have added it to the gui
Paraview interface, it does not appears after doing something like
dir(servermanager.filters) in pvpython . Furthermore, I want to process the
data in servers where I have no gui access, so a standard pvpython way to
add a custom filter (where to put it to make it available) will be very
useful. Thanks in advance.

Best regards / Cordialmente,

William-Fernando Oquendo

You can do that using a python script/macro (not Python Programmable
filter). Have you given that a try?

No, I haven't? I hoped there was an "easier" way? I'll give that a try then.

Thank you!

Try running ParaView as:

> LD_DEBUG=libs ./bin/paraview

~/Kitware/ParaView3/ParaViewBin

Pipe the output to a file and look at the output. It should tell you where
it's looking for the QtHelp.

Since vtkFillHolesFilter is an existing VTK filter, I believe you can
use an XML-only method to make this into a plugin:

Hi Utkarsh,


Thanks for your Advices.
I tried to do LD_DEBUG, and 2 different results are found.

If I did it for ./ParaView_bin/paraview (built by "make"):

Then I also did it for /usr/local/bin/paraview (installed by "make install"):

I hope ParaView could run on /usr/local/bin by all users of my machine.

I wouldn't go about loading the state again and again merely to change
the filename, instead change the filename directly on the reader
proxy.

Use GetSources() to get a map of all the sources in the state. Looking
at the names, you should be able to figure out what's the reader
proxy. Then you can change the FileName on it.

Hi ,

I am pretty new to Paraview but I have been playing with Paraview quite a bit recently. But the bulk of my time has been spent trying to get my data into a form that Paraview will accept. I chose *.vtk ( unstructured grid legacy VTK format).

So basically what I am working on is Segmentation of Volumetric CT data from X-ray scans .i.e  we  develop algorithms to pull out objects from CT data. So I'd like to view the volume rendered ( and sometimes concurrently view the slice data) CT data of the bag. Then I would also like to bring in the segmented objects(output from our algorithms) and overlay them on top of the CT data in Paraview. I would like to have a different color for each object. So here's how far I have got


1.       I can bring in the CT data ( as *.vtk ) and volume render it. It's looks good.

2.       I can then bring in a segmented object ( another  *.vtk file) and view it with the CT data to evaluate how well I did.



What I need to know how to do.

1.       Will Paraview allow me to specify a differ color bar for the CT data ( I'd like to use one of the presets - X-ray) and  the segmented objects after the data has been loaded into Paraview? OR do I have to specify a "Look UP table" in my VTK files? Currently I am just using the "Default" keyword.

2.       Is there a way to have one file for the CT data and all the segmented objects? I will be segmenting a large number of object s from the data and loading them into Paraview one at a time would not be efficient. If there is such a file, will Paraview allow me to view/un-view each object separately?

3.        I am currently running Paraview on my desktop (windows 7) which has a pretty good processor and 16GB of RAM. I store the CT data as a structured point VTK file and the segmented objects as unstructured grid VTK files. Some of the CT data sets are pretty large on the order of 512x512x1000 points. The volume rendering is not instantaneous when I rotate the object. Is this expected ? And if so , is the delay because of the processor, the RAM or the graphics card? Also, the rendering for the unstructured grid VTK is even slower.  I would think this is expected given the delay for the structured grid - I would think Paraview has to work harder because of the unstructured nature of the points. Correct? Is there a more optimal way to present my data to Paraview?



Thanks!

Karina

ParaView will allow you to pick LUTs for the CT data and the segments
both of which you're reading from the vtk files. ParaView likes to
share lookup tables when the scalar arrays have the same name. If you
run into that situation, you can rename the scalar arrays either in
the VTK files or using  the Calculator filter. (I can give you details
if it comes to that). ParaView does not respect LUTs specified in the
VTK files so "DEfault" is just as good as any other in this case.

I am guessing the segmented objects are polygonal (vtkPolyData), in
which case you can easily use the "vtm" format to group the files into
a sequence of blocks in a Multi-Block dataset. This preserves the
information about individual segments as well. YOu can then apply the
"Extract Block" filter to select/un-select the blocks you don't want
to be seen. This functionality is expected to be improved in future so
that you don't have to use the "Extract Block" filter at all.

What version of ParaView are you using? 3.14 has "smarts" in there to
pick the fastest volume renderer. ParaView should switch to "cheaper"
rendering mode as you interact. Is the delay something that you see
intially and goes away as you keep on moving the mouse or is it
present for each movement of the mouse?

 Also, the rendering for the

Yes, unstructured will indeed be much slower. It also leads to lot of
memory bloat so it's generally not  a good idea to convert a
structure-data to unstructured grid unless warranted.

Hi Utkarsh,

Thanks for your responses. I have some follow-up questions. Please see below...

Karina,

<Karina> Ok great. I think for my test cases, I have the scalar name the same for the CT data and the all the segments. I can easily fix this. And then you are saying I should be able to use the "LUT Editor" in Paraview individually for each of my files(*.vtk) after loading them in manually, right?

<Karina> Well, currently I was using "Unstructured Grid" for the segments. Can I use *.vtm to group a bunch of "unstructured grid" blocks of data? If yes, is there some advantage of using "Polydata" instead of "unstructured grid" for the segments? If you cannot group "unstructured grid" blocks then I guess I can use "PolyData" instead.  
Ok the *.vtm format seems like what I need though I will need some time to digest to construct them. So if load my *.vtm file into Paraview, is there a quick way to select a different LUTs for each segment? OR will I have to manually extract each block and select a LUT? I can see how this might get cumbersome as the number of segments increase. I was actually hoping I could somehow specify the LUT in the vtk file. But you said earlier this is not recognized in Paraview, right? Any thoughts?

rendering mode as you interact. Is the delay something that you see intially and goes away as you keep on moving the mouse or is it present for each movement of the mouse?

<Karina> I am using v3.14.0. For the unstructured grid data , the volume rendering displays almost like a surface rendering while I am moving the mouse. And then there is a delay one I have settled on a position ( not pressing the  left-button on the mouse") and then I see the volume rendering.

 Also, the rendering for the

Karina,

> ...And then you are saying I should be able to use the "LUT Editor" in Paraview individually for each of my files(*.vtk) after loading them in manually, right?

Yes. Also, is the scalar for each segment constant for that segment?
In that case you may want to name the scalar using the same name for
all the segments but give each one a different scalar value. Then when
you load it, you can color all segments using the same scalar array
but specify a LUT that spans the range for scalar values provided by
all segments.


> Can I use *.vtm to group a bunch of "unstructured grid" blocks of data? If yes, is there some advantage of using "Polydata" instead of "unstructured grid" for the segments?

Unstructured is just fine. vtm can support blocks comprising of
unstructured datasets. Note that vtm requires  the blocks to be
specified using the VTK-XML formats (and not legacy VTK) so you'll
have to write *.vtu files for your segments.

> So if load my *.vtm file into Paraview, is there a quick way to select a different LUTs for each segment? OR will I have to manually extract each block and select a LUT? I can see how this might get cumbersome as the number of segments increase.

Alas, that's what you have to --- extract each one to color it. But if
we're talking of a constant scalar for the entire segment, things
might get easier by the solution I suggested earlier.

> I was actually hoping I could somehow specify the LUT in the vtk file. But you said earlier this is not recognized in Paraview, right? Any thoughts?

Yup, ParaView won't respect LUTs in the vtk file. But you can specify
the color scalar (RGB) in the data directly. SImply create a scalar
array that's of the type unsigned-char with 3 components and the color
using that array. ParaView will still try to create a LUT by default,
but on the display tab, you should then be able to uncheck "Map
Scalars" and the colors specified in the data will be used directly. I
am not sure I've expressed it clearly here, so let me if it isn't
obvious.

> I am using v3.14.0. For the unstructured grid data , the volume rendering displays almost like a surface rendering while I am moving the mouse. And then there is a delay one I have settled on a position ( not pressing the ?left-button on the mouse") and then I see the volume rendering.

Ah! You're using unstructured grid volume rendering. Yes, that'd do
what you say. And here the delay is due to CPU. We only have CPU
volume renderers, if I am not mistaken. Again, if your data is a
structure data, I'd leave it as ImageData. It should perform much
better.

Thanks! Your responses have been very helpful. 
I will need a little bit of time to work on the LUT and file format suggestions you made. I might have more questions then. But I have a few things to try before that ..

Karina,

> ...And then you are saying I should be able to use the "LUT Editor" in Paraview individually for each of my files(*.vtk) after loading them in manually, right?

Yes. Also, is the scalar for each segment constant for that segment?
In that case you may want to name the scalar using the same name for all the segments but give each one a different scalar value. Then when you load it, you can color all segments using the same scalar array but specify a LUT that spans the range for scalar values provided by all segments.


> Can I use *.vtm to group a bunch of "unstructured grid" blocks of data? If yes, is there some advantage of using "Polydata" instead of "unstructured grid" for the segments?

Unstructured is just fine. vtm can support blocks comprising of unstructured datasets. Note that vtm requires  the blocks to be specified using the VTK-XML formats (and not legacy VTK) so you'll have to write *.vtu files for your segments.

> So if load my *.vtm file into Paraview, is there a quick way to select a different LUTs for each segment? OR will I have to manually extract each block and select a LUT? I can see how this might get cumbersome as the number of segments increase.

Alas, that's what you have to --- extract each one to color it. But if we're talking of a constant scalar for the entire segment, things might get easier by the solution I suggested earlier.

> I was actually hoping I could somehow specify the LUT in the vtk file. But you said earlier this is not recognized in Paraview, right? Any thoughts?

Yup, ParaView won't respect LUTs in the vtk file. But you can specify the color scalar (RGB) in the data directly. SImply create a scalar array that's of the type unsigned-char with 3 components and the color using that array. ParaView will still try to create a LUT by default, but on the display tab, you should then be able to uncheck "Map Scalars" and the colors specified in the data will be used directly. I am not sure I've expressed it clearly here, so let me if it isn't obvious.

> I am using v3.14.0. For the unstructured grid data , the volume rendering displays almost like a surface rendering while I am moving the mouse. And then there is a delay one I have settled on a position ( not pressing the ?left-button on the mouse") and then I see the volume rendering.

Ah! You're using unstructured grid volume rendering. Yes, that'd do what you say. And here the delay is due to CPU. We only have CPU volume renderers, if I am not mistaken. Again, if your data is a structure data, I'd leave it as ImageData. It should perform much better.

Looks like "/usr/local/lib" is not a default path where your CentOS
looks for loading libs. The ParaView from the binary dir works since
it uses rpaths for all libs and it has the rpath for the Qt libs too.
That gets removed on install and hence the issue. Try googling around,
there must be a way to extend your default lib search path.

Hi Mike and Utkarsh,

Was there a resolution to this problem?

I'm having a similar problem with a set of plugins failing to load
despite everything looking okay. The real oddness in my case is that
sometimes one plugin works and another fails, but when I recompile the
one that worked starts failing and another one works.

Initially I had all the source files and CMake commands in a single
directory and I thought that maybe some files were getting clobbered
by the CMake plugin magic. Putting each plugin in a separate
directory, however, didn't solve the problem.

Thanks,
Cory

I have some new information to add.

Sometimes, the files

<plugin>Init.cxx
<vtkClass>ClientServer.cxx
vtkSM<plugin>Instantiator.h
vtkSM<plugin>Instantiator.cxx
vtkSMXML_<plugin>.h

are generated, sometimes they are not. I haven't found a consistent
way to reproduce the behavior where these files are not generating.
Every time I compile, though, a dylib for the plugin (I'm on a Mac) is
generated. There are no complaints about not being able to find the
files I listed above when they are missing. Making clean and
rebuilding doesn't seem to help.

Thoughts or suggestions?

Thanks,
Cory

Until recently, there was a link on the ParaView download page to documentation on the configuration of each build (for example, what compiler used, versions of Qt, MPI, etc.).  I do not see that on the most recent download page.  Is this information still being maintained?

Message-ID: <1335366592.56251.YahooMailNeo@web160102.mail.bf1.yahoo.com>

Dear Paraview experts,

I completed a CFD calculations which contains, U (velocity field) and p (pressure field).? 
I used "extract selection" to select a cross section.? I then would like to calculate the flow rate through this cross section, ie, U dot A.? I tried to use the Calculator function.? I saw U in the vector field.? Is there a way to have A (area, vector field) so that I can do U dot A, then, integrate U dot A to have flow rate?

Thanks!

That is great. One request for more details though. I need to know the exact version of VS2008 for the Windows builds. Depending on the version of VS2008 a different set of C/C++ runtime lib/versions is used. My goal is I want to be able to build a plugin that I can host on my own web site and simply tell people to download ParaView from the ParaView website. If we don't exactly match VS2008 versions then the user will get "side-by-side" issues. Thanks

Use Generate Normals before the calculator and Integrate Variables after.

Also try the Surface Flow which I does all three operations at once.

Okay, I figured out the problem. I am have a code generator that
produces the VTK files. Currently, I have the dependencies set up so
that the VTK class code isn't generated until build time. The problem
is that the generation of the instantiators and init files don't get
generated by the CMake plugin magic because the header files for my
plugin classes don't exist at CMake configuration time.

The solution seems to be to generate the code at CMake configuration
time before any calls to add_paraview_plugin are made.

Subject: [Paraview] Color legend orientation
Message-ID: <9047EE0D4D3C8E43B93980DA10A073807C0DDCC3@EXMB04.srn.sandia.gov>

Is it possible to turn off the auto re-orientation of the color legend?  In other words, if I grab the color legend and drag it to the bottom of the screen, it changes to horizontal orientation.  Can I then move it back to the right side of the screen, leaving it horizontal?  I have a user that is trying to display numerous datasets on the same viewport, with a half dozen color legends displayed on the right side of the viewport, oriented horizontally.

Thanks,

Alan

I have updated the version for Visual studio for the binary packages.

It should be noted that this really is just the minimum version that is
needed to satisfy the dll requirements. If you have a newer msvcrt
installed in your SXS directory it will be chosen automatically by windows.

Hi, David,

Thanks for the reply!

I tried Generate Surface Normal first, then, did Integrate Variables.? I got values for "Surface Normal (vector)" "p (scalar)" "U (vector)" ...

It looks like integrate only sums up each parameter, so that, Surface Normal and U are still a vector.? It does not do U dot A.

I have also tried Surface Flow.? I got two values for Surface Flow, something like [-3.64248e-6 -3.64248e-6].? Shouldn't it be just one value?

Pei-Ying

Use Generate Normals before the calculator and Integrate Variables after.

Also try the Surface Flow which I does all three operations at once.

You still need the calculator filter to compute the dot product.

data->normals->calculator->integrate

Those two are the same value. It is an artifact of the fact that the
information tab typically shows characteristics of whole arrays. In
this case you have an array with just one element. Show the output of
the filter in the spreadsheet view instead.

Hi,

My problem is : In last few days, the start of PV is very slow (more than 5

Subject: [Paraview]  PV 3.14.1 crashes when disconnecting a dataset
Message-ID: <4F995A5B.6080501@onera.fr>

Hello.

Sometimes, when I disconnect a dataset to load another one from a new 
state file, PV 3.14.1 crashes. This does not happen with all my 
datasets, but only with large datasets that were loaded with a state 
file having a very complex pipeline, so I cannot give an example.

This is not really blocking, but just annoying as I have to restart PV 
each time I want to change my dataset.

Has anyone experienced this problem ?

Best regards.

This maybe related to the discussion in this thread:

If it's indeed the same, then I've attached a patch that fixes the
issue. It has been committed to git-master.

Subject: [Paraview] PV 3.14.1 crashes when disconnecting a dataset

Thank you for this info, Utkarsh.

Maybe your are right, my problem could be related to this discussion. 
But I have never tried to load a state file AFTER having added some 
source or other data in the pipeline. When I load a state file, it is 
always on an empty pipeline, and I never got PV crash when loading a 
state file on an empty pipeline, even if it is a complex state file. The 
problem appears only when I want to disconnect to get the pipeline 
empty: PV may crash or not, depending on the complexity of the current 
pipeline.

I will take a look at the next binaries release to see if my problem is 
solved with your patch.

Best regards.

Can you also add a link to that page back on the ParaView download page?
That's where I always go to look for it.

Hmm ok. Well, keep us posted if any additional insights come about
that could help reproduce/debug this issue.

Looks like it's there already. On

You still need the calculator filter to compute the dot product.

data->normals->calculator->integrate

Those two are the same value. It is an artifact of the fact that the
information tab typically shows characteristics of whole arrays. In
this case you have an array with just one element. Show the output of
the filter in the spreadsheet view instead.

Try running without the configuration files.  You can find out how to delete them here: http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView_Settings_Files.  The other option is to run ParaView -dr, which runs ParaView without using the configuration files.

I delete the init file of PV and now it works well.

I don't know if this is related, but I just found a crash when
shutting down ParaView. I'm running in Debug mode under Visual Studio
2008 64-bit and I have commit 0f43430ddb988dbb05b8c3ff4bf414dc79608c4a
checked out. When I run ParaView and close it immediately without
doing anything, I get a crash in pqProxy::clearHelperProxies() (lines
170-171)

  if ( this->getServer() && this->getServer()->session() &&
       !this->getServer()->session()->IsMultiClients())

The NULL check for this->getServer()->session() succeeds because
session returns a pointer with the address 0xfeeefeeefeeefeee which in
Debug mode means it has been deleted.

That too has been fixed on git-next. It went into master following
last week's gatekeeper review.

I am not too sure I follow exactly the steps that you are doing. Can you
share the data as well as the sequence of actions that leads to the errors,
please? Also, what version of PAraView are you using?

Thanks

Subject: [Paraview] VisitBridge - GMV Reader
Message-ID: <4F996EC7.CD12.00C2.0@NETL.DOE.GOV>

I have ported the GMV reader from VisIt into ParaView using the VisitBridge.  It works properly for a single time step.  However it will not support my transient data.  GMV's file format has a file per timestep.  Is there something I need to do to the reader to enable this feature?
 
Thanks in advance.

Hello, Utkarsh.

I made further tests with the sate file that makes PV 3.14.1 crash when 
disconnecting the dataset.

I launch PV 3.14.1 in command line, and when I disconnect the dataset, 
it crashes with this short message : "segmentation fault"

This state file has been written by PV 3.14.1 and I tried also to read 
it with PV 3.12: it just complains about some missing new feature of PV 
3.14 (group layout) , but it works, and it does not crash when 
disconnecting the dataset.

If it may help you, I could send the state file, but not the dataset 
which is confidential.

Best regards.

Richard

Subject: [Paraview] error: RegionIDs cannot be 0
Message-ID: <B81B35EE-3E90-41DE-8184-7310037FF8E9@gmail.com>

Hello Paraviewers,

(sorry for this long email but I wanted to give some pieces of code and the different things I tried before using the mailing list)

I have a 3D field of a vector and I would like to create different renderings at different parts of it. So, I play with ExctractSubset, Programmable filters and Calculators to build my viz. I do this with some python scripts and pvbatch.

Here is the pipeline I created:
XDMFReader
l
l--ExctractSubset1
l                l---------------Calculator1--- Volume rendering        
l--ExctractSubset2
                l---------------Calculator2
                                            l-------------Programable filter---- Volume rendering

where I use ExctractSubset to cut my domain into two parts, Calculator to compute the magnitude of its input and the Programmable filter to set the value of some region of its input to zero (kind of mask for my VR).


I get the following message when I do the last Render() ( and then WriteImage()):

ERROR: In /home/ucl/tfl/sbackaer/local/build/ParaView/ParaViewCore/VTKExtensions/vtkKdTreeGenerator.cxx, line 168
vtkKdTreeGenerator (0x1229df20): RegionIDs cannot be 0.

(one per core)

and then a Seg fault

If I try to apply the volume rendering on the Calculator2 output instead of Prog filter, but still with it in the pipe, everything works.
I checked that the programmable filter produces a correct output with GetPointDataInformation(): in both cases, same object and correct values like range, bounds, extents...

Here is the part of my code that should be the source of my problem: if I change DataRepresentation6 = Show(pfilter) to DataRepresentation6 = Show(Ucalc) and correct field name below, it works... (sub2 is the output of a ExtractSubset)

but no seg fault and the image is correct!




I checked every output of the different pipelines with GetDataInformation(), GetPointDataInformation()... all outputs were right.

My first problem is basically that I do not know what "RegionID cannot be 0" means!

The problem is related somehow to the Volume Rendering...

I get the same issue and same messages with the two different versions 3.12 and 3.14.

Does anyone have any clue? I am a bit lost!
I can provide the results of GetDataInformation(), GetPointDataInformation(), give my complete codes or try anything else...

Best,

Stephane

Hi,

I'm a big fan of Paraview, but I am lacking the feature to visualize 
arbitrary order elements (more than 2). After some searches, I did not 
find any suitable solution (I currently split the elements into my 
code). Is anyone aware on a plugin doing that, or should I start writing 
one?

Thanks,
S?bastien

Utkarsh,

I send the gzipped state file. I did not know if it could be used 
without the dataset.

This is the state file that has been built by PV 3.14.1 and that makes 
it crash when disconnecting the dataset.

Have a good week-end.

Richard.

Hi Terry,

Make sure the VISIT_READER_TYPE in your CMakeLists is either STMD or MTMD.
Secondly we expect the reader to return the correct number of of time steps
or cycles when we call GetCycles or GetTimes. If this isn't how your reader
behaves can you explain
to me where you are storing the time and cycle information and I will add a
bug report.

Thanks for the reply.
 
It uses vtkAvtSTMDFileFormatAlgorithm.  As for the number of cycles that is not known by the file format or the user.  Each time step is an individual file, similar to how the vtu file series behaves.  In the file open dialog ParaView picks up all the files and groups them as a series.  However when I try to animate using "snap to timesteps" (or either of the two animations options), it doesn't animate.
 
Also I am implementing this reader using the VisitBridge.  I see no entries in the vtkVisitGMVReader.h or cxx (which is generated I believe from the Visit avt file) of the function GetTimes().

Message-ID: <CAGA9z8fnrT_Z9rhjgQaAyy4GC35p4zhF-KHP58T-RLUCkAqc+g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone

I have applyed the contour filter on a dataset with isosurface Temp and I
want to calculate the gradient of a variable Temp on the combustion dataset
and use the magnitude of the gradient as a color map for the Temp isosurface

how can I do that ?


Thanks

This is an oversight on my part. Can you please submit a bug that STMD
files don't support file series properly.

Apply the gradient filter first to make the temp gradient field, then
contour the output of that but choose the original temp field as the
one to contour. Finally choose the gradient field magnitude as the
value to color the isosurface by.

Can you explain me how can I apply the gradient filter using python


this is my code

from paraview import servermanager
from paraview.simple import*
connection = servermanager.Connect()
reader.FileName ="/Users/........../disk_out_
ref.ex2"

reader.UpdatePipeline()
pointData = servermanager.filters.CellDataToPointData(Input=reader)
pointData.UpdatePipeline()

gradData = servermanager.filters.CellDataToPointData(Input=reader)
servermanager.filters.Contour.ContourBy = True
servermanager.filters.Contour.Isosurfaces = True

contourData = servermanager.filters.Contour(Input=pointData)
contourData.ContourBy = 'Temp'
contourData.Isosurfaces = [400]
contourData.UpdatePipeline()


servermanager.filters.DecimatePro.TargetReduction = True
dec = servermanager.filters.DecimatePro(Input=contourData)
dec.TargetReduction = 0.9
dec.UpdatePipeline()

view = servermanager.CreateRenderView()
Show(dec, view)
Render(view)


Thanks

The easiest solution will be to expand the visit_readers.xml file to have a
second base visit reader base class. This
second base class would be a file series reader and would be used for all
single time database readers.

Dear All paraview user,

This is Tomohisa Shimoyama from Hiroshima university ,Japan.
I am new user of paraview, and it is nice to meet you.

I am trying to simulate tsunami propagation in Seto Inland Sea, Japan.
I would like to draw 3D animation by paraview.
However,in my research case, horizontal distance is so much longer than
vertical distance.
So far, I could confirm as if my picture were 2D.
Therefore, does someone know how to change ration between horizontal and
vertical?


When i make a presentation, I would like to display clearly 3D picture.
If someone knows it's method, please let me know?



Sincerely,

Shimoyama Tomohisa

Hi Shimoyama,

I did not quite understand your question.
If you like to show a movie of the 3-dimensional evolution of the your flow
field, you could move the camera and follow some region, say the front of
your current.

Cheers,
Mohamad

Maybe a warp filter could do the job...

Message-ID: <CA+uC0Hqc3dwNN=6Ma=1sC2YACv_WeRpo07623qL7CMckfjkNmA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

This, I think should work:

------------------
from paraview.simple import *

# Create a view
view = CreateRenderView()

# Initialize a new interactor
from vtk.libvtkRenderingPython import *
iren = vtkRenderWindowInteractor()
iren.SetInteractorStyle(vtkInteractorStyleTrackball())
iren.SetRenderWindow(view.GetRenderWindow())
iren.Initialize()

# Build pipeline
Sphere()
Show()
Render()

# Start interaction
iren.Start()
----------------

I'm using the latest ubuntu 12.04 so I suspect maybe this isnt too
good... Anyway, when I run the code I get:

-----
$ python test.py
Traceback (most recent call last):
   File "test.py", line 7, in <module>
     from vtk.libvtkRenderingPython import *
ImportError: No module named libvtkRenderingPython
-----

I then read that maybe I should better use "pvpython", this gives:

--
$ pvpython test.py
Error converting executable file "/usr/bin/../lib/paraview/pvpython" to
real path: No such file or directory
--


Sorry, I don't have much experience with this. It's a noob question, I
know. I hope somebody knows the answer/solution. Thank you very much -
I've been struggling with this (and making simple paraview python
scripts) for about 10 hours. No I have to ask you guys...

Hi Utkarsh,


I had been trying to solve libQtHelp errors.
Finally I succeeded to run my ParaView.

I missed two important settings.
First one was about Qt.
Qt 4.6.2 was pre-installed on CentOS 6.2 and I additionally
installed Qt 4.6.4 from tarball, so both versions of Qt were
mixed on my CMake setting.
My old ParaView on CentOS 6.2 looked no problem, but it referred
pre-installed Qt 4.6.2.
On the other hand, CentOS 5.3's Qt was 3.3, so it couldn't be
referred from ParaView (it was already built with Qt 4.6.4).
When I changed QT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE as /usr/local/bin/qmake from
/usr/bin/qmake-qt4 (pre-installed qmake) and re-configured
on CentOS 6.2, all Qt settings were updated.

Second one was about LD_LIBRARY_PATH as you mensioned.
My ParaView (built with Qt 4.6.4) still dumped libQtHelp errors.
If I did "export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib", my ParaView ran.
And also I modified /etc/ld.so.conf, they ran too.

Thanks for your advices!!

pvpython issue needs to be investigated.

Hi Anton,

Thanks for the suggestion.
--------
from paraview.simple import *
from vtk.vtkRenderingPython import * # <===== NEW LINE
#from vtk.libvtkRenderingPython import *

# Create a view
view = CreateRenderView()

# Initialize a new interactor
iren = vtkRenderWindowInteractor()
iren.SetInteractorStyle(vtkInteractorStyleTrackball())
iren.SetRenderWindow(view.GetRenderWindow())
iren.Initialize()

# Build pipeline
Sphere()
Show()
Render()

# Start interaction
iren.Start()
--------

Gives:
----
$ python test.py
Warning: In 
/build/buildd/vtk-5.8.0/Rendering/vtkInteractorStyleTrackball.cxx, line 29
vtkInteractorStyleTrackball (0x3798210): vtkInteractorStyleTrackball 
will be deprecated in
the next release after VTK 4.0. Please use
vtkInteractorStyleSwitch instead.

Traceback (most recent call last):
   File "test.py", line 11, in <module>
     iren.SetRenderWindow(view.GetRenderWindow())
TypeError: argument 1: method requires a VTK object
----

I don't have any clue about what to do - I suspect it has something to 
do with the new ubuntu 12.04. Maybe I should fill in a bug report 
somewhere to ubuntu maintainers (not expactly sure where, however)? Also 
the pvpython thing, maybe should make me fill in a bug report for ubuntu 
12.04 ?
------
$ pvpython test.py
Error converting executable file "/usr/bin/../lib/paraview/pvpython" to 
real path: No such file or directory
------

Thanks, although it annoys me such a simple example is not working... I 
cannot get starting learning vtk if I cannot run the simplest 
examples... :-(

Subject: [Paraview] Domain-boundary colour
Message-ID: <CAKbSO=u3HrbaV5Qx66VB2EEXS-S0EQi_wpa8xOfcpBLCFMr_1g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I have a domain which is white in colour and i need the background to be
white for printing purposes. So in order to differentiate the domain I need
my domain boundary to be in black. So far I have tried everything in the
colour palette, changing foreground colour to black, etc. but nothing
works. To make the query clearer: I plot the velocity in my domain and most
places it is set to be white colour; since my background too is white i
need to differentiate the domain from my background by giving a border of
black to the domain. Kindly help.
Leo.

If I understand your original question correctly, it sounds like you 
want to exaggerate the Z scale with respect to X and Y so that you 
can see your data better.

There are a couple of ways to do that.  The more general way would be 
to apply a Transform filter to your data after it is input, changing 
the scale on the Z axis to be higher than 1.  This has the benefit of 
following through to all future visualizations extracted from that data set.

The second approach is to adjust the Z scale on the Display tab for 
every visualization you produce, again adjusting the Z axis scale to 
be larger than 1.

You'd  also need to add the following stub in

  <Proxy group="sources" name="FluentSeriesReader" />

You are mixing VTK's python interface and ParaView's but they are not
completely interchangeable.

If you are trying to learn VTK, I suggest you compile VTK from source
with python wrapping enabled and use that directly. Although people
have used ParaView as quick way to get a vtkpython shell, the client
server  architecture of ParaView and the higher level wrapping of
objects that paraview.simple gives you is going to be a source of
confusion.

If you are trying to learn ParaView's client side python interface, I
suggest you start with the trace feature of ParaView and then look at
http://www.itk.org/Wiki/ParaView/Python_Scripting for explanations of
the things in the trace that are unfamiliar.

Oh, I just suddenly found out that I can "save trace" from within 
paraview and maybe things are working a bit more correct, from within 
the python shell from paraview... After I "save trace" to a .py file, I 
can exit paraview and write "python filename.py" and then it seems to do 
what I want it to do.... That's great...

To answer you, David: I really really hate to have to compile paraview 
from source because the great thing about ubuntu package system is that 
it installs system files and takes care of my dependencies which is 
always a huge problem.... Having realized that the save trace works, and 
then I can do things from the console, is ok for a start for me - at 
least... I'll write back to the list, if I run into big trouble. Thanks 
David... Maybe you could also comment on the ubuntu package-system, it 
sounds like you don't think it is so good or that it - interferes with 
vtk - if I understand you correct?

Thans a lot for the itk.org reference/link also... Very interesting 
stuff to read...

Not quite. I assume the ubuntu packages (for both VTK and ParaView)
are fine. What I am saying is that you should understand that there is
a difference between VTK and ParaView.

Oh, so "I suggest you compile VTK from source, with python wrapping 
enabled and use that directly" wasn't any criticism of ubuntu's package 
system?

I'm not good enough at understanding the whole difference between vtk 
and paraview, but in any case (you already wrote an explanation) I can 
now do some basic things by saving a script from inside of paraview and 
running/modifying it from the terminal... This is ok for me, at this 
very initial stage... When I learn more, I'll always ask again.

No it wasn't. It was just a suggestion for how to obtain the vtkpython
executable. I didn't even realize you were running linux when I wrote
it, actually.

"apt-get python-vtk"

Should also work to get a python interface to VTK.
