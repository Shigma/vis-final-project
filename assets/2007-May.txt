Subject: [Paraview] reading .raw files with vtk
Message-ID: <4637568A.6080003@gmx.ch>

Hi,

I'm quite new in leaning vtk (with tcl for the moment...), but i'd like 
to visualize 3D ".raw" data (from x-ray tomography).

Does anybody have a script example for that? That would be very helpfull.

I'm dealing with 8-bit, little endian data, with an extent of 512 
quadratic voxel of 2.8 um in each x,y, and z direction.

Thanks for your attention and have a nice day!

Milan

Hi Folks,

Kitware, Sandia National Laboratories and CSimSoft are proud to
announce the release of ParaView 3.0 beta. You can download it from
http://paraview.org/HTML/Download.html. This is our first candidate
for the 3.0 release. We hope to release 3.0 in 2 weeks. I will post
more detailed release notes at that time. For now, you can find
release notes from previous alpha releases here:
http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView_III_snapshots and some more
information about ParaView 3 here:
http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView_III

Have fun.

Subject: [Paraview] paraview 3 beta: define camera position and view
Message-ID: <46378EB6.6070807@gmx.de>

Hi,

I am looking for a way to define different camera positions and view
in the new beta version. I tried the lookmark's camera settings, but
they do not work and are not useful for defining the position...

Probably the best way to do it, is to use the 'programable filter'
and some python commands. Does anyone know a better solution or
maybe have an idea, how those python lines may look like for the
purpose?

Greetings!
Fabian

P.S. Good Work!

Uh, could have helped you if you wanted python or C, but not for tcl :-(

Great news, Berk ! :-)))

I was impatient and wondering when 2.9.10 will be published...

I understand better, now ;-)

Subject: [Paraview] Plot3D
Message-ID: <463781AC.7000601@gmail.com>

Hello

Help me pleeeeeease! I'm using paraview 2.6.0. I am trying to read a 
plot3D dataset generated by (as per 
http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/wind/valid/plot3d.html):

C open grid file
      OPEN(1,FILE="grid.xyz", form="unformatted", action="write")
      rewind (1)

      write(1) 1
! write size
      write(1) ni,nj,nk
! write coordinates
      write(1)  (((x(I,J,K),I=1,ni),J=1,nj),K=1,nk),
     &          (((y(I,J,K),I=1,ni),J=1,nj),K=1,nk),
     &          (((z(I,J,K),I=1,ni),J=1,nj),K=1,nk)
      close(1)
      OPEN(1,FILE="grid.q", form="unformatted", action="write")
      rewind (1)
! write size
      write(1) 1

      write(1) (((( vars(i,j,k,l), i = 1, ni),
     &   j = 1, nj), k = 1, nk), l = 1, 5 )
      close(1)

Which fails. The error message I get is


ErrorMessage
# Error or warning: There was a VTK Error in file:

changing parameters.
ErrorMessage end


I have tried reading with "binary on" and "fortran byte count" on/off, 
multiblock on/off to no avail. Tecplot imports the same dataset without 
complaints. I ran out of ideas.

What am I doing wrong????

Hi,
Just updated from cvs.

It seems that an old issue has come back ;-)
It has worked in the previous releases, but now, changing color of the 
outline box is
not more possible (or may be I'm doing something wrong ?)

In fact, it does not work only for PolyData and UnstructuredGrid.

Instead of the "Set Solid Color" item in Color menu,
a "Rescale to Data Range" item appears.

What's going on ?

Ok, nothing wrong.

Clicking on "Solid Color" item in the toolbar fixes the issue.

Forget my previous post ;-)

and it works, at least for the file versions 2.9.9 and 2.9.8
couldn't read, even if 2.9.7 and 2.6 had no problem to read it.
I had long fights against 2.9.9, now it's time to have long
nights of pleasure with 3.0.0 :)

Thanks,

Olivier.

I don't see PARAVIEW_ENABLE_PYTHON_FILTER flag
in cmake.

Where is it gone ?

Or I missed something enabled ?

That flag has been replaced by PARAVIEW_ENABLE_PYTHON flag which enables
Python filter as well as python based testing.

I am on travel right now, otherwise I would be happy to help you.  My first
guess to this is that ParaView is getting confused between the XMol Molecule
files and Plot3D.

https://visualization.hpc.mil/wiki/index.php/Paraview_Data_Formats#Supported_Data_Formats

My second guess is that ParaView is not liking the Fortran Binary Plot3D
file.  Otherwise it looks like you are writing it out correctly.

You can write C binary VTK files directly from Fortran using the latest
gfortran compiler. For example, suppose I have a rectilinear grid, and I
wish to write out a scalar field called Fraction.

!......................................................................
!.....Write out Grid File in VTK format
!......................................................................
        open(11,file=solnfn,access='stream',status='new',convert=
'big_endian')
        write(11) "# vtk DataFile Version 3.0"//char(10)
        write(11) "Insert Comment Here"//char(10)
        write(11) "BINARY"//char(10)
        write(11) "DATASET RECTILINEAR_GRID"//char(10)
        write(ss,fmt='(A10,3I5)') "DIMENSIONS",ni,nj,nk
        write(11) ss//char(10)
        write(ss,fmt='(A13,I6,A6)') "X_COORDINATES",ni," float"
        write(11) ss//char(10)
        write(11) (x(i),i=1,ni)
        write(ss,fmt='(A13,I6,A6)') "Y_COORDINATES",nj," float"
        write(11) char(10)//ss//char(10)
        write(11) (y(j),j=1,nj)
        write(ss,fmt='(A13,I6,A6)') "Z_COORDINATES",nk," float"
        write(11) char(10)//ss//char(10)
        write(11) (z(k),k=1,nk)

        write(ss,fmt='(A10,I15)') "POINT_DATA",ni*nj*nk
        write(11) char(10)//ss//char(10)
        write(11) "SCALARS Scalar_Name float 1"//char(10)
        write(11) "LOOKUP_TABLE default"//char(10)
        write(11) f


All that is left to do then is to compile it with the following command:

gfortran -o 2vtk 2vtk.f90 -fconvert=big-endian -frecord-marker=4

Hi All.

That`s more like a VTK question. But maybe some of you
have had a problem like this.

I have an UnstructuredGrid witch
I must take the difference of it from a vtkSphere implicit function.

Basically, I`m using the vtkImplicitDataSet to turn my UG into an
Implicit Function and the using the vtkImplicitBoolean to make its
difference (just like the IceCreamBite example, also using the
vtkSampleFunction). I`ve also added some scalars to the Unstructured Grid,
so the ImplicitDataSet filter stops complaining.?Well, as Output I`m
getting just the sphere.?

I have also tried the
vtkGeometryFilter, but it had no effect.

If anyone has been
through something like this and could get me a hand, I would really
apreciate.

Thank`s in advance to you all.

Paul, thanks a bunch!

convert='big_endian' does the job. 

I post complete description to avoid such question in future.

The followinjg code generates a plot3D file which is read by 2.6.0 
without problems with the following options:
Binary
Multiblock
Fortran byte order

compiler: ifort 9.1 20061101

==========================
Fortran code example:



      program write_example
      implicit none

      real x(21,21,21),y(21,21,21),z(21,21,21)
      real vars(21,21,21,5), r, alpha
      integer ni,nj,nk,i,j,k,l

!   create gridpoints for a simple example:
      ni=21
      nj=21
      nk=21
      do k=1,nk
        do j=1,nj
          do i=1,ni
            x(i,j,k)=real(i-ni/2,kind=4)/ni*2.
            y(i,j,k)=real(j-nj/2,kind=4)/nj*2.
            z(i,j,k)=real(k-1,kind=4)/nk*10.
            r=exp(-sqrt(x(i,j,k)**2+y(i,j,k)**2))*z(i,j,k)/10.
            alpha=atan(y(i,j,k)/(x(i,j,k)+1.e-6))
            vars(i,j,k,1)=1.
            vars(i,j,k,2)=r*sin(alpha)

            vars(i,j,k,4)=0.01
            vars(i,j,k,5)=1.
          enddo

As an alternative, you can change the Byte Order flag in ParaView to
Little Endian... The flags I used to read the file were:
Binary, MultiGrid, Has Byte Count, Byte Order: Little Endian

Hi Vinicius,

In ParaView (or VTK), have you tried applying the Clip filter to your 
unstructured grid? You can use a vtkSphere as the clip function. This 
way you don't have to convert your dataset to an implicit function.

Hi Amy!
Thank you for answering!

And the answer for your
question is yes, I`ve tried to use vtkClipDataSet. The problem is that I
need to fill the clipped area, just like the Ice Cream example. Then also,
I would end up getting to the old problem, that is having to use my
UnstructuredGrid as an implicit function to make operation with a sphere.
And also, I would probably have to sew the two meshes manually.

That`s why I`ve changed my path for resolving this problem to the
vtkImplicitBoolean. But, I`ve no problems with changing my path again. So,
if any solution appears with another tools, I`m all ears!
: )

Thank`s again for your time!

Hi Vinicius,

If you want to fill the clipped area, you could try the following. In 
addition to using vtkClipDataSet, also pass your original unstructured 
grid through the vtkCutter filter. Use the same vtkSphere implicit 
function that you used with vtkClipDataSet. Then to put the output of 
vtkClipDataSet and vtkCutter together, you could use vtkAppendFilter. 
The output of vtkAppendFilter is still vtkUnstructuredGrid.

Subject: [Paraview] Clean to Grid, 'tolerance' parameter
Message-ID: <4638CAFB.3060301@cora.nwra.com>

  Does anyone know if there is a straightforward way to change the 
tolerance in the Clean to Grid filter?

I see there was a previous bug report about this, and that it was
closed. Has someone found a way to effect the 'tolerance' parameter or 
was it decided that it was not needed?
"Bug #1482 - SNL: Clean to Grid should have a 'tolerance' parameter"

The reason I am looking to change the tolerance is that I have spectral 
element code the writes vtk files. The Spectral elements, which in turn 
contain norder^3 collocation elements that are represented as hexahedra, 
are written such that the coincident vertices are not really shared in 
the vtk representation. I then can sometimes use CleanToGrid in in PV to 
merge them but often the distance between the "coincident" vertices 
exceeds the default tolerance in the CleanToGrid  filter.

Thanks for any help.

Dan

PS. Just tried 3.0 Beta.. Looks cool. Thanks for all the great work!

Ok, thanks.

PS : the video helped, or not ? ;-)
In others words, is it useful to proceed like this ?

It helped. However, I had difficulty playing it with VLC on a Mac. It
produced errors and randomly stopped several times.

Uh, my vlc (0.8.6a) can't even read it ! :-(
Anyway, mplayer (1.0-rc1) and gxine (0.5.11) can read it successfully.

Subject: [Paraview] Problems reading distributed data
Message-ID: <006801c78d7e$f1daea00$d590be00$@bau.tu-bs.de>

Hi Everybody,

after reading the Paraview guide and other sources I am still not able to
load parallel written image data (pvti) into ParaView. 
First the pvti file:

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<VTKFile type="PImageData" version="0.1" byte_order="LittleEndian">
  <PImageData WholeExtent="    0   50    0   50    0   50" Origin="0 0 0"
Spacing="1 1 1">
    <PPointData>
    </PPointData>
    <PCellData>
      <PDataArray type="Float32" Name="pressure"/>
      <PDataArray type="Float32" Name="phase"/>
      <PDataArray type="Float32" Name="velocity" NumberOfComponents="3"/>
    </PCellData>
    <Piece Extent="    0   25    0   25    0   50"
Source="bubble.test1.0000.pt.00000000.vti"/>
    <Piece Extent="    0   25   25   50    0   50"
Source="bubble.test1.0001.pt.00000000.vti"/>
    <Piece Extent="   25   50    0   25    0   50"
Source="bubble.test1.0002.pt.00000000.vti"/>
    <Piece Extent="   25   50   25   50    0   50"
Source="bubble.test1.0003.pt.00000000.vti"/>
  </PImageData>
</VTKFile>

The pieces are distributed to _local_ diskspace on _different_ nodes, which
means:

	<Piece Extent="    0   25    0   25    0   50"
Source="bubble.test1.0000.pt.00000000.vti"/>
	<Piece Extent="    0   25   25   50    0   50"
Source="bubble.test1.0001.pt.00000000.vti"/>

are on, lets say, node1 and

	<Piece Extent="   25   50    0   25    0   50"
Source="bubble.test1.0002.pt.00000000.vti"/>
	<Piece Extent="   25   50   25   50    0   50"
Source="bubble.test1.0003.pt.00000000.vti"/>

are on node2. Additionally the .pvti file is located in the same directory
on both nodes. After starting ParaView in parallel on both nodes (dataserver
and renderserver, pvclient on the masternode - which is by the way working
fine...) the dataserver issues error messages about missing pieces and it's
extents, e.g.:

Process id: 2 >> ERROR: In
/scratch/paraview_cvs/ParaView/VTK/IO/vtkXMLPStructuredDataReader.cxx, line
450
vtkXMLPImageDataReader (0x36ff010): No available piece provides data for the
following extents:
    0 25  0 25  25 50
The UpdateExtent cannot be filled.

The question now is how to tell ParaView where to look for the right pieces?
Our cluster file system is very slow, so that dumping all data into a single
folder is unfortunatly not an option. I tried different data files and e.g.
Polydata (.pvtp) seem not to care about extends (of course) and are loaded
from different nodes without complains. 

Has anybody an answer to that issue? I would be very thankful!

Cheers,

Benjamin

Is there any way for a filter to create it's own vtkCornerAnnotation object
for data display, or to access the one that already exists in the main
window?

Hi Amy! Thank you so much for answering again.

Before your
help, I was just using the vtkClipDataSet. By your using vtkCutter idea, I
now have an UnstructuredGrid with its respective scalars making the
contour of my cut / clip. The idea is for me to use this UG as an implicit
function for clipping a vtkSphereSource, so I can get the volumetric
intersection of the sphere with the arthery (thats right, I need the
sphere piece that is inside arthery). But my problems (since from the
beginning) are actually on using the vtkImplicitDataSet feeded by a
vtkUnstructuredGrid. When I use an structured grid, the vtkImplicitDataSet
works perfectly. But using a UG, it doesn`t.

Any Ideas? Amy?
Anyone?

Hallo,

in the paraview guide there is only shown an
animation example with plot3d-files.

when I want to do animation with a vtk-file :

1) is it possible ?
2) can I use just one vtk-files with all the results for all timesteps
   included?
3) is there a vtk-example somewhere?

thanks very much for help!

Best regards
Franz

Yes. If there is a series of VTK files in a directory whose names differ only 
by a number then PV will use them all in an animation. For example: test1.vtk, 
test2.vtk, ..., test100.vtk. There may be some additional requirements.

No. There is no VTK file format that allows that (consult the VTK file format 
document).

However, PV understands a format called "pvd" which is a metafile (no data) 
that references any number of additional VTK files that contain the data at 
each time. However, in this case, the VTK files must use the newer XMl-based 
format.

Did you try using the SetText method from vtkCornerAnnotation. I have never
used it but assume that its used for displaying text in the corners. I'm
referring to SetText( int i, const char* text).

Mike,

I posted a general solution to the mailing list two weeks ago. Meanwhile, I 
found also a way to modify the parallax by changing the EyeAngle property of 
the active camera. But keep into mind that my solution must be re-compiled 
into Paraview. It works fine with Linux in single display mode. I am not sure 
if this is the way to do that in ParaView. Anyway, this could help your 
friend with his Mac.

Subject: [Paraview] building paraview3 beta with openmpi?
Message-ID: <e8289c090705040925p624ea60fyeee8fdeb72834375@mail.gmail.com>

hi,

i successfully compiled paraview3 beta with openmpi 1.0.2 by setting

SET(CMAKE_C_COMPILER mpicc)
SET(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER mpicxx)

in my CMakeLists.txt file, and then running cmake like this:

cmake -DVTK_USE_MPI:BOOL=ON \
-DVTK__MPIRUN_EXE:FILEPATH=/path_to_openmpi/openmpi1.0.2/bin/ \
/path_to_paraview3_src/ParaView3/

and when i try to run

mpiexec -n 4 ./paraview

from within my paraview3 bin directory, i get 4 paraview windows rather
than a single window running in parallel mode.  i have made sure the path
to the openmpi bin is on the top of my path, and the path to openmpi lib is
on the top of my ld_library_path environment variable, but still no luck.  i
have no trouble running paraview2.6 with this same command, built with
the same modifications to CMakeLists.txt and the cmake command line.

any help much appreciated,
bryan

Unlike ParaView 2, the ParaView 3 client application cannot be run in
parallel.  Instead, you have to run pvserver in parallel and connect to
that.  In this mode, you still get all the parallel features of
ParaView.

Hi,

me again...

Sorry, but does nobody need such a feature in paraview or am I to
stupid to find it?

So where do we post bugs and feature requests/Fixes?

PV III is crashing on OS X intel (10.4.9)

Exception:  EXC_BAD_ACCESS (0x0001)
Codes:      KERN_PROTECTION_FAILURE (0x0002) at 0x00000028

Thread 0 Crashed:
0   libpqCore.dylib            	0x0106d262  
pqRenderViewModule::fakeInteraction(bool) + 18


Also I am interested in the Multi-Render views. I would like to have  
two views and have each view have its own independent data set? is  
that Possible?

I have some more bugs but I'll wait for an answer to "where to post  
bugs" first..

Thanks for the great work.

You can report bugs and feature requests to the paraview bug tracker.

You have to be more specific about the crash. I have been using and
testing paraview 3 on multiple macs and it works fine for me. I just
downloaded the 3.0 binary at home to make sure and it runs fine. On
top of this,  we have nightly dashboards
(http://paraview.org/ParaView3/Testing/Dashboard/MostRecentResults-Nightly/Dashboard.html)
that test paraview on both a Mac Mini and a Mac Pro. Andy has been
using it on he MacBook Pro as well. I'll ask him to try the 3.0 beta
binary.

Yes. It is possible to have multiple views with independent datasets.
You can create new views by splitting existing one. Each view is
independent (unless you link them in some way) and can display any
dataset with any representation independent of others.

Subject: [Paraview] Extending Broken in 2.6.0
Message-ID: <463F220E.3070707@psc.edu>

Extending PV at compile time seems to be broken in 2.6.0. The following 
(slightly edited) is printed when the new filter, vtkCloud, is instanced:

======
# Error or warning: There was a VTK Error in file: 
<src>/Servers/Common/vtkProcessModule.cxx (966)
  vtkProcessModule (0xc448130): Object type: vtkCloud, could not find requested 
method: "SetInput"
or the method was called with incorrect arguments.
while processing
Message 0 = Invoke
   Argument 0 = id_value {811}
   Argument 1 = string_value {SetInput}
   Argument 2 = id_value {589}
ErrorMessage end
ErrorMessage
# Error or warning: There was a VTK Error in file: 
<src>/Servers/Common/vtkProcessModule.cxx (968)
======

This filter was added to 2.4.4 with no problem. I don't see any changes for 
2.6.0 at

    http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView:Extend

Has anyone else been able to extend 2.6.0 at compile time?

Thanks!

The "SetInput" method was used in PV 2.4. "SetInputConnection" is used in PV
2.6.

Thanks for the suggestion!

But now I am confused on two counts (at least).

First, the error message says it was looking for "SetInput" not 
"SetInputConnection".

Second, I thought the name of this routine was arbitrary. The new filter's xml 
for the server manager reads (in part):

<ServerManagerConfiguration>
    <ProxyGroup name="filters">
       <SourceProxy name="Cloud" class="vtkCloud">
          <InputProperty name="Input" command="SetInput">
          ... more

Since the command is "SetInput" and the C++ class' method is "SetInput" I would 
have thought that was all there was to it. Is that wrong?

Thanks again!

I was stuck on that for a while too. But PV 2.6 rejects the "SetInput"
method. So you need to change to "SetInputConnection" in both your
xml(server manager) and code.

so i now tried this:

python -c "import os; os.system('mpiexec -n 4 pvserver')"

and i still get the same error as shown below.  but now, it
looks like when i interact with the data, 2 of my 4 cpus are 
being used (the system is a dual opteron, so 4 cores total).
still, when actually computing the geometry, only one cpu
is being used, while in paraview2.6 i see all 4 processes as
active when the geometry is being computed.  maybe i am 
comparing apples to oranges, but it seems like something's
not quite right here.

thanks,
bryan

Subject: [Paraview] building paraview3 beta with openmpi?

 

hi,

i successfully compiled paraview3 beta with openmpi 1.0.2 by setting

SET(CMAKE_C_COMPILER mpicc)
SET(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER mpicxx)

in my CMakeLists.txt file, and then running cmake like this:

cmake -DVTK_USE_MPI:BOOL=ON \
-DVTK__MPIRUN_EXE:FILEPATH=/path_to_openmpi/openmpi1.0.2/bin/ \
/path_to_paraview3_src/ParaView3/

and when i try to run

mpiexec -n 4 ./paraview

from within my paraview3 bin directory, i get 4 paraview windows rather 
than a single window running in parallel mode.  i have made sure the
path 
to the openmpi bin is on the top of my path, and the path to openmpi lib
is 
on the top of my ld_library_path environment variable, but still no
luck.  i 
have no trouble running paraview2.6 with this same command, built with
the same modifications to CMakeLists.txt and the cmake command line.

any help much appreciated,
bryan

It almost looks like pvserver is not compiled with MPI and mpiexec is
starting 4 completely independent pvservers. Then the client is
probably connecting to just one of those. What do you see when look at
processes after mpiexec? Are there 4 pvserver processes? Also, what
happens if you create a sphere and apply Process Id Scalars? Do you
see 4 pieces or just 1?

SetInputConnection() is now the preferred way to connect algorithms in
VTK (as of 5.0). Therefore, as of ParaView 2.6, we require using
SetInputConnection() instead of SetInput(). In VTK, SetInput() was
kept due to backward compatibility and also to be able to assign data
objects as inputs. We should have documented this better. I apologize.
We will be more careful with documenting this sort of API changes
after 3.0.

No, you are not that stupid.  I think the resounding silence is because
no one has addressed this issue.  PV 2 has some camera controls,
including saving and restoring camera state that are not yet available
in PV 3.  This is more-or-less captured in bug #4157.  Although we plan
to do this, it has been a pretty low priority because it is not one of
the more commonly used features in PV 2.

If you need to specifically set a camera coordinate, there may be
indirect ways to do this.  I don't think programmable filter is one of
them, because filters do not have access to camera position.  There is,
however, a python shell (Tools -> Python Shell) that may have access.
Someone with more knowledge on the Python bindings would have to answer
that.

Thanks!

Here is a related discovery that others might find useful.

I am developing a new reader using (incorrectly) SetInput. When things failed 
PV produced a half dozen error messages related to the LSDyna reader followed 
by the error message related to my new reader. That is what really threw me - 
my reader has nothing to do with LSDyna and looks for a different file 
extension. It is almost as if PV, when it couldn't find my SetInput, became 
despondent and started wandering aimlessly through the other readers before 
committing suicide. Maybe PV is becomming self aware ...

Hi Mike,

Although we can't reproduce the crash without more specific
instructions, looking at the stack trace you sent, we believe that we
already fixed it. The fix will be in the 3.0 release.

I'm using ParaView 2.6.1 with a 2D VTK legacy structured dataset.  In
the edit color-map panel, I can set the out of range colors to black,
grey, white, etc. ( the same as the background).  However, I have other
data "behind" the dataset that I would like to show at the same time.
Is it possible to set the out of range colors to "transparent"?

there is only 1 pvserver process when i check with top.
mpiexec is also running, so that part seems to have
worked, but only one pvserver is showing up.

i see one blue sphere.

thanks for the leads, hope this helps figure things out.

Ah, I found the problem. You need to set PARAVIEW_USE_MPI instead of
VTK_USE_MPI.

Hi everybody.

I created a filter and my interface (vtkPV* file)
inherits from vtkPVObjectWidget.
When my filter is created, it
appears in the "Selection Window" as expected. I would
like
to know which method of vtkPVObjectWidget is called when I clicked in the
"eye"
button?

Hi Kenneth,

the python shell sounds good enough for me too, but do you have a
hint where I can find some good python shell (and filters) examples?
I like python a lot and would like to use it more with paraview. ...
Maybe, someone can give some hints with the camera position!? I know
the syntax for python-vtk,but this probably won't work with paraview...

Greetings!
Fabian

ok, got this to work, now i see 4 pvserver-real processes,
and one paraview-real process.  when i use the default
settings for sphere and then process id scalars, i see the
sphere with 4 colors, as expected.

however, when i try to increase the theta resolution, i am
no longer able to see the sphere, and in its place, i see a
little portion of the paraview window (i.e. rather than the
sphere in the view window, i see a small part of the left-
hand frame of the paraview window).  is this because i
have to use offscreen rendering when running paraview3
in parallel mode on a single, multi-cpu machine?  or is
there something else i have mucked up here?

thanks,
bryan

Yup. You should either use offscreen rendering or disable compositing
(from Preferences, Server, I think).

Message-ID: <e8289c090705071639q6ae057e5m43df378aaac6f9c2@mail.gmail.com>

hi,

i am running paraview3 beta (cvs checkout today, 2007.05.07)
with openmpi, and i am having some trouble getting the surface
color widget to show up.  it seems i have to first tell paraview to
color by normals, then switch back to color by scalars, which
then brings up the color selection button.  strange behavior.

i've also found that when some transparency is set, the integrity
of the isosurface is poor... that is, there are some raster lines in
and other artifacts in the surface.  anyone experienced the same
on their build of paraview3?  i am running on linux64 (suse 10.0)
with the latest build of the drivers for my graphics card.  i have
composite rendering turned off, and am running in server/client
mode on a single (4-process) machine.

i looked briefly and couldn't find these issues listed in the known
bugs list, but did not look extensively.

    I also wrote a reader for our data files and ran into the same  
problem. The LSDyna reader data files do NOT have extensions so the  
LSDyna reader will respond that it can read to _any_ file. Therefor  
it will not matter what extension you use the LSDyna reader will try  
to open. I asked about this earlier on this list on Feb 7, 2007. The  
subject was "LSDynaReader interferring with my own reader".

The response I got from was:

The proper way to avoid CanReadFile being called on
a large number of files is to have your reader placed
at the top of the list of all readers, rather than the
bottom. That seems like the proper behavior anyway, allowing
people to override the default set of readers shipped with
ParaView even where filename extensions conflict.

This is a known bug. Someone reported it previously. I believe someone
in the team either fixed it or will fix it.

A screenshot would be helpful in tracing this.

Actually, the right way of dealing with this is assigning priorities
to readers and have paraview try readers in the order of priority.
LSDyna would have a priority of -infinity :-) I cannot guarantee we
would implement it quickly but I suggest putting in a feature request
for it.

First of all, I have to apologize... I did commit a fix to stop the
LS-Dyna reader from printing crud out from within CanReadFile, but it
apparently did not make it into the 2.6 branch. I've just sent a patch
to Amy to be included if there are any more 2.6 releases.

Yes, although I could make a similar rant along the lines of "You mean
there are still applications that have to determine a file's type by its
extension?" or "You mean there are still file selection dialogs that
won't let you choose a file because it happens to be a directory?"

I would like to suggest an alternative: have readers register mime types
as well as file extensions. Then libmagic (see
ftp://ftp.astron.com/pub/file/file-4.20.tar.gz) or other OS-specific
utilities (i.e., file attributes on MacOS X) could be used to find the
proper reader without instantiating any readers and without the overhead
of calling many CanReadFile implementations on many files.

ok... i'll take your word for it. :)  i have now looked through all the
paraview3 bugs on the bug tracker and i didn't see it, so if you want
me to report it, let me know.

ok, will do tomorrow when at the work machine where this happens.
basically, the image is corrupted in the sense that there are lines and
other artifacts that make it look like the transparency has not been
appropriately assigned to all faces of the mesh.  might be an mpi or
graphics card issue if this has not been seen by other users...

Message-ID: <20070508100531.4so6ty5ono08cowo@webmail4.kuleuven.be>


Hello,

I`m extending the output of a fortran code, using Adaptive Mesh
Refinement, so that the output is .vtm metafile, type
vtkHierarchicalBoxDataSet.  Each of the datasets (which means: the
data of each of the grids) is saved in a different .vti-file.  Now,
that works fine.  Except for one small problem.  I`ve got millions of
grids, which means I also got millions of files.  Trying to cure this
problem, I thought that about putting lots of grids together in one
file, using the <piece>s.  My first idea was to put all data from the
same level in the same file.  The problem with this idea is that the
"Whole Extent" isn`t a rectangle anymore.  When I make the
<WholeExtent> a rectangle, which is not fully covered by the <piece>s,
There seem to happen strange things with the parts wich are not
covered by the <piece>s: They get random colours (while I thought that
the group argument would be used to look at the underlying grids, from
coarser levels.)

So my question is the following.  Is it necessary that the
<wholeExtent> is fully covered by its <piece Extent>s?  Is there a way  
around this problem?

I attached artificial .vtm and .vti files, where you can see the problem:
(The <WholeExtent> for the last file is not covered by all of its
<Piece Extent>s. The missing part seems to be coloured ramdomly.)

Greetings,
and thanks in advance,
(any reaction can be helpful)

Subject: [Paraview] Can't connect any more in pv3
Message-ID: <46405303.1060608@cscs.ch>

I've been using pv3 all day long to connect using reverse connection to 
an mpi spawned server, then I though I'd save myself some fiddling, by 
entering the command into the configuration dialog for the connection so 
that paraview client would
ssh machineX mpirun -hostfile /users/biddisco/build/pv3/bin/pvserver -rc 
--client-host=machineA
etc etc
It worked ok the first time, then I fiddled some more and now despite 
deleting all servers, removing the paraview .config file, reentering 
servers the way I've been doing for weeks, I cannot get anything except 
this message from the client


ERROR: In 
/users/biddisco/code/ParaView3/Servers/Common/vtkProcessModuleConnectionManager.cxx, 
line 180
vtkProcessModuleConnectionManager (0x4f69290): Failed to set up server 
socket.

ERROR: In 
/users/biddisco/code/ParaView3/Servers/Common/vtkProcessModuleConnectionManager.cxx, 
line 200
vtkProcessModuleConnectionManager (0x4f69290): Invalid ServerSocket id: -1


I didn't do anything else to the system except change servers - then 
delete them and re-enter them. Reverse connection just fils immediately 
now, whereas it used to open up the dialog and wait for a connection...

What do the two lines of error above really tell me, and how can I make 
them go away. Unless someone has secretly reconfigured the network 
whilst I wasn't looking, I cannot imagine why these errors suddenly 
appeared.

Clues?

thanks

JB

I am a mac guy so I am all in favor of the world moving to a  
filesystem that supports resource forks, file types and file creator  
codes, but until that happens we all get to play in a world with file  
extensions.

  Here is the work around for those wishing to "fix" readers that  
insist on reading every file: I'll use the LSDyna Reader as an example:

Look in ParaView-2.6.1/GUI/Client/Resources/Readers.xml at line 931:  
Change the <Module .... > section to the following:

   <Module name="LSDynaReader"
           root_name="LSDynaReader"
           output="vtkMultiBlockDataSet"
           class="vtkPVAdvancedReaderModule"
           module_type="Reader"
           extensions=".d3plot .k .lsdyna"
           always_try_can_read="0"
           file_description="LSDyna">
     <Source class="vtkLSDynaReader"/>

Also note that there is an error on line 936. There is a missing "."  
before "d3plot". This should stop the LSDyna reader for reading files  
it shouldn't.

Recompile ParaView.

Cheers, Peace
Mike Jackson

hi,

i have a vtk file loaded into paraview3, and i have made an
isosurface rendering.  when i want to select the vtk object
in the pipeline browser (because, for example, i want to try
and draw another surface with a different isovalue), i see
this pkdtree thing show up in the progress bar, and it takes
a long time (10s of seconds) just to reset all the controls
(object inspector, etc) to reflect that i have selected the vtk
source rather than the contour.

Are you running in parallel?  And do you have the opacity set to less
than 1?  In order to render correctly in this case, ParaView
redistributes the surface data on the server.  vtkPKdTree is used in
that process.  If you set the opacity to 1, then you should not have to
wait.

Ouch! That is some seriously complicated geometry! I think you are
running into the limitations of the depth-peeling algorithm that is
used to render transparent geometry. You can try to increase some of
these limits by recompiling ParaView. In the source code, you have to
edit VTK/Rendering/vtkRenderer.cxx and change MaximumNumberOfPeels on
line 119 to something higher, maybe 10-20. However, this will reduce
rendering speed because each peel roughly corresponds to 1 render.

one I reported a year ago.

Berk, last time you mentioned that it is probably an OpenGL bug.
ParaView was built against Mesa from this weeks CVS head.

I made a bug report a long time ago:

i am not sure this is the problem... when i look at the source for
vtkRenderer.cxx in ParaView2.6 and ParaView3, these fields are
exactly the same:

this->MaximumNumberOfPeels=4;

and the exact same dataset on the exact same machine appears
as expected in ParaView2.6 (i.e. without these raster artifacts).  or
is there something i am missing here?  i looked at the diff between
the two files, and there is a bunch of different stuff (version number
is 1.231 versus 1.233) including a bunch of calls where, in 1.231
there are references to "Render translucent geometry" that in ver
1.233 it says "Render translucent polygonal geometry".  these sorts
of things appear to make up a majority of the diff b/t the versions.  i
can post the diff if it will be useful (though i am sure everyone here
can easily generate it themselves).

thanks again,
bryan

Hi Kevin,

You mean against Mesa CVS? It does look like a Mesa bug.  We should
report it to them. Can you reproduce it with an older version of Mesa?
We need to figure out when it was introduced.

Depth-peeling is off in 2.6 so that parameter would have no effect.
However, at the same time, transparency is plain wrong in 2.6.
Depth-peeling addresses this problem. To see this in action, compare
how two sphere with transparency are rendered between 2.6 and 3.0.

hi,

i have made isosurfaces of an object in paraview3, and i
want to have two levels of transparency, the 'outer' surface
with a lower opacity value than the inner surface.  however,
when i try to do this, despite both surfaces appearing to be
transparent, when the outer surface occludes the inner one,
i cannot see the inner surface at all (which i should be able
to view through the transparent outer surface).

I'll back up to the latest stable release of Mesa, 6.4.2, and try it
with that unless you have a specific version in mind.

I'm trying to compile a new reader for 2.6.0 (on Fedora Core 5, P4). The

The new reader uses 6 extra classes to manage information about the files and

Subject: [Paraview] Compiling ParaView 3 on Mac OS X (PowerPC)
Message-ID: <876470izln.fsf@workstation001.office.ice-sf.at>


Hi!

Because there is no binary for Darwin/PowerPC I'm trying to recompile
ParaView3. Has anybody here already done this and give me some
tips. For instance on

http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView:FAQ#How_do_I_compile_ParaView_for_Mac_OS_X.3F

it says to turn off VTK_USE_CARBON and use VTK_USE_X instead, but
there is no option VTK_USE_X anyway (and I think this is obsolete
because now it uses QT, right?).

Speaking of the QT. Which version should I use. Currently I'm trying
to compile it with the OpenDSource-Version I downloaded from Trolltech
(the DMG) but ccmake complains in VTK/GUISupport/Qt/CMakeList.txt it
has an unknown CMake command: QT4_WRAP_CPP. Is this a QT or a CMake
problem. 

Thanks

That information is for ParaView 2.X.  ParaView 3, which has much better
native support for Mac, should compile just fine with the default CMake
options.

We don't have good instructions for building ParaView 3.0 yet. These
should work:

* Download Qt 4.2.2
* Compile and install it (no changes to configuration is necessary)
* Follow the regular cmake process to build paraview
   - Make sure to set QT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE to point to qmake in the Qt
installlation (under bin/ somewhere)

I set the following cmake parameters when building ParaView 3 binaries
for Intel:
PARAVIEW_TESTING_WITH_PYTHON:BOOL=OFF
QT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE:FILEPATH=/opt/qt-4.2.2-framework/bin/qmake
PARAVIEW_ENABLE_PYTHON:BOOL=ON
CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Release
VTK_USE_RPATH:BOOL=ON

This suggests that you are using a much older CMake, ParaView3 requires
CMake 2.4.5

That's great. I've already tried it with those default settings.

But this problem still persists: I don't know too much about cmake,
but am I right that this is a problem with cmake(I'm using 2.4.6) or
the cmake-Files that come with the soure, because I don't find where
QT4_WRAP_CPP is being defined.

QT4_WRAP_CPP is defined in CMake's FindQt4.cmake file, and the macro doesn't 
get defined until qmake is found.
Set the QT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE variable to "/your/path/to/qt4/bin/qmake"
You said you are using Trolltech's DMG install?  I've used that too.

Thanks. It was a stupid typo to the path of qmake. Now everything
compiles OK until at 90% (after a lot of the QT-stuff was successfully
compiled) it says:

[90%] Building CXX object QT/Core/CMakeFiles/pqCore.dir/pqFormBuilder.o
/Library/Frameworks/QTCore.framework/Headers/qglobal.h:606: error: template with C linkage

then lots of similar messages follow. Googling around told me that the
problem could be an unterminated 

extern "C" {

could be the cause.

And this is where I am stuck: usually in that situation I would copy
the last compiler call, add the -E option, look at the output and
find out which header might be the problem. But cmake "protects" me
from that knowledge. Is there a way to find out how the compiler is
called for that file?

Use ccmake to enable CMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE. Then recompile and all  
the calls to gcc and the linker can be seen.

Actually,

	make VERBOSE=1

has the same effect and doesn't require re-running cmake.

That's a problem with the Qt headers.
You can change pqFormBuilder.h
from
#include <QtUiTools/QUiLoader>
to
#include <QUiLoader>

That change isn't in yet because some dashboards are on older CMake's  
that can't find QUiTools correctly.
The Mac dashboards would probably be fine if we put a condiational  
around it for the Mac.

Stupid question again: I've installed the most recent Version I could
get (4.2.3) and everything EXCEPT the QtUiTools go into the
/Library/Frameworks-hierarchy. And that is the part I have the
problems described below with. Could it be an error in the
Qt-distribution?

That Change didn't fix it (QUiLoader was not found because the only

/usr/include/QtUiTools/QUiLoader). As I said above: I suspect the
distribution. Which one did you use?

You'll need that change anyway to build eventually.
You may find the CMake patch found on this bug report useful so  
QtUiTools will be found correctly.
http://www.cmake.org/Bug/bug.php?op=show&bugid=4554&pos=10

For now, you'll have to set them manually.
QT_QTUITOOLS_INCLUDE_DIR:PATH=/usr/include/QtUiTools
QT_QTUITOOLS_LIBRARY_DEBUG:FILEPATH=/usr/lib/libQtUiTools.a
QT_QTUITOOLS_LIBRARY_RELEASE:FILEPATH=/usr/lib/libQtUiTools.a


These problems don't come up if one does their own build & install of  
Qt.  Only with the binary distribution, and I dislike how they've  
done it.   Files scattered in different places. Some under /Library/ 
Frameworks, some under /usr/include & /usr/lib, some under /usr/local/ 
Qt4.2.  So CMake has difficulty in finding all the stuff.  CMake  
relies on qmake to tell it where everything is, and nothing qmake can  
tell you will point you to the QtUiTools stuff (it can tell you where  
the stuff is if you do your own build of Qt).

If you're still having this problem, you can update from CVS, clean your cmake 
cache and build again.  I put some stuff in ParaView's CMakeLists.txt files 
to help out here without user intervention.

Subject: [Paraview] How to Read Transient Structured Data
Message-ID: <4644AFA7.3050302@psc.edu>

I'm developing a new reader for ParaView 2.6.1 built upon 
vtkStructuredGridSource. It responds to pipeline requests via 
ExecuteInformation and ExecuteData.

How do I tell the pipeline about the time steps? The only existing 
reader I could find that uses vtkStructuredGridSource is vtkPLOT3DReader 
which does not seem to produce transient data.

I found another reader that is built on vtkUnstructuredGridAlgorithm 
that responds to pipeline requests via RequestInformation and 
RequestData. The RequestInformation arguments include

    vtkInformationVector *outputVector

that can be used to set vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::TIME_STEPS(). 
But there is no such argument for vtkStructuredGridSource's 
ExecuteInformation.

Suggestions?

TIA

Berk, thanks, but that doesn't help. The Exodus reader uses that same 
technique noted below (a parameter provided by the RequestInformation 
call) that does not exist for vtkStructuredGridSource. Maybe I'm just dense!

Uh. Sorry for not reading your message carefully. You should not
sub-class from vtkStructuredGridSource because it is deprecated.
Sub-class from vtkStructuredGridAlgorithm. Avoid sub-classing from
vtkSource and it's sub-classes. They are there for backward
compatibility.

Thank you very much; I'll re-subclass as suggested. Your note holds what 
I feel is critical information for one building new modules or readers. 
Is this informaton available in one of the books, release notes, Wiki 
pages, etc?

Yes. It is in VTK/Utilities/Upgrading/TheNewVTKPipeline.pdf, first
Kitware Newsletter (http://www.kitware.com/products/newsletter.html)
and the User's Guide. It is also mentioned here:
http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK_FAQ#Roadmap:_What_changes_are_being_considered_for_VTK
(new pipeline mechanism). It sounds like it should have been
announcement more clearly. It looks like we are missing a Changes
between 4.4 and 5.0 section on the vtk wiki. Also, I don't know if
someone is maintaining release note for VTK. Those classes were not
marked deprecated for backwards compatibility reasons. I believe there
is a flag somewhere that removes deprecated code. It should probably
warn about subclassing from vtkSource.

Message-ID: <43a689850705141358t75468f48y91e604e0d895e725@mail.gmail.com>

I recently started using VS 2005 Professional (up from VS 2003 .Net)
and when I compile ParaView (2.4.4) using the "INSTALL" project from
within the VS 2005 solution file everything seems to build and does
get copied to the install location but I noticed that the MS C and C++
runtime libs are no longer copied into the intsall location. Is this a
bug somewhere? Has anyone else noticed this? I used to be able to
right click on the "INSTALL" project, let it run to completion, then
simply copy the Paraview 2.4.4 folder onto a  server for other people
to use. Now I am not sure what else needs to be copied.

Thanks

Hi Mike,

I am not a Windows person but I heard from someone that it is no
longer possible to simply distributed the MS runtime libs. It has
something to do with manifest files or something.  You have to do
something more or install some runtime stuff from Microsoft. I know my
answer is vague :-) I didn't use VS 2005 yet. I am still building with
2003. You may want to ask it to the cmake mailing list.

Subject: [Paraview] CMake finds QT but says it hasn't when compiling
	Paraview3
Message-ID: <87zm46xn5f.fsf@workstation001.office.ice-sf.at>


Hi!

I'm having a problem when i'm trying to configure/compile the latest
CVS-Version of Paraview3 on a Linux machine (Centos5 == RHEL5).

When I'm configuring with cmake (version 2.4.6) it finds the QT4, but
at the end of the configuration it says

 Qt UITOOLS library not found.
 Qt GUI library not found.
 Qt XML library not found.
 Qt NETWORK library not found.
 Qt CORE library not found.

I generate the Makefiles and start compiling. It compiles without
problems until it comes to the QT-stuff. There Compilation stops
because the header QObject is not found. When inspecting the compiler
call I find that it only uses -I/usr/lib64/qt4/include/ but not
-I/usr/lib64/qt4/include/QtCore where that file is found. Completing
that call with that option lets me compile that file but of course
make fails with the next. 

Funny thing is CMakeCache.txt (and ccmake) both show me, that they
know where to find QtCore (and all the other ''missing'' libraries):

//Path to a file.
QT_QTCORE_INCLUDE_DIR:PATH=/usr/lib64/qt4/include/QtCore
//The Qt QTCORE library
QT_QTCORE_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=/usr/lib64/qt4/lib64/libQtCore.so
//Path to a library.
QT_QTCORE_LIBRARY_DEBUG:FILEPATH=QT_QTCORE_LIBRARY_DEBUG-NOTFOUND
//Path to a library.
QT_QTCORE_LIBRARY_RELEASE:FILEPATH=/usr/lib64/qt4/lib64/libQtCore.so

(I'm compiling as Release, by the way, so I think the missing
DEBUG-stuff should not be a problem)

Any hints/ideas? I could of course hand-edit the Makefiles, but that
is not the idea behind CMake, I think.

Betreff: [Paraview] CMake finds QT but says it hasn't when compilingParaview3



Hi!

I'm having a problem when i'm trying to configure/compile the latest CVS-Version of Paraview3 on a Linux machine (Centos5 == RHEL5).

When I'm configuring with cmake (version 2.4.6) it finds the QT4, but at the end of the configuration it says

 Qt UITOOLS library not found.
 Qt GUI library not found.
 Qt XML library not found.
 Qt NETWORK library not found.
 Qt CORE library not found.

I generate the Makefiles and start compiling. It compiles without problems until it comes to the QT-stuff. There Compilation stops because the header QObject is not found. When inspecting the compiler call I find that it only uses -I/usr/lib64/qt4/include/ but not -I/usr/lib64/qt4/include/QtCore where that file is found. Completing that call with that option lets me compile that file but of course make fails with the next. 

Funny thing is CMakeCache.txt (and ccmake) both show me, that they know where to find QtCore (and all the other ''missing'' libraries):

//Path to a file. QT_QTCORE_INCLUDE_DIR:PATH=/usr/lib64/qt4/include/QtCore
//The Qt QTCORE library QT_QTCORE_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=/usr/lib64/qt4/lib64/libQtCore.so
//Path to a library. QT_QTCORE_LIBRARY_DEBUG:FILEPATH=QT_QTCORE_LIBRARY_DEBUG-NOTFOUND
//Path to a library. QT_QTCORE_LIBRARY_RELEASE:FILEPATH=/usr/lib64/qt4/lib64/libQtCore.so

(I'm compiling as Release, by the way, so I think the missing DEBUG-stuff should not be a problem)

Any hints/ideas? I could of course hand-edit the Makefiles, but that is not the idea behind CMake, I think. _______________________________________________

Here it comes (didn't post it in the original message, because I
didn't want to bloat it too much).

BTW: I'm using the binary-QT4 pulled via yum from the
CentOS-Repositories (packages: qt4, qt4-devel, qt4-doc). I'm just
mentioning this because when compiling Paraview3 on a Mac (see
postings last week) there seemed to be a problem when one did NOT
compile QT from the sources.

BTW2: I'm on a x86_64-architecture

Message-ID: <d3d4ab920705150914h63c87d41n7f683655bde66251@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I am trying to compile ParaView3 (latest CVS version) entirely without
QT depended parts.

I set the "PARAVIEW_BUILD_QT_GUI" cmake variable to "OFF" but still
getting error message "Qt GUI library not found".

Am I missing something? Is it even possible to build ParaView without
Qt in the first place? I intend to use the ParaView Python (pvpython)
interpreter only.

Thanks for any hints,
Milan.

This may be a bug. We'll look at this after the 3.0 release.

Turn the VTK_USE_QVTK variable off.  Turning PARAVIEW_BUILD_QT_GUI off doesn't 
turn VTK_USE_QVTK off.

Subject: [Paraview] ParaView 3 with off-screen support
Message-ID: <a7479ce00705160015o1c85155by4192538521ae53e2@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am trying to compile ParaView 3 with support for off-screen rendering. I
use Mesa 6.4.2 and a CVS version of ParaView3 that is about 3 days old. I
have compiled the mangled mesa. In ccmake, I have set:

 MANGLED_MESA_INCLUDE_DIR         /opt/Mesa-6.4.2/include
 MANGLED_MESA_LIBRARY             /opt/Mesa-6.4.2/lib/libMGL.a
 MANGLED_OSMESA_INCLUDE_DIR      /opt/Mesa-6.4.2/include
 MANGLED_OSMESA_LIBRARY           /opt/Mesa-6.4.2/lib/libMOSMesa.a
 VTK_USE_MANGLED_MESA             ON

Some compilation errors arise:

Can somebody please help me? Is it still possible to use offscreen rendering
with ParaView?

Many thanks,

Do not use mangled mesa as pointed out by John. The complete set of 
flags which works well for me is the following.
I do NOT set VTK_USE_OFFSCREEN .

OPENGL_INCLUDE_DIR                      /apps/Mesa-6.5.1/include
OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY                          /apps/Mesa-6.5.1/lib/libGL.so

Hi Mike,

I don't a whole lot about the install issues with VS2005 either, but I 
had a conversation with one of my colleagues where I found out that the 
CMake folks have figured out how to redistribute things built with VS 
2005 if it's a release build (and have incorporated this functionality 
into CPack). For some reason it's different with a debug build, and he's 
wasn't even sure it was possible. Is it possible for you to use CPack to 
create an installer executable, and then run the installer on that server?

John, Jean,

thanks a lot for your help. I re-compiled ParaView 3 as suggested, but now I
am a bit lost on how to produce images off-screen... Basically, my goal is
to produce images in batch without opening the ParaView window (and without
having a DISPLAY). Do you think that this is possible? Is there an example
somewhere?

Thanks,

Cool. (also poor paraview 2)

I don't think there is. You have to import it every time. I will add a
feature request in the bug tracker for this. It is a very useful
feature.

Are you running client/server? Do you want paraview to render
offscreen only on the server side? Can you describe in more detail
what you are trying to do?

Hi Berk,

what I am trying to do is to produce images without opening the graphical
display. That is, to have a script that reads a file, creates some filters,
then saves the result in as picture (say, PNG). Ideally, this will be done
from a web server (installed on the same machine as paraview): the wwwrun
user will launch the script, generate the files, then post them on a web
page. Is it possible? Maybe in VTK? A simple example would really help me...

Thanks,
-Marzio

Sure I can run CPack. I tried running CPack -G ZIP on a windows XP  
machine and I get the error that ZIP cannot be found, which is what I  
thought would happen. I did get the Compressed Tar option to work  
though. My problem now is I am not sure if my customers system will  
have anything that understands the tar.z file. The computer systems  
are locked down extremely tight so I can only count on what comes  
Native with Windows XP SP2. Is there a Zip package that you recommend  
I put on my own system so that I can generate a .zip package?

Thanks for the help.

Hi Mike,

I use WinZip 9.0 and NSIS (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Main_Page) to 
create installer executables on Windows. If you create an installer 
rather than a Zip file, then you don't have to count on your customers 
even being able to open a .zip file. I can't give you instructions on 
creating an installer executable using these tools with CPack, but I 
know it can be done.

Very nice idea! My vote is to add it as a color-map option starting in 
PV Version 3.0.

OK. I am extremely confused. I think you are going down the wrong
path. You cannot use cpack with ParaView 2. Only ParaView 3 supports
it. The possible solution to this problem are:
* Compile with visual studio 2003
* Install vcredist_x86.exe on the target computer
(http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=32bc1bee-a3f9-4c13-9c99-220b62a191ee&displaylang=en)
* Manually copy the manifest files (I have no ideas how)
* Follow Bill Hoffman's instructions from the cmake mailing list:
   Add INCLUDE(InstallRequiredSystemLibraries) to the top
CMakeLists.txt file in ParaView. I did not test this so I am not sure
it will work.

ParaView 3 does not have this problem (although it has other problems
with distributing Qt and Python).

I chose to reinstall VS 2003. None of the other options are, well,  
options given my customers environment. I pretty much need a drag and  
drop install. Compiling with VS2003 and using the "INSTALL" project  
in "Release" mode gives me what I need.

Thanks everyone for the help

Dear all,

I would be grateful if anybody can provide me the format for the
visualization of finite element data in paraview, say 8 noded quadrilateral
meshes with scalar values at each nodes.

Welcome to the club! In general the steps are:

1) Get the data into the vis application
2) Decide what you want to find out about the data
3) Pick the visualization method that works with 1 and 2

At what stage are you? Does your FE program produce data in one of the formats 
understood by ParaView (see web page for a list of formats)?

My 2 cents tips.

If you want to use VTK file format, I think you have to use the vtkUnstructuredGrid format (see http://www.*vtk*.org/pdf/*file*-*format*s.pdf) wich has the vtkHexahedron cell type.

Fred, aren't there FE programs that use structured grids? Vis programs in 
general run a little faster if structured grids can be used. Of course, if the 
FE applicaton already writes a format that PV understands that would be the 
best of all.

Yes, but SG does not implement cells type (unlike UG) if the OP want them.
That's all I wanted to say.

Message-ID: <e8289c090705171121v264d1fb9i2dfa84438b24c5c3@mail.gmail.com>

hi,

apologies if this has been posted, but i did not find it when
looking quickly.

i have a uniform rectilinear grid, loaded as a legacy vtk
format, and i am trying to use the "volume" representation
to see the data.  when i select the "volume" option, all that
happens is the outline disappears (i.e. nothing is rendered

Hi Bryan,

Which version of ParaView? Can you share an example dataset?

Subject: [Paraview] CAVE configuration
Message-ID: <464CA362.5070201@vt.edu>

According to the FAQ for specifying cave parameters in ParaView 2.2 ad 
later:

The "<Machine ..." lines are repeated for each machine involved in 
rendering in the cave (with the Name, Environment, LowerLeft, 
LowerRight, and UpperLeft entries changed to reflect the appropriate 
values for each machine).

We are using ParaView-2.6.1. I configured 4 machines (one for each wall 
of our CAVE) and the pvserver segfaults when the pvclient is started. If 
I specify only 1 server machine it works as I expect. Is there something 
special I need to do in order to display on multiple walls?

My current .pvx file is:

<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<pvx>
  <Process Type="client" />
  <Process Type="server">
   <Machine Name="wall_1"
            Environment="DISPLAY=wall_1:0.0"
            LowerLeft="-1.0 -1.0 -1.0"
            LowerRight="1.0 -1.0 -1.0"
            UpperLeft="-1.0  1.0 -1.0" />
   <Machine Name="wall_2"
            Environment="DISPLAY=wall_2:0.0"
            LowerLeft="-1.0 -1.0 -1.0"
            LowerRight="1.0 -1.0 -1.0"
            UpperLeft="-1.0  1.0 -1.0" />
  </Process>
</pvx>

I rebuilt ParaView against Mesa-6.4.2, and ParaView no longer crashes,
the saved image exists, and looks correct. Just to be thorough the CMake
Initial Cache has :

VTK_OPENGL_HAS_OSMESA:BOOL=ON
VTK_USE_OFFSCREEN:BOOL=ON

and I think I've found before that VTK_USE_OFFSCREEN had something to do
with it.

How should I proceed? Should I rebuild ParaView with Mesa from between
6.4.2 and now?

Subject: [Paraview] External Surface and Cell Blanking
Message-ID: <464CC9BA.9080302@psc.edu>

I have a reader producing vtkStructuredGrid data with cell blanking that 
operates as expected with a cut. However, the external surface module always 
shows everything w/out respect for the blanking. This is a large, transient 
data set so I'd rather not use Threshold which converts it all to an 
unstructured grid.

Should the external surface module honor blanking? Is there a nice summary of 
which ParaView/VTK filters honor node and/or cell blanking?

Most of the blanked cells are in groups around the edges. I could figure out 
which nodes are never used and also set node blanking. Would that help?

TIA

Message-ID: <200705181402.12112.martin.kuettler@gmx.de>

Hello,

I am using Paraview to read Ensight Golf files with multiple time steps and a 
static geometry. But I have not yet found a way to tell Paraview that the 
geometry is static, so I am writing the geometry data for every time step.
Is it possible to write variable data for every time step, but geometry only 
once?

Hi Martin,

You should be able to specify this in your EnSight case file; the 
EnSight file format certainly handles the case where the geometry is 
static and the variables change over time. The EnSight reader in 
ParaView should correctly read such a dataset without you having to 
explicitly tell ParaView that this is the case. If you find that this 
does not work in ParaView, please post a small dataset that demonstrates 
this problem, and I'll be happy to look into it.

The correct syntax for a single geometry file and multiple transient 
solution files would be the following for 10 steps:

# Ensight formatted case file for dataset
FORMAT
type: ensight gold
GEOMETRY
model:                   position000001.geo

VARIABLE
scalar per node:  1  pressure    pressure.******.dat
TIME
time set:              1
number of steps:     10
filename start number:    1
filename increment:     1
time values:
   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

I'm thinking about using a data-server / render-server architecture for 
visualization on Blue Gene.    I've been fiddling with a BG port - its a 
bit problematic for several reasons - its necessarily a cross-compile and 
all linking must be done statically - and right now its foundering on a 
lack of X11 libraries.   Does anyone know if its possible to build a data 
server without X11 libs?  Or, if not, whether a data server built with 
stubbed X11 might be made to work?

Hi Greg,

I don't think you can build the data server without X11. We haven't
separated the data server from the rendering libraries that well.
However, if you build against a stubbed X11, it should work. If the
data server tries to make an X connection for some reason, it is a bug
that we should fix.

I'm trying to compile paraView 3 with MPI & OSMesa support for some
client-server testing, but I'm running into the following problem late in
the compile:


/viz/home/rhand/src/PV3/build/Utilities/VTKClientServer/Xdmf/vtkXdmfReaderClientServer.cxx:

I used the instructions on the Website for obtaining source from CVS (i
didn't see a source tarball).  is CVS broken at the moment?  A CVS update
didn't fix this.

The bold part is the offending portion.  The vtkXdmfReader.h file existing
in the source tree, but before that it also exists in the
/viz/home/rhand/local/include from a separate install I made of the Xdmf
reader for other VTK-only code I've written.  I moved the files into another
directory (temporarily) and the compile linked against the correct ones in
the Source Tree.  Any way this can be fixed in CMake?

To: Paraview List <paraview@paraview.org>

I'm trying to compile paraView 3 with MPI & OSMesa support for some
client-server testing, but I'm running into the following problem late in
the compile:


/viz/home/rhand/src/PV3/build/Utilities/VTKClientServer/Xdmf/vtkXdmfReaderClientServer.cxx:
In function `int vtkXdmfReaderCommand(vtkClientServerInterpreter*,
vtkObjectBase*, const char*, const vtkClientServerStream&,

Error 1
gmake[2]: *** Waiting for unfinished jobs....


I used the instructions on the Website for obtaining source from CVS (i
didn't see a source tarball).  is CVS broken at the moment?  A CVS update
didn't fix this.

Message-ID: <46521363.8020907@lanl.gov>

It seems the calculator can accept a function for the second argument of 
min or max but not for the first.

For example, on Source->Wavelet, min(2,3) yields 2 on the field, and 
min(2,sqrt(9)) also yields 2. But min(sqrt(4),3) results in an error:

I have encountered two problems with ParaView 3.0 Beta:

1. Legacy VTK time series data does not play correctly in 3.0 beta, while is
does work in 2.4.4 and 2.6.1.
2. The PLY reader does not read in RGB colors correctly (or perhaps it reads
correctly but does not display it correctly).  It does work in 2.4.4 and
2.6.1.

Hello,

I am wondering if the "Measure Polygons per second" feature (it was in 3D view properties, general, measurements, in Paraview 2.6) has been implemented in Paraview 3.0 ?

If yes, where can I find it ?

If not, is it envisaged to do it before the release ?

Regards,

Jerome

I was hoping this wouldn't come up this quickly. This is not supported
in 3.0. We will support it in either 3.2 (to be released in August) or
3.4 (to be release in the fall).

> 2. The PLY reader does not read in RGB colors correctly (or perhaps it reads

We'll look into this. Is there an example file we can try?

Unfortunately, no. We don't have immediate plans to support this in ParaView 3.

Are time series working with the xml file formats, e.g. .vtu ?
And, if yes, has anyone already created a converter from legacy files?

If you mean vtk to vtu for example, the answer is yes.
Prabhu wrote it as vtk2xml.py.

Note that once you convert legacy files to xml files, you have to
write a pvd file that points to them to read them as time series. I
can provide more information if necessary.

Dear all,
I was trying to display VTK  non-linear cells. I used the following simple
data for VTK_QUADRATIC_QUAD type of cell:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# vtk DataFile Version 2.0
Unstructured Grid Example
ASCII

DATASET UNSTRUCTURED_GRID
POINTS 8 float
0.0 0.0 0.0
5.0 0.0 0.0
10.0 0.0 0.0
10.0 5.0 0.0
10.0 10.0 0.0
5.0 10.0 0.0
0.0 10.0 0.0
0.0 5.0 0.0

CELLS 1 9
8 0 2 4 6 1 3 5 7

CELL_TYPES 1
23
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When I use the wireframe of surface for display, I get the triangles instead
of single quadrilateral. Is it not possible to display such non-linear cells
in paraview? I would appreciate your help.

Sincerely,
Hom NathGharti

After applying the extract surface filter, you can write the data
(File->Save Data) as any polygonal data file format paraview supports
(legacy vtk (.vtk), xml vtk (.vtp), pvd, vrml (.wrl) and a few
others). Make sure the extract surface filter is selected when you
save.

run a python script on the extracted surface. Something like

pdi = self.GetInput()
nbp = pdi.GetNumberOfPoints()
pts = pdi.GetPoints().GetData()
for i in range(0,nbp):
  print "%5f %5f %5f" % (pts.GetTuple3(i)[0],pts.GetTuple3(i)[1],pts.GetTuple1(i)[2])

Worked fine except that the file is in a data format. What I wanted was 
the ascii coordinates to enter into a time series computing code in 
order to save the solutions only on the extracted plane (small number of 
points). Is there a way to save the data in a readable format?

We will eventually add a way of specifying whether you want to write
vtk files as binary or ascii. Currently, vrml is the only format that
will produce ascii, I believe. It would also be easy to write a vtk
python script that reads a vtk file and prints the results in human
readable form.

Hi Greg,

It sounds like the reader is producing multiple outputs to simulate
multiple blocks. As of 2.6, this behavior was deprecated and was
replaced with native multi-block datasets (yes, we are behind OpenDX
in multi-block support by quite a few years). Multi-block (composite)
datasets are discussed in the November 2006 issue of Kitware Source
(http://www.kitware.com/products/newsletter.html) in more detail.
Which reader are you using? The OpenFOAM reader that is in ParaView
2.6 does produce multi-block output so it should work properly.

I'm using the reader that is included in OpenFOAM v. 1.4.  Didn't know 
there was one provided with PV; I'll try it.

OK, I'm stuck.  I unset my PV_INTERFACE_FILE environment variable so that 
(as I understand things) it'd use the built-in OpenFoam reader, rather 
than the one I built from source in the OpenFOAM release.   Then I ran

paraFoam {root} {case}

and got:

ErrorMessage
# Error or warning: There was a VTK Error in file: 
/dcv/gabra/local/src/ParaView-2.6.1/GUI/Client/vtkPVWindow.cxx (2572)

specified. This probably means that the reader for the file with name: 
./hotRoom.foam cannot be found
ErrorMessage end 
ErrorMessage

 vtkPVApplication (0x47f9960):
    Script: 
paraFoam.pvs
    Returned Error on line 11:
      invalid command name ""
ErrorMessage end

So I look at the paraFoam script.  It creates a paraFoam.pvs file and 
touches {case}.foam, then runs 

paraview paraFoam.pvs

So I touch {case}.foam and then just run PV.   I do File->Open Data, and 
sure enough, there in the Files of type: list is OpenFoam Files (*.foam). 
so it knows *something* about OpenFOAM files.  So I try to load the 
{case}.foam file, and get:

ErrorMessage
# Error or warning: There was a VTK Error in file: 
/dcv/gabra/local/src/ParaView-2.6.1/GUI/Client/vtkPVWindow.cxx (2572)

 vtkPVApplication (0x47f9960):
    Script:
paraFoam.pvs
    Returned Error on line 11:
      invalid command name ""
ErrorMessage end

So, mimicking the paraFoam.pvs file, I open the tcl window and:

set a [$Application GetMainWindow]
set b [$a InitializeCustomReader "FoamReader" "hotFoam.foam"]
$a ReadFileInformation $b "hotRoom.foam"

and get the first part of that last error:

ErrorMessage

What am I doing wrong?

Hi Greg,

There seems to be some remnants of the other OpenFOAM reader
somewhere. I tested to make sure and I can open the only .foam file I
have without problem (I would be happy to try yours). At first glance,
I can see that the .pvs script you are using has a problem. The reader
module in paraview is called OpenFOAMReader and the one in the script
is FoamReader. Replacing that should fix the script. I cannot tell why
you are getting this error when you do File->Open. Maybe the ParaView
you are using was modified? I would recommend downloading it from
paraview.org and trying it out.

Triangles are rendered because that is what the OpenGL graphics library
(and most other interactive rendering libraries) can accept as a
rendering primitive. If the triangles don't approximate the
nonlinearities in the cell very well, you can refine the approximation
using the "Tessellate" filter in ParaView. If you choose to do this, you
may want to run "Clean to Grid" afterwards as it will help with
rendering speed.

Uh-oh. I am afraid you cannot do it. The Xdmf reader does not publish
this information in a way ParaView can read.

Berk,

     Thank you for the info.  I'll just indicate the time step size,
along with the iteration count on each frame.

Hi,

I'm having trouble with both the Mac and Linux x86_64 paraview v3  
binaries. After loading a structured points data set none of the  
visualization algorithms (contour, clip, slice, etc are enabled). I  
can display an outline, volume render, etc,. but that's all. Maybe  
i'm doing something really stupid, but i've tried just about every  
button I can find and I can't seem to enable the icons for these  
functions. Any enlightenment would be greatly appreciated.

Subject: [Paraview] Looking for AMR data
Message-ID: <465517F5.3030201@kitware.com>

Hello,

We currently have two interns at Kitware who are working on an 
NSF-funded "Research Experience for Undergraduates" (REU) project 
related to our SBIR on visualizing Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) data. 
The goal of their project is to apply the AMR visualization techniques 
that we are developing to some "real world" data - creating images, 
animations, small demo applications, and a case-study report.

Kitware is seeking researchers with AMR data who are willing to provide 
some example data for use in this project. In exchange, you will receive 
copies of all images, animations, demo applications and reports 
generated using your data. You will have early access to these new 
visualization algorithms (before they become part of VTK / ParaView), 
and you will help ensure that when these algorithms are released they 
will work well with your data.

If you are interested in contributing data, or would like more 
information on the project, please send email to Lisa Avila at 
lisa.avila@kitware.com.

Thank you,

Lisa

Hello again,

Oops - it seems that I forgot to specify the "type" of AMR data we are 
looking for - the main focus of this project is AMR data defined on a 
regular rectilinear 3D grid. Actually, our code doesn't really require a 
"pure" AMR structure - anything that is hierarchical and based on a 
regular rectilinear grid (each block can be defined as a vtkImageData) 
would be fine.

For ParaView 2.6.0, could someone please explain how to create a line of
text (i.e., annotation) that can be arbitrarily positioned (and scaled)
within a frame?  Using the corner annotation blocks (under 3D View
Properties) is somewhat restrictive, as far as controlling the position
and size of the text.  Thanks.

Other than using the 3D text source, you can't. We implemented this

Message-ID: <90BD7498-DD23-4C91-BBE9-006B1446C10C@utep.edu>

I am using paraview 2.9.6 on os x.  I am reading in data in  
ensight*.case format.  I am curious how to produce animations.  It  
seems that only one timestep is loaded at a time. I can change the  
timestep viewed by modifying the Set Time Value field in the Object  
inspector window so it seems that the file format is valid.  But how  
do I load all the time steps so that I can animate?  Is there some  
syntax in the Set Time Value field so that this can be done?

You cannot do this in 2.9.6 but you can in 3.0 beta. In 3.0.0 (beta)
or 3.0.1 (release), you should be able to open you file and hit play.
I believe there is some documentation about animation under
Help->Help. If it is not in beta, it will be in 3.0.1. The binaries
for that are actually available as well (under
http://paraview.org/v3.0/files/) but I didn't have time to update the
web page yet. Some detailed release notes
(http://paraview.org/New/release.html) can be found in the soon-to-be
paraview pages (http://paraview.org/New). Please note that these pages
are beta and will replace the previous pages next week.

Hi,

a lot of colleagues use powerviz/powerflow for interactive

Is there a chance that paraview can do that? By the way, did anybody

Not without some effort. You have to use the python scripting engine
to do this. It would require:
* Fetching the streamlines from the server
* Moving the camera along one of the polylines (streamlines)

Thanks! Python sounds good for me, but unfortunately I do not find a
lot paraview python resources (just those two pages
in the wiki). Maybe there exist a paraview python book yet? I would
love to use python more in paraview, but
it seems quite hard ...

Hi Berk,

powerviz is the post-processing 'add-on' for powerflow calculations.
It can visualize streamlines interactive in almost 'real time';
which means, that you can move the seeding position with the mouse
or some slide bar in your display and take a look at the lines just
like in a wind tunnel with a smoking lance. In powerviz the seeding
type is of rectangle source with a defined amount of seeding points.
For a case with about  40 Miollion Cells your able to move about 100
lines in almost 'real time'...

Best Regards!
Fabian

Subject: [Paraview] Crash in animation with paraview III
Message-ID: <web-191083269@infinito.it>

Hi all,
I am very happy for the new 3.0.1 release of Paraview, it 
is a big step in future respect the 2.6 version... but I 
have a problem; I am not sure how one can create an 
animation with paraview III (the "time step" button in the 
source editor (parameter) is missing), but I do the 
following sequence: I open a vtk file in a folder with a 
lot of other vtk files; then, in the "animation 
inspector", I add a key frame (property to animate= file 
name); when I push the play button paraview crash with the 
message "Segmentation fault (core dumped)". I know that 
probably this sequence doesn't create any animation 
(someone can tell me the correct sequece?), but the crash 
is unexpected...
I am using paraview-3.0.1-linux-x86_em64 on a single 
processor
workstation (amd64 3800+ with 2 GB of ram).

Hi all,

I have exactly the same problem with paraview-3.0.1 for windows.
In the Paraview release you talk about link between animation and time.
But How we must write the time in a vtk or vtu file ?

Thanks for your help.

Subject: [Paraview] Files continuation in Ensight Gold Format
Message-ID: <200705291343.49619.martin.kuettler@gmx.de>

Hello

I wondered whether Paraview can handle Ensight Gold filesets with continuation 
files for variables. When I tried it ens_checker accepted my files, but both 
Paraview 2.6 and 3.0 quit with a segmentation fault.
My casefile looks like this:

FORMAT
type:	ensight gold

GEOMETRY
model:	1	1	model.geo

VARIABLE

vector per node:	1	2	v_per_node	v_per_node.dat*

TIME

time set:				1
number of steps:		3
time values: 0.0 0.5 1.0

FILE

file set:				1
number of steps:		3

file set:				2
filename index:		1
number of steps:		2
filename index:		2
number of steps:		1

Did I make a mistake or is this a problem of Paraview?

Subject: [Paraview] Building a PlugIn for v3 for an existing Reader
	(OpenFOAM)
Message-ID: <871wgzzp9d.fsf@workstation001.office.ice-sf.at>


Hi!

I'm trying to include the reader found in

VTK/IO/vtkOpenFOAMReader.cxx

into the Paraview3-GUI with a PlugIn. I'm using two sources of
information:

1. http://paraview.org/Wiki/Plugin_HowTo
2. Examples/Plugins/GUIReader from the PAraview-Sources

To me they seem to contradict each other. 1 says that I need a
server-Plugin as well in 2 (and the neighbouring directories) I see no
trace for that. From 2 I derived this:

CMakeLists.txt:

FIND_PACKAGE(ParaView REQUIRED)
INCLUDE(${PARAVIEW_USE_FILE})
ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN(OpenFOAMGUIPlugin "1.0" 
                    GUI_RESOURCE foamReader.qrc )

foamReader.qrc:

<RCC>
    <qresource prefix="/ParaViewResources" >
        <file>foamReader.xml</file>
    </qresource>
</RCC>

foamReader.xml:

<ParaViewReaders>
  <Reader name="OpenFOAMReader"
          extensions="controlDict foam"
          file_description="OpenFOAM Files">
  </Reader>
</ParaViewReaders>


When I run ccmake on this I get this message when configuring:

 You have called ADD_LIBRARY for library OpenFOAMGUIPlugin without any source
 files. This typically indicates a problem with your CMakeLists.txt file

Compiling generates nothing. 

Am I missing something embarrasingly obvious? Or did I misunderstand
something?

Bernhard

PS: I also tried adding this to CMakeLists.txt

ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN(OpenFOAMSMPlugin "1.0" 
                    SERVER_MANAGER_XML foamReader.xml
                    SERVER_MANAGER_SOURCES /path/to/ParaView3/VTK/IO/vtkOpenFOAMReader.cxx)

This generates a .so (although the XML-File is not correct I think)
that loads into paraview but I guess I need the GUI-Plugin to see it
in the File-Open-dialog.

Hi Stefano,

Unfortunately, you cannot animate a file series directly in 3.0 as you
could in 2.6. We will add this feature back in 3.2. Having said that,
the crash is a bug. The file name track should not be there in the
first place. We will fix that in the next patch release.

You can animate file series of XML-based vtk files (.vtu .vtp .pvu
.pvtp etc...) by writing a simple .pvd wrapper file. The pvd file
would look like this:

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<VTKFile type="Collection" version="0.1" byte_order="LittleEndian"
compressor="vtkZLibData
Compressor">
  <Collection>
    <DataSet timestep="0"  file="file1.vtp"/>
    <DataSet timestep="1"  file="file2.vtp"/>
    <DataSet timestep="2"  file="file3.vtp"/>
  </Collection>
</VTKFile>

Note that timestep is actually a floating point number so you can
associate any time value with a timestep. This value can then be
displayed through the time annotation source.

The server side OpenFOAM stuff is already built into ParaView.
You just need a GUI side plugin.
There was a typo on the Wiki that is now fixed.
Use GUI_RESOURCES instead of GUI_RESOURCE

FIND_PACKAGE(ParaView REQUIRED)
INCLUDE(${PARAVIEW_USE_FILE})
ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN(OpenFOAMGUIPlugin "1.0" 
                    GUI_RESOURCES foamReader.qrc )

Hi Martin,

I don't see anything wrong with your case file. I tried it out in the 
EnSight reader in ParaView 3.0, and it successfully read the case file. 
(I stepped through reading the case file in a debugger; I stopped before 
it got to the point of trying to read the geometry and variable files.) 
Is it possible for you to send a simple dataset that exhibits this 
problem? I am happy to look into it, but it is rather difficult without 
having a dataset to test with.

I believe Clint will respond to your message. By the way, the absence
of the OpenFOAM reader in the default list of readers is not
intentional. I will put it in for the next patch.

Hi Martin,

Thanks for sending me the sample data files. I was able to track down 
and fix the problem. It's checked into the main development branch of 
ParaView 3 and into the branch for ParaView 3.0. It will be included in 
the next patch release of ParaView 3.0.

Subject: [Paraview] Trouble making stream traces
Message-ID: <1180465048.5092.5.camel@s885697.sandia.gov>

I'm having trouble creating stream traces on a data set that I
generated...it seems no matter what parameters I choose, I can't get
more than a fraction of the domain swept.  Could somebody take a look at
my dataset and see if there is something obviously wrong with it (I
generate the vtu XML file myself, from inside a fortran code), or how I
can get stream traces?

Hi John,
   I too have found the stream traces filter hard. While I have not 
figured it all out it seems most of the troubles I have had were related 
to bad cell connectivity in the data set. I took your data and made a 
little picture with stream traces. To get it to work I had to first run 
through the "tetrahedralize" filter. I believe that doing this fixes the 
internal cell connectivities. I am sure someone from KiteWare can give a 
real answer to what it is really doing. I hope this helps:

Last year I worked with a dataset that had similar problems but with a 
slightly different cause. It turned out that many vertices that should 
have been shared between adjacent cells were actually two vertices close 
together. As a result the very thin, almost invisible gap between the 
cells halted the streamline algorithm (it thought it had reached the end 
of the dataset). One of the filters (I think it was clean-to-grid) took 
care of most of this but eventually we had to fix the application that 
generated the mesh.

Great. Just one thing I noticed: OpenFOAM has the option to write the
data files (and the grid files) compressed (a data file p becomes p.gz
and has the same format, but is (SURPRISE) gnuzipped). If I open such
a case then paraview seems to go into an infinite loop and allocates
memory until it crashes because no more mem is available). If I unzip
the files before reading the case, everything is OK.

>From looking at the source of vtkOpenFOAMReader I'm not quite sure
whether these zipped files are recognized (it is my impression that
they are not). I think it's better not to include the reader before
this thing accounted for.

If there is any way I can help with that let me know (I'll try to
understand the sources and see whether I can come up with a fix)

Bernhard

Dan,

Thanks for putting me on the right track.  I am outputting quadratic
triangles from the code, but my code actually has quadratic
quadrilaterals (the vtk format doesn't have a 9-noded quad), so I'm sure
I've made some mistake in that connectivity code.  I didn't have this
problem when I output 4 linear quads.

Berk,

I have verified that my connectivity is correct.  I have attached a much
smaller file, only 15 nodes and 4 elements.  Still has problem doing
streamtraces.  Guess I'm gonna go back to 4xlinear quads.  Would be nice
if there was a 9-noded quad...

Hi,

I would like to prepare a figure for a publication, and thus I chose
a white background. The figure is quite "ugly" due to either missing 
antialiasing or antialiasing for another background color than white.
(NB: I have lots of tubes in the figure). Can this be improved?

Thanks in advance,

There is a 9-node quad, thanks to Soeren Gebbert:

ParaView defaults to 8x supersampled antialiasing if your hardware
supports it (and if you not in parallel rendering mode).  The background
color will have no effect on your antialiasing.

If you are sure aliasing is the problem, you could always generate a
really large image and then perform smooth downsampling (for example,
using IrfanView).  You can hackishly use the "Save Animation" option to
save an image larger than what you can display on screen.

Without seeing an image, I cannot think of anything else to suggest.

Hi all,
I've been loading EnSight Gold C Binary data into Paraview 3.0.1 (on a
linux system) but now when I want to use the filter Extract Datasets
(since I have many parts) I don't get the convenient list of groups that
appeared before (at least in version 2.4). That list should of course be
convenient also when using Extract Group. Is it possible to retrieve
this list somehow or is there something that I've missed?

Thanks,

Mattias

This is definitely good news -- does it have support in paraview, and if
so, how do I determine what element type (integer) to output from my
code?

vtkBiQuadraticQuad is 28. It should work properly in ParaView. If the
default tetrahedralization used for rendering is too coarse you can use
the "Tessellate" filter to get a better approximation to the real
quadratic geometry and scalar fields.

Well, the biquadratic element works o.k. until I try to do stream
traces.  Then paraview crashes.  *sigh*

Berk,

Here you go.  Two notes:  the procedure given by Dan Goldstein works for
getting streamtraces out of this data (first run the tetrahedralize
filter), and running the tessellate filter fails as it is not
implemented for this element type (not critical, as the only reason I
was trying it was per David's advice below).

I used Paraview 3.0.1 (prebuild and own builds) on my Opteron and our Itanium 
systems. I am mainly interested in the evaluation of large-scale datasets. 
And ParaView 2.6 was a big help. But with the new version, inputs in Qt 
control widgets yield an immediate update of my visualization even if I still 
type in some numbers. But this approach results in long waiting times during 
the setup of render properties etc. already whith smaller datasets.

Can this observer widget behavior be configured?

I want to render my unstructured grid dataset on my Opteron (Qt-4.2.3) and my

an empty screen. The some dataset on the some systems works fine with PV-2.6.

Message-ID: <e442806d6dfadc4e82d8dbb06c852078@mail.mirarco.org>

I have a custom reader (GocadReader) that was working fine in PV2.6 and
I'm trying to add it to 3.0.1

My directory structure is:

ParaView3.0.1

    Applications

    CMake

    Common

    CustomReaders

        GocadReader - with my CMakeLists.txt, GocadReader.qrc,
GocadReader.xml, GocadReader.cxx and .h

    etc.

 

CMakeLists.txt is

FIND_PACKAGE(ParaView REQUIRED)

INCLUDE(${PARAVIEW_USE_FILE})

ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN(GocadReaderGUIPlugin "1.0"

    GUI_RESOURCES GocadReader.qrc )

 

GocadReader.qrc is

<RCC>

  <qresource prefix="/ParaViewResources">

    <file>GocadReader.xml</file>

  </qresource>

</RCC>

 

GocadReader.xml is

<ParaViewReaders>

  <Reader name="GocadReader"

    extensions=".ts .pl .vs"

    file_description="Gocad ASCII Files">

  </Reader>

</ParaViewReaders>

 

I also have the GocadReaderParaViewImport.cmake from 2.6 - Is it still
needed?

 

Do I still need to identify this as an EXTERNAL_PLUGIN is CMake?
Otherwise, how do I make ParaView aware of it?

 

What am I missing?

Hi, Andreas,

we just tested the stereo feature; actually we are interested in an active 
mode too. Do you know, if ther are any plans to integrate you small changes 
into the general code; maybe in 3.x!?
Would be nice ...

Hi Berk,

it is me again :-) I hope it my last mail was more exact ...

I think powerviz is doing some workaround and is not solving any equation for 
the streamlines; otherwise they would not be as fast as they are, when moving 
the seeds points ... but if powerviz can do that, paraview would be able to 
do that too!? 
What do think?

Regards!

Hi Bob,

How did you try compiling this plugin? In ParaView 3 you don't need to add
the "PARAVIEW_EXTRA_EXTERNAL_MODULE" option to cmake. Also the
GocadReaderParaViewImport.cmake file is not needed in ParaView 3.

To compile your plug-in, you need to have your plugin files all in one
folder. If say the folder name is "BobsReader". Then you need to do the
following.

1) Go to the BobsReader folder and use "ccmake ./"(Linux) or similar
adaptation in windows.

2) Configure cmake at which point it will ask you for the location of your
build directory(first time only). Point this variable to the location of
your ParaView 3 build folder. (You should have build from source for
ParaView 3 before attempting to add the plugin)

3) Configure again and then generate. Then simply do a "make" in BobsReader
to create the libraries which will be .dll in windows and .so in linux. Then
you can load this in ParaView 3

The following link also points to similar instructions.

http://wiki.mirarco.org/index.php/Paraview_3_-_Adding_Filters

I hope this helps.

Subject: [Paraview] TIFF stacks
Message-ID: <91588B43-8BC0-4CB9-A899-8C44CA17FB4C@mit.edu>

Hello,
	I have a very simple question. What is the best way to load TIFF  
stacks into ParaView 3? There does not seem to be a reader for such  
files. Is there some easy way (on OS X, preferably) to convert such  
images into something ParaView would read?
	Apologies if this is answered elsewhere, but I could not find a  
solution.

	Thank you,
		Viren Jain

i have asked about this before as well, and i think the basic
answer was, "write a paraview reader" or something along
those lines.

if you compiled paraview with python support, i have written
a 3-d tiff reader for python that i will gladly share.  it requires
python (duh) and the python image processing library (PIL),
and numpy.  the python module reads tiff stacks into memory
as a 3-d numpy arrays.

regards,
bryan

I have a convertor that is based on ITK. You are welcome to the code.  
The command line version just needs ITK (www.itk.org) but I have a  
GUI version that needs Qt 4.2.3. You are welcome to either code set*.

put a GUI on it..

The Tessellate filter should work with VTK_BIQUADRATIC_QUAD now (CVS
head as of 2007-05-31 8:01pm PST). I tested it on your 2-cell example.
If you have any other problems please let me know.
