Subject: [Paraview] Adding a new vtkCamera
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.62.0508011154250.8427@cslab1f>

I recently created a new subclass of vtkCamera (the 
purpose of which is to add a head tracking support for 3d interactive environments) to add to a 
custom render module. I created several vtk test suites in which the new 
camera functioned very well.

However, when I added the line

Renderer -> SetActiveCaveCamera(newCamera);

where newCamera is an instance of the vtkCamera subclass I get the error:
"p0_1260:  p4_error: interrupt SIGSEGV: 11"


Does anyone have any idea of how to add a new vtkCamera to a render 
module? It seems like you should be able to arbitrarily switch cameras in 
your render module. Thanks.

Does this only work for Cave configs or will this config file also allow
a user to specify the configuration of a tiled display?  (Ie, which
machines display which part of the display?)

The assignment of machines to displays for tiled display is still 
determined by the order in which the machine names are given to MPI. 
They are still assigned the same way as when this thread 
(http://public.kitware.com/pipermail/paraview/2005-May/001514.html), 
started by you, was written previously.

Message-ID: <001001c59762$1d518c80$e603e482@jespercfnm4n5n>

Hi

I am new to ParaView, but I hope that you'll answer my question even if the answer to you seems very obvious.

I want to visualize some flows using ParaView in parallel mode using four pc's for the rendering processes and one pc to be the client. In the setup I want to use four projectors in split screen and stereo mode, such that two of the projectors cover half of the screen in stereo.

My question is, if it is possible to use ParaView for this purpose without MPI, or is MPI always needed when you want to do parallel stuff?

Thanks in advance for your answer!

You need to use MPI to run ParaView in parallel.  This requires 
building ParaView from source.

It might be possible to use Chromium to do something like this.
Otherwise, you have to run paraview with MPI.

Hello all,

I've already observed that after using the stream filter some derived
quantities, such as, vorticity, angular velocity, etc... appears in the
"Color by" drop down list in the Display tab and I was thinking if there is
any way to reuse this quantities to build plots with them. Does anybody know
if it's possible?

You can treat the output of the streamline filter like any other
dataset. This would be easier if you were dealing with 1 streamline.
The reason behind this is that the streamline filter output each
streamline (two for streamlines integrated in both directions) as a
separate polyline. Unfortunately, there is no way to plot the values
along a polyline yet.

Joel,

I am not clear where the line
"Renderer -> SetActiveCaveCamera(newCamera); " added?
You can switch cameras in a render module.
refer to vtkSMRenderModuleProxy::CreateVTKObjects(int numObjects).
In this case we have only changed the active camera on the client 
renderer. For this to work, it is essential that the renderer is created 
on the client as well. If you wanted to change the active camera on the 
render server as well, you would have to create a camera proxy on the 
servers and use a proxy property on the renderer proxy to set the active 
camera.

vtkSMCompositePartDisplay has become vtkSMCompositeDisplayProxy (since
PV2.2). Internally, when the input to vtkSMCompositeDisplayProxy is set,
the display pipeline is created which takes the input set.
vtkMPIMoveData filter is created as a part of this display pipeline, see
vtkSMCompositeDisplayProxy::SetupPipeline() and
vtkSMDataObjectDisplayProxy::SetupPipeline().

The UpdateSuppressor is created on DataServer/RenderServer/Client,
the GeometryFilter created on DataServer and the MPIMoveData filter
is created on DataServer/RenderServer/Client.

The data server pipelines can are connected to GeometryFilter directly,
since both are on data server alone. The input to MPIMoveData is
GeomtryFilter output. This is set only on the DataServer (sine
GeometryFilter is only on DataServer) (see vtkSMSourceProxy::AddInput).
The MPIMoveData makes the geom available on renderserver/client as needed.

Same is true before PV2.2, but I am not sure where the relevant code is.

part is a vtu file.I found that paraview creates 116 pipelines which
are same to do this. Pipelines which are in data server and render server
are all have vtkMPIMoveData filters.When pipelines execute, how does we differentiate
vtkMPIMoveData filters?
	Another question is how do these pipelines synchronize to display all parts 
in Paraview client?
    Hope your reply!
    Best Regards!

Let's say I have 1000 time steps in my data. How would I go about ensuring 
that the animator shows them all?

"Play Mode" = "Sequence" ensures that no animation steps are skipped. But 
the number of animation time steps, it seems, is probably well under 1000 
(given the default value of 15 for "Duration"). Thus, some of my data is 
still skipped.

It would also help to know the FPS used in "Sequence" mode.

Have you tried setting the duration to 1000?

Hi Kent,

I believe the "Duration" label can be a bit confusing when running in 
Sequence mode. In Sequence mode, Duration is not seconds, but number of 
frames. In Sequence mode, ParaView does not have the "secondary goal" of 
completing the animation within the "Duration", since duration is not a 
measure of time. There is no "hidden FPS" and when the duration is set 
to 10, exactly 10+1 (since the animation begins with 0 and ends on 10) 
animation steps will be generated.

Having said that, the "second way" you explain sounds very similar to 
what the Sequence mode already represents, except that the duration is 
not automatically set to the range of a value, but the user will have to 
set that explicitly.

I have a need for some sort of timing capability in the 
RenderWindowInteractor that ParaView uses. However, the ParaView 
Interactor (vtkPVGenericRenderWindowInteractor) does not seem to implement 
a timer. Does anyone have any ideas about putting a timer in? This seems 
like something that should be available on a basic implementation level so 
I might do it on my own local copy and if anyone else has done this 
already, I would appreciate any pointers you could give me. Thanks.

Also, currently I am working (although not very actively) on an

Message-ID: <20050805172657.D760672783@mailhost.nacad.ufrj.br>

 

I've been getting crazy with the lookmark and scalar bars behavior. It seems
that the lookmark has not been storing the scalar bar (visible or not,
sizes, position and text properties) state as it should. I have 3 views, and
of course 3 lookmarks, each one with its own properties defined for the
scalar bar but when I try to recover the views through the lookmark the
image get a mess. Scalar bar titles overlapped or absent and text colors
default (Arial, white with shadows). 

Is it a bug? What can I do to avoid this problem?

Thanks a lot

Message-ID: <20050807035914.81DCE110@lulu.it.northwestern.edu>


Hi, I just changed over from 1.6.3 (a bit behind, I know...) on both linux and Mac platforms. With
both builds (downloaded prebuilt) I came across the following error repeatably with any plain text
EnSight files I throw at it (this is done through the file-> open data dialogue):

# Error or warning: There was a VTK Error in file:
/Users/kitware/ParaViewReleaseRoot/paraview-2.2.1/VTK/IO/vtkGenericEnSightReader.cxx (408)
 Unable to open file:
/Users/davidfarrell/Code/Tahoe/Tahoe_David_5/development_benchmark_XML/bridging/LJ_3D_Wave/1
ErrorMessage end
# Error or warning: There was a VTK Warning in file:
/Users/kitware/ParaViewReleaseRoot/paraview-2.2.1/VTK/IO/vtkGenericEnSightReader.cxx (409)
 Assuming binary file.


So, first, the path that is listed in the 'unable to open file' line is not the full pathname (the
path is right, but the filename is missing) for some reason. The above was the output from the Mac
build. For the linux build I get basically the same thing, though the path to the EnSight reader is 
different (but still not the same as the install path - but I doubt that is the problem). Once the
above error is hit, nothing gets read in, and other errors follow, due to the lack of data.

Any ideas?


Thanks in advance,

Dave

I'm trying to clip a triangulated shape, which I read from a stl file. 
Using the clip filter in Paraview gives me a hollow looking shape. Now I 
would like ParaView to generate a cut surface so that the shape looks 
solid again. I know from the clipcow example in VTK that it can be done 
but wasn't able to find this function in ParaView. Is there any 
possibility to get the cut surface in ParaView?

To be more precise: I have a stl file describing the outer surface of a 
shape. I want to clip the shape and showing a solid cut surface so that 
the resulting shape looks solid again. In VTK it is possible to generate 
a triangulation of the missing parts of the shape with something like this:

// Create polygons outlining clipped areas and triangulate them to 
generate cut surface
vtkCutter *cutEdges=vtkCutter::New(); //Generate cut lines
  cutEdges->SetInput(cowNormals->GetOutput());
  cutEdges->SetCutFunction( plane);
  cutEdges->GenerateCutScalarsOn();
  cutEdges->SetValue( 0, 0.5);
vtkStripper *cutStrips=vtkStripper::New(); //Forms loops (closed 
polylines) from cutter
  cutStrips->SetInput(cutEdges->GetOutput());
  cutStrips->Update();
vtkPolyData *cutPoly=vtkPolyData::New(); //This trick defines polygons 
as polyline loop
  cutPoly->SetPoints(cutStrips->GetOutput()->GetPoints());
  cutPoly->SetPolys (cutStrips->GetOutput()->GetLines());
  vtkTriangleFilter *cutTriangles=vtkTriangleFilter::New(); 
//Triangulates the polygons to create cut surface
  cutTriangles->SetInput(cutPoly);
vtkPolyDataMapper *cutMapper=vtkPolyDataMapper::New();
  cutMapper->SetInput(cutPoly);
  cutMapper->SetInput(cutTriangles->GetOutput());

But in ParaView I didn't find an equivalent possibility. Any idea?

For any VTK objects that you need to create on the server-side, be it 
RenderServer or DataServer or both,  you need to use the ServerManager.
One simply creates a proxy and notifies it of the servers it is to be 
instantiated on (vtkSMProxy::SetServers). How to create a proxy? There's 
code for that in the GUI,
example: vtkPVProbe::CreateProperties(). Note that for 
vtkSMProxyManager::NewProxy to be successful, the proxy interface must 
be defined in the ServerManager resource files in
Servers/ServerManager/Resources/*.xml.

Additionally, the proxy interace for your "cave renderer", will have to 
support a proxy property with command="SetActiveCaveCamera".
Once that is done, and you have a camera proxy, set the proxy on the 
proxyproperty for setting the ActiveCaveCamera, and the VTK objects for the
camera will be set as the CaveCamera on VTK objects for the render(s) on 
the server(s).

Subject: [Paraview] Error Compiling 2.2.1 on Tru64
Message-ID: <5995A1EF72D2FA5EA7F275BE@harpo.psc.edu>

I'm getting an error when compiling 2.2.1 that seems to be caused by the 
generated file ncconfig.h. Here's the relevant pieces of code:

... VTK/Utilities/vtknetcdf/attr.c
   #include "nc.h"

      #include "ncconfig.h"
         ...
         /* Define to `unsigned char'  if system doesn't define.  */
         #define uchar unsigned char

      #include <sys/types.h>
         ...
         typedef unsigned char uchar_t;
         ...
         typedef uchar_t uchar;
         ................1
         Error: In this declaration, "typedef" cannot be
         combined with "unsigned". (typeconflict)

It seems that cmake doesn't see the definition of uchar in the system file 
and so it adds its own definition during the generation of ncconfig.h.

This is on our Compaq Alphaserver running Tru64 with 750 nodes. This might 
also
be relevant: "uname -a" returns "OSF1 iam764 V5.1 2650 alpha".

Suggestions? Thanks in advance!

Subject: [Paraview] version 2.2.1 EnSight reading errors - update
Message-ID: <20050809030409.D0AFDB5@lulu.it.northwestern.edu>


Hi all - I was poking around in the source, and it seems that the Ensight reader
(vtkGenericEnSightReader.cxx) does not have an entry to accept when the case file is of the
following format (just the geometry part):

FORMAT
type:	 ensight gold

GEOMETRY
model:	 1	 atom.3D.0.geo -> where this line does not have a timestep entry

so the result is that the 1 gets read in as the filename, not the actual geometry file name. A
quick fix is to just hack out the 1, but that is not an ideal solution. My question is, is this the 
proper behavior (i.e., is my file format wrong? Ensight has no problems with it, nor did the older
releases of ParaView). 


Thanks,

Dave

I would agree, that frame rate and duration don't make much sense when
in the 'sequence' mode. Perhaps, when in 'Sequence' mode, grey out
duration and frame rate as they are no longer applicable. Or better
still do not have duration and frame rate even show up when in sequence
mode. 

90% use case for Sandians:
1) Open data
2) Flip through all the time steps
3) Save animation (1 frame per time step)

Since this is the top use case it should be 'brain-dead' and no
additional options should show up unless the user switches to
'realtime'.

Please Help,

Will ParaView allow a user to right-click with a mouse (or some keypress 
value) on a displayed point in a mesh and get info on that point such as 
fill value? If not can someone please point me in the direction for 
information on how to do this (maybe by extending the source code in VTK)?

I have been looking through the VTK users list and can find no information

Well, the duration is still needed in the Sequence mode. It controls the 
number of frames in the animation. To make this interpretation clear, 
here's what I am doing:
* In sequence mode, the present "Duration" label will change to "No. of 
Frames:" and the animation will have exactly those many frames. This the 
animation will run from 0 to (no. of frames -1).
* In real time mode, the present "Duration" label will stay as Duration" 
and the animation will run for duration seconds i.e. time will go from 0 
to duration seconds.
* When the user will change the play mode, the labels (and their 
interpretation) will change accordingly.

Hi Renato,

I will soon submit a fix for the "overlapping scalar bars" problem.
However, the visibility and position of scalar bars did seem to be
recreated correctly by lookmarks for me. Can you save the lookmarks to a
file and send them to me? 

As for the text properties of the title and label, these are not saved
by ParaView's session state script, which lookmarks use to regenerate
views. I'll look into saving these as well.

Hi Eric

I've put an example in the following link:

http://www.nacad.ufrj.br/~rnelias/paraview/pl075.zip

I suggest the following procedures in order to reproduce the strange
lookmark behavior:

- In the Paraview v.2.2.1 (win32 oficial release) import the lookmark file
"example.lmk"

- Rebuild the 3 views with the Ensight case file "pl075-imix.case"

- Try to alternate between the views several times and you'll probably see
the "overlapping scalar bar" error or the scalar bar will disapear in some
views.

(I hope it will be enough to reproduce the bug...)

Message-ID: <20050810015131.0BD7572783@mailhost.nacad.ufrj.br>


Hi all,

I was thinking about a very simple question about placing an observer (or
camera) in Paraview:

Is there anyway of placing the observer according to a specified cartesian
coordinate? For instance, suppose you have your object centered in the
coordinate (0,0,0) and you wish to look this object from the coordinate
(1,1,1) (opposite side of a cubic), how do I go about doing it? Note that
it's not so trivial when you are working with camera rotations (elevation,
azimuth and roll).

Thanks for any help

Message-ID: <E27465C65ADE334994854C970C87E71B209758@w2kdc.aero-lab.it>

I'm finding that Paraview always crashes when tracing streamlines on a
large unstructured grid (>2M nodes) unless the stream lines length is
set to be very short. Furthermore, it appears that before it crashes
memory occupation almost doubles while doing the stream line
computation.
Streamlines work correctly for much smaller grids (approx 0.2M nodes).

The code is running on an Intel linux machine with 4GB, and
approximately 1-1.5GB are used to load the dataset (from ensight ascii
format) before starting stream lines tracing.

I wonder if this is a known bug or I'm doing something wrong, since I
could not find anything on the bug list.
Does anybody experienced similar problems ?

Kind regards,

Hi Richard,

Have you tried using the Pick filter?  (See attached image of the 
toolbar button.)  Change the Pick Type to Point; move your mouse over 
the point about which you wish to get information; and press the 'P' 
key.  This will cause a set of crosshairs to be displayed.  You can 
use these to fine-tune which point you want to pick.  (You can also 
type the coordinates of the desired point in the Position entry boxes 
in the Point Widget section of the Parameters tab.)  When you have 
selected the coordinates, click the Accept button, and information 
about that point will be displayed at the bottom of the Parameters tab.

Subject: [Paraview] UNIX runtime paths and VTK_USE_RPATH
Message-ID: <42FBB3F9.9090009@kitware.com>

Hello, all:

In the past if a user built ParaView or VTK with shared libraries and
did not set CMAKE_SKIP_RPATH to OFF then the installed binaries would
have rpaths pointing at the build tree.  This would cause
installations to break when the build trees were removed or updated.

It is generally not safe to install binaries that use a runtime path,
especially one that points to the build tree.  The reason rpath
support is provided by ParaView and VTK is so that shared library
builds can run in the build tree out of the box without setting any
environment variables like LD_LIBRARY_PATH.  This is very useful for
testing because dashboard scripts do not have to know how to set this
environment variable.  However, it is no good for installation.

To solve this problem for VTK we created the setting VTK_USE_RPATH.
If set to ON then rpaths will be built into the binaries, but
attempting to install produces an error message and nothing installs.
If set to OFF then rpaths will not be built into the binaries and
installation will work, but running tests requires setting of
LD_LIBRARY_PATH or similar variable in the environment.  For release
versions it defaults to OFF so that users can download and install VTK
out of the box.  For development versions (only available from CVS) it
defaults to ON so that dashboards will continue to work.

In ParaView we have another option that I'd like to discuss.  For the
ParaView 2.x binary releases on UNIX platforms I created the
KWSys/SharedForward utility.  When CMAKE_SKIP_RPATH is ON (forced now
by VTK_USE_RPATH being OFF), the paraview executables are built with a
"-real" extension on their name (like "pvserver-real").  Small
forwarding executables with the original names (like "pvserver") are
built and do not link to anything but system libraries.  These small
executables detect whether they are running from a build or install
tree, set LD_LIBRARY_PATH appropriately in the environment, and
replace themselves via "exec" with the corresponding real executable.

This design allows ParaView to run out of a build tree or any install
tree without any special environment settings.  The drawback is that
in order to run a debugger some extra effort is needed to debug the
real version of the executable.  Typically one might have to do this:

$ bin/paraview --print
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/kingb/Programs/ParaView-gcc/bin
/home/kingb/Programs/ParaView-gcc/bin/paraview-real
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/kingb/Programs/ParaView-gcc/bin
$ gdb /home/kingb/Programs/ParaView-gcc/bin/paraview-real

For this reason I have chosen to use the same default for
VTK_USE_RPATH in ParaView as I do in VTK: releases default to OFF and
development versions default to ON.  This way users can download and
install out of the box and develoers can build and debug out of the
box.  However, developers that use shared libraries have to know to
set VTK_USE_RPATH to OFF in order to install.

I'd like comments on whether the default for VTK_USE_RPATH in ParaView
should just always be OFF.  Thanks to the KWSys/SharedForward feature
this choice will not require anyone to set any environment variables
unless they want to run ParaView in a debugger.  However, running in
the debugger may be a pain as described above.

Comments?

gentle para-people,

 

thanks to berk is found what was killing a recent (last week and today's) cvs
paraview build to die

right out of the gate on my WinXP machine. it was the lookmark stuff.

 

see http://public.kitware.com/pipermail/paraview/2005-July/001757.html

 

 

this is still a problem for me (and perhaps other para-heads  -- with
apologies to jimmy buffet fans)

 

the reason seems to be a collision between our security policy and the
assumptions the lookmark

developers have made.  I can build and use today's cvs just fine at home
where I have admin priviledges;

and our draconian security policies aren't strictly adhered to;

but the security policy at work does not allow me ( a generic, non-admin
user)  to write files on say c:\

 

I tracked down the offending stuff and exorcised it so paraview will fire up
and run;

but that sucks (because I'm lazy) and I will have to do this every time I
checkout

a new cvs version.  

 

perhaps the developers could put a chunk of code that checks for some
environment variable

PARAVIEW_LOOKMARKS and if it's present do stuff there; if it's not do what it
current does.

Subject: [Paraview] Stereo view in ParaView (ice-T)
Message-ID: <2146.130.225.254.34.1123837487.squirrel@webmail1.b-one.nu>

Hi

I have a problem enabling stereo in paraview. My setup is parallel with
four server machines and one client machine. The result I want is a
splitted screen with stereo (ICE-T), but I can't figure out how to get the
stereo-view.

I'm running windows and use MPICH for the communication. I have the
following three files

"pvcall.bat"  (starts up the four servers and the client when ready)
-------------
start mpirun -localroot pvserv.txt
pause
start mpirun -localroot pvcli.txt



"pvserv.txt"    (Runs pvserver.exe on the four servers, setting the
client-host and the portnumber. VR01-VR04 are the names of the machines,
Vr00 is the client)
-------------
hosts
vr01 \\Vr00\vr00-c\maskinakustik\paraviewMPI\bin\release\pvserver.exe
-ch=vr00 -sp=38138
vr03 \\Vr00\vr00-c\maskinakustik\paraviewMPI\bin\release\pvserver.exe
-ch=vr00 -sp=38138
vr02 \\Vr00\vr00-c\maskinakustik\paraviewMPI\bin\release\pvserver.exe
-ch=vr00 -sp=38138
vr04 \\Vr00\vr00-c\maskinakustik\paraviewMPI\bin\release\pvserver.exe
-ch=vr00 -sp=38138


"pvcli.txt"
-------------
hosts
vr00 1 \\Vr00\vr00-c\maskinakustik\paraviewMPI\bin\release\pvclient.exe
-sh=vr01 -sp=38138 --render-module=IceTRenderModule -tdx=2 -tdy=1


Notice that the server host is only set to vr01, as the machinefile has
been made depreciated, I don't know how to deal with this.
Does anyone know how to achieve the stereo view?

I really appreciate all the hints you can give me.

Thanks!!!

Subject: [Paraview] Stream lines crash on large dataset
Message-ID: <IL4M31$616604F21E48D948D51499641E7DB8AA@libero.it>

I have to reduce max steps down to 100-200 and keep max length to less than 1/20th of the domain length to avoid crash.
I usually tried with RK2 and initial length set to 0.5 of cell length. Other combinations do not appear to improve.
Sometimes the code does not crash but simple "freeze"after some times: CPU load is down to zero and no stream line is drawn.

The same behaviour was present in version 1.8.5 as well as 2.0, 2.2.0 and now 2.2.1

One extra remark: the uppercase ".CASE" extension is not recognized, despite appearing in the list of extensions in the open data dialog; however the lowercase extension works fine.

Kind regards,

	Luca Gasparini

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview crashing after tetrahedralizing mesh for volume
	visualization - bus error on IRIX 6.5 and latest stable ParaView
Message-ID: <2E050D13A18B3C4CA35CAC71065E4EA20FA9BA@1upmc-msx15.acct.upmchs.net>

Dear Listers -

I've been trying to visualize a relatively large (1.4 million), unstructured, mixed cell grid (tets, pyramids, and hexs) in ParaView.  When attempting volume visualization, the UI reports that vtkDatasetTriangleFilter is called and executed on the dataset.  However, errors are then reported as follows:
...
ErrorMessage
# Error or warning: There was a VTK Error in file: /opt/ParaView/VTK/VolumeRendering/vtkProjectedTetrahedraMapper.cxx (239)
 Encountered non-tetrahedra cell!
ErrorMessage end
...

and then ParaView dies with a bus error.

Do others experience this problem as well?  After reading the docs it sounds like the triangulation / tetrahedralization filters could be affected by grid quality (i.e., large aspect ratio cells) and I was wondering how I could check to see if this was indeed my problem and how I might be able to circumvent it - perhaps call a different algorithm?.  As always, your comments / suggestions are most welcome.

Message-ID: <2E050D13A18B3C4CA35CAC71065E4EA20FA9BB@1upmc-msx15.acct.upmchs.net>

Dear ParaView List -

I've been attempting to debug the problem I have been having with ParaView crashing when trying to volume visualize large grids; unfortunately I'm ending up with more questions than answers :)

I am creating a mesh within GAMBIT, running a simulation in FLUENT and then exporting the data in Ensight Gold format. I remeshed the original geometry with all tetrahedrons and then imported the dataset into ParaView; however, the same error (non-tetrahedral cell encountered) occurred and ParaView died shortly thereafter with the same error as before (bus error).  After reading through the docs for vtkProjectedTetrahedraMapper, I was wondering if the bus error indicates a problem interfacing with the SGI graphics board with openGL - could a non-tet cell cause a bus error in this situation? Is it possible to select an alternate volume visualization method for ParaView to use other than vtkProjectedTetrahedraMapper?

I noticed ParaView ran vtkDatasetTriangleFilter on the data even though it was all tets / tris at the beginning. Does ParaView always call vtkDatasetTriangleFilter for all grids no matter what cell types are present prior to volume visualization? Can it be turned off if ones knows the cells are all tets? 

Thanks for any suggestions / advice that can be provided.  I know other folks on the list use ParaView to postprocess CFD jobs run in FLUENT and I would be interested to hear if you have experienced the same or similar issues.

Best regards -
Ken

My apologies if this question has been previously asked and answered. But I searched in the archive and could not find it anywhere...

I want to use an xml-file to specify which nodes are render-servers, data-servers and so on. As I understand the xml-file is a new way of specifying things which earlier could be specified in the machinesfile, which could be used with the -m command for the client. However, this function has been made depreciated. How do I call ParaView with the new fileformat?

Message-ID: <4300A4E9.40803@poczta.onet.pl>


I've been trying to use a Scale widget in my reader in ParaView CVS
version with DoubleVectorProperty and its range (obtained through
another DoubleVectorProperty).

Unfortunately range information property didn't work at all.
I've found that there is an Update(SMProperty*) method missing in
vtkSMDoubleRangeDomain class, which updates a domain based on its
required property.

Creating Update method in the same way that it is done in
vtkSMIntVectorProperty solves this problem (for me at least).

I'm not sure if a method has just been removed or never been there
but I hope it helps.

Message-ID: <453601A95B713EA14AF54451@harpo.psc.edu>

Sorry for the duplicate post. I'd like to find a way to fix this that will 
stay fixed in future versions. Otherwise I'll have to hack CMake's output. 
As always, thanks in advance for any advice.

Kent

======================

I'm getting an error when compiling 2.2.1 that seems to be caused by the 
generated file ncconfig.h. Here's the relevant pieces of code:

... VTK/Utilities/vtknetcdf/attr.c
   #include "nc.h"

      #include "ncconfig.h"
         ...
         /* Define to `unsigned char'  if system doesn't define.  */
         #define uchar unsigned char

      #include <sys/types.h>
         ...
         typedef unsigned char uchar_t;
         ...
         typedef uchar_t uchar;
         ................1
         Error: In this declaration, "typedef" cannot be
         combined with "unsigned". (typeconflict)

It seems that cmake doesn't see the definition of uchar in the system file 
and so it adds its own definition during the generation of ncconfig.h.

This is on our Compaq Alphaserver running Tru64 with 750 nodes. This might 
also be relevant: "uname -a" returns "OSF1 iam764 V5.1 2650 alpha".

Suggestions? Thanks in advance!

Kent

All,
I'm having a problem with the "import package" capability.  I've attached the XML files for the client and the server manager.  When I try to "import package" I do not get any errors but I also do not get a source.
 
Thanks in advance,

That's because in your DiskSource.xml file, you nested the XML code 
for the disk source inside the XML pointing to the server manager XML 
file.  Change the second line in DiskSource.xml to the following 
(i.e, add the ending '/').

<ServerManagerFile name="DiskSource.pvsm" />

Also take out the following line two from the end in DiskSource.xml

<ServerManagerFile />

There is an example .xml files in the ParaView source tree at 
ParaView/Examples/PVLocal (PVLocal.xml.in and PVLocal.pvsm.in).

I just did:
	cvs update -PdAC
	make clean
	make

I'll tell you how it goes.

Hi Dave,

I have been trying to reproduce the error you are seeing when you try 
to read EnSight files in ParaView 2.2.1, but I have not been able to 
do so.  Is it possible for you to send me the files in this EnSight 
data set so I can try to track down this problem?

Ok,

Hi Teresa,

Is your G:/Fluent/ensight-vel-mag.vel file an 
EnSight case file?  They usually have the file 
extension .case.  If you have a file with the 
.case extension for this data set, try loading it instead of the .vel one.

Subject: [Paraview] DatasetTriangleFilter "creating" non-tet cells during
	volume visualization
Message-ID: <2E050D13A18B3C4CA35CAC71065E4EA20FA9BC@1upmc-msx15.acct.upmchs.net>

Dear ParaView list -

I am exporting Ensight Gold format files from a FLUENT CFD simulation for reading into ParaView.  The simulation consists of all tetrahedrons (and triangle surfaces) - I checked the output file manually to confirm this fact.  ParaView reports the presence of non-tet cells when attempting volume visualization, which I assume are created during the use of DatasetTriangleFilter prior to visualization.  Has anyone else seen this problem, and is there some sort of workaround?

Best regards -
Ken

Hi Ken,

I am calling in some expert help on this since I am not the author of 
vtkDataSetTriangleFilter.

Will: when given an input that consists solely of tetrahedra, what does 
vtkDataSetTriangleFilter do? Does it actually copy its output? Can it 
possibly produce non-tetra cells?

Lisa

The way the filter is right now it assumes that people will not use 
vtkDataSetTriangleFilter if they already have tetrahedra. There is an 
easy test for this: if you invoke vtkDataSet:GetCellTypes() it 
returns a list of all the types of cells found in a dataset. Using 
this test you can short circuit (i.e., skip using) the filter.

Having said this, I believe VTK should make life easier, not harder; 
and pipelines that change based on datatypes are hard to program in 
ParaView So IMHO the filter should be modified so that it simply 
passes data through in cases where the input is already simplices. 
This could be done pretty easily, and I'd be willing to do it before 
VTK 5.0 is cut.

Further, I am concerned that non-tetra cells are being created. While 
this is hard to believe, it is after all software and nothing 
surprises me anymore :-)  I'd like to see a simple dataset where this 
happens so we can find the problem and fix it.

Message-ID: <D9A8D98DDC682044806D5B46AF5C11E2078ABA@ARLABML01.DS.ARL.ARMY.MIL>

All,
I have downloaded the recent CVS version of Paraview and am trying to compile it with off-screen rendering support.  I finally got it to compile.  When I try to start paraview I get nothing??? 

I've attached the CMakeCache.txt file, if someone would provide some assistance it would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
John

All,
I have downloaded the latest CVS version of Paraview and built it to support off screen rendering.  I built mangled mesa, and finally got it to compile with no errors.  When I try to run paraview I get nothing???  It's as if the computer is trying to start the application but it never comes back..
 
Any ideas, thanks in advance

Let's keep this on the ParaView mailing list.

Are you saying that when you load the .encas file 
the entire data set loads properly or that there 
are no errors in the .encas file itself?  To open 
an EnSight data set, ParaView expects you to load 
a case file (an ASCII file that points to 
geometry and variable files), so if you try to 
load geometry (.geo) or variable (.vel and .scl1, 
in your data set) files directly instead of 
loading a case file, I would not expect ParaView 
to know what to do.  Also ParaView may have 
trouble with the .encas file extension (assuming 
this is your case file) since it expects EnSight 
case files to have the extension .case.

Hi,

 

I'm still having problems loading the Ensight files.  From the Fluent
manual this is what it says about exporting the Ensight data files:

 

EnSight Case Gold 

There are four files: 

 

A geometry file (e.g., file.geo) containing the coordinates and
connectivity information. 

 

A velocity file (e.g., file.vel) containing the velocity. 

 

A scalar file (e.g., file.scl1) for each selected variable or function. 

 

An EnSight case file (e.g., file.encas) that contains details about the
other exported files. 

You can specify the file Format as Binary or ASCII. The advantage of the
binary format is that it takes less time to load the exported files into
EnSight. You can specify the scalars you want in the Functions to Write
list. 

 

file/export/ensight-gold file-name list-of-scalars q yes|no 

 

 

These are the exact four files with the same extensions that I have. I
have now managed to load the .encas file but when I load the other files
nothing displays. When I click on Information they all say: Type -
unknown, 0 bytes, 0 points, 0 cells.

 

Any ideas?

 

Thanks,

 

Teresa

set) files directly instead of loading a case file, I would not expect
ParaView to know what to do.  Also ParaView may have trouble with the
.encas file extension (assuming this is your case file) since it expects
EnSight case files to have the extension .case.

Hi Teresa,

Is your G:/Fluent/ensight-vel-mag.vel file an EnSight case file?  They
usually have the file extension .case.  If you have a file with the
.case extension for this data set, try loading it instead of the .vel
one.

Hello Teresa,

 

First of all, try to set up the byte order to "little endian"

Hi,

 

I am totally new to ParaView and have been given some files in Ensight
Case Gold Format to read. However, everytime I load up the files and
then press Accept the program exits/crashes.  The trace script reads as
follows.

 

Any ideas - I will do the tutorials though in case this is some novice
error on my part,

You should not be directly loading any EnSight 
files other than case files. A case file does not 
contain any geometry or variables, but it points 
to the files that do. When you load a case file 
in ParaView, the corresponding geometry and 
variable files are loaded as a result. For your 
data set, you should be able to load file.encas 
into ParaView. Doing this will cause your 
geometry (file.geo) and variable (file.vel and 
file.scl1) files to be read as well. ParaView 
does not know how to load EnSight geometry or 
variable files apart from the case file, so if 
you try to load them separately, nothing should be displayed.

You should not be directly loading any EnSight files other than case
files. A case file does not contain any geometry or variables, but it
points to the files that do. When you load a case file in ParaView, the
corresponding geometry and variable files are loaded as a result. For
your data set, you should be able to load file.encas into ParaView.
Doing this will cause your geometry (file.geo) and variable (file.vel
and file.scl1) files to be read as well. ParaView does not know how to
load EnSight geometry or variable files apart from the case file, so if
you try to load them separately, nothing should be displayed.

Hi,
 
I'm still having problems loading the Ensight files.  From the Fluent
manual this is what it says about exporting the Ensight data files:
 
EnSight Case Gold 
There are four files: 
 
A geometry file (e.g., file.geo) containing the coordinates and
connectivity information. 
 
A velocity file (e.g., file.vel) containing the velocity. 
 
A scalar file (e.g., file.scl1) for each selected variable or function. 
 
An EnSight case file (e.g., file.encas) that contains details about the
other exported files. 
You can specify the file Format as Binary or ASCII. The advantage of the
binary format is that it takes less time to load the exported files into
EnSight. You can specify the scalars you want in the Functions to Write
list. 
 
file/export/ensight-gold file-name list-of-scalars q yes|no 
 
 
These are the exact four files with the same extensions that I have. I
have now managed to load the .encas file but when I load the other files
nothing displays. When I click on Information they all say: Type -
unknown, 0 bytes, 0 points, 0 cells.
 
Any ideas?
 
Thanks,
 
Teresa

Let's keep this on the ParaView mailing list.

Are you saying that when you load the .encas file the entire data set
loads properly or that there are no errors in the .encas file itself?
To open an EnSight data set, ParaView expects you to load a case file
(an ASCII file that points to geometry and variable files), so if you
try to load geometry (.geo) or variable (.vel and .scl1, in your data
set) files directly instead of loading a case file, I would not expect
ParaView to know what to do.  Also ParaView may have trouble with the
.encas file extension (assuming this is your case file) since it expects
EnSight case files to have the extension .case.

Hi Amy,
 
I have an .encas file which has loaded fine but it's the .vel .geo .scl1
files which cause it to crash. I have looked the  Ensight website which
talks about exporting the files from Fluent 
http://www.ensight.com/FAQ/faq.0019.html
and it seems like the files are exported with these extensions,

Hi Teresa,

Is your G:/Fluent/ensight-vel-mag.vel file an EnSight case file?  They
usually have the file extension .case.  If you have a file with the
.case extension for this data set, try loading it instead of the .vel
one.

Dear all

I have a reader building a hierarchical dataset made of Unstructured Grids.

If I use the following code:

  reader->Update();

  vtkHierarchicalDataExtractDataSets *Part =
vtkHierarchicalDataExtractDataSets::New();
  Part->SetInputConnection(0, reader->GetOutputPort(0));
  Part->AddDataSet(0,0);

  vtkContourFilter *watersheets = vtkContourFilter::New();
  watersheets->SetInputConnection(0, Part->GetOutputPort(0));
  watersheets->SetInputArrayToProcess(0,0,0,
vtkDataObject::FIELD_ASSOCIATION_POINTS,"Volume Fraction");
  watersheets->SetValue(0, .5);

ContourFilter complains that there is no data to process (line 250 of
vtkContourFilter)

if instead, I set the input to contour directly from the DataSet (0,0 in
my example), my isosurface is correctly built.

Here is what I do to make it work:

  watersheets->SetInput(reader->GetOutput()->GetDataSet(0,0));

==
This is telling me my reader correctly loads the PointData and I am
thinking that maybe vtkHierarchicalDataExtractDataSets only does a
shallow copy of Unstructured Grids without passing the PointData? I have
other examples (AMR) which work fine. The only difference here is that I
have Unstructured grids.

Any idea to help me debug this?

Thanks in advance.

vtkHierarchicalDataExtractDataSets produces vtkHierarchicalDataSet as 
output; it's the data sets inside the vtkHierarchicalDataSet that 
have point data. The vtkContourFilter does not know how to directly 
operate on vtkHierarchicalDataSets. Either you need to use a 
vtkHierarchicalPolyDataMapper when you are displaying your data, or 
you need to tell the filter to use the vtkCompositeDataPipeline 
(using the vtkAlgorithm::SetExecutive method). The second option is 
what is done in ParaView.

Hi. I just transferred from using ParaView 1.8.5 to 2.2.1. I'm trying to 
setup a CaveRenderModule which seems to be a very different process in 
2.2.1. I have been seeing several references to a "pvx" file in order to 
setup my Cave configuration, but I can't seem to find any documentation on 
what this file is and/or how it works. Could someone point me towards 
something regarding this? Thanks.

Hi Joel,

I have attached a sample .pvx file. (It is the same one that was 
attached to the email announcing ParaView 2.2.1. If you are using a 
separate render server, the XML for specifying cave parameters would 
look something like the following. (If you aren't using a render 
server, change the first line to <Process Type="server">.) For each 
display in your cave, you'll need a separate "<Machine ... />" entry 
in the XML file. When you run ParaView, pass this XML file (*.pvx) as 
a command-line option to each executable you are running (pvclient, 
pvserver, etc.)

   <Process Type="render-server">
     <Machine Name="rs_m1"
              Environment="DISPLAY=rs_m1:0"
              LowerLeft="-1.0 -1.0 -1.0"
              LowerRight="1.0 -1.0 -1.0"
              UpperLeft="-1.0  1.0 -1.0" />

         ...

   </Process>

Message-ID: <2E050D13A18B3C4CA35CAC71065E4EA20FA9BF@1upmc-msx15.acct.upmchs.net>

Will, Lisa -

Thanks for looking into this; I didn't find this in an application that I myself built but in ParaView stable and development; Does ParaView perform the cell type check you mentioned prior to calling vtkDataSetTriangleFilter before volume visualization?  

The grid I have is quite fine in some areas due to the need to resolve flow accurately; could there be some merging of near-coincident nodes during the import-triangularization process that could cause "non-tet" cells to be created? Unfortunately, I don't have a simple dataset that could be an example.  The dataset I have is about 1.4 - 1.5 million tets but I could ftp it if you would like to test it on your installation. I can also try to put a small program together to see what dumps out of vtkDataSetTriangleFilter and let you know what I find. 

Thanks and best regards -
Ken

Subject: Re: [Paraview] DatasetTriangleFilter "creating" non-tet cells  during volume visualization
 
The way the filter is right now it assumes that people will not use 
vtkDataSetTriangleFilter if they already have tetrahedra. There is an 
easy test for this: if you invoke vtkDataSet:GetCellTypes() it 
returns a list of all the types of cells found in a dataset. Using 
this test you can short circuit (i.e., skip using) the filter.

Having said this, I believe VTK should make life easier, not harder; 
and pipelines that change based on datatypes are hard to program in 
ParaView So IMHO the filter should be modified so that it simply 
passes data through in cases where the input is already simplices. 
This could be done pretty easily, and I'd be willing to do it before 
VTK 5.0 is cut.

Further, I am concerned that non-tetra cells are being created. While 
this is hard to believe, it is after all software and nothing 
surprises me anymore :-)  I'd like to see a simple dataset where this 
happens so we can find the problem and fix it.

Message-ID: <4305CE61.8010404@t-online.de>

Hi,

I made a large cube consisting of  8 small cubes. (Voxels).
filled with 8 3d-Vectors .

Having in mind that cutting reduces the dimensionality, I made a cut and 
then
produced some arrows (glyphs) for my vector-field.
But the arrows are still pointing  to 3d-directions?

I expected that the arrows lie only inside the cutting plane?

perhaps I forgot to use some other filter???

thanks for any help!

regards Franz

This is expected. Cutting will not reduce the dimensionality of the
vectors just the geometry. I believe there is a filter called Surface
Vectors that will do this for you.

Yes, if you are running ParaView in single-process mode; it does not 
work in parallel. Use the --stereo command-line argument: ./paraview --stereo.

Dear Amy / list,

Sorry for bouncing into the discussion, but we are currently trying to get
the stereo to run in parallel mode, but with no luck (as you mail suggests
;-).

Is it not possible at all to set up machines-files /.xml files to get four
rendering servers to show a widescreen stereoscopic image (two projectors
for left eye, two projectors for right eye) ?

And if not - is there any where in the code you could point us to a simple
hack - after all it is fairly easy to introduce stereo, just be setting up
the right async viewing frustrums...

Please help - you are our only hope...

Cheers,

Michael

Hi Again,

It just occured to me that there is a CAVE rendering module - isn't that
running stereo in parallel ??? - And how do you set up the .xml file for
that (you see we can configure our cluster setup to just to quad-buf stereo
and send right-left eye out different graphics ports...).

Cheers,

Michael

I have a reader building a hierarchical dataset made of Unstructured Grids.
3 actors are built to process a subsets of datasets (cutter, threshold
and contour).

The first two (cutter and threshold) execute and display fine, while the
3rd one (contour) causes a segmentation fault.

Since they are all three consuming the same data, I cannot understand if
vtkContour expects things a little bit differently.

I am further puzzled by the fact that ParaView (2.3) runs without any
crash, cutting, thresholding and iso-contouring the data. So what does
ParaView do under the hood to make Contour run without crashing, and
what is the magic line of code I need to add to the almost-equivalent
C++ test program below?

I have included a stack trace for the curious folks.


////// C++ code
vtkCFX5Reader* reader = vtkCFX5Reader::New();
  reader->SetFileName(fullname);
  reader->UpdateInformation();

vtkHierarchicalDataExtractDataSets *eds =
vtkHierarchicalDataExtractDataSets::New();
  eds->SetInputConnection(0,reader->GetOutputPort(0));

  for(i = 10; i <= 16; i++)
    {
    eds->AddDataSet(0,i);
    }

vtkContourFilter *contour = vtkContourFilter::New();
  contour->SetInputConnection(0, eds->GetOutputPort(0));
  contour->SetValue(0, .5);

vtkHierarchicalDataSetGeometryFilter *geom9 =
vtkHierarchicalDataSetGeometryFilter::New();
  geom9->SetInputConnection(0, contour->GetOutputPort(0));

  contouract->SetMapper(contourmap);

  cuts->SetCutFunction(plane);

  vtkPolyDataMapper* cutsmap = vtkPolyDataMapper::New();

The problem is that the parallel rendering (compositing) code in 
ParaView does not handle stereo. I don't think it would be an easy 
thing to just hack in.

Hello all,

Does anybody know if it's possible to run Paraview with tiled display in
serial mode?

Unless for some reason you want a single tile, it is not because you 
need a process per tile.

I've speeded up my amr reader by turning inside out the loop that reads the scalar variables from the dataset and loads them into the vtkHierarchicalDataSet.  

Below is the current piece of RequestData() that does that work.  I measured the time spent in the five code blocks indicated, and by far the most time is spent in BLOCK FIVE, ds->GenerateVisibilityArrays().

Does that sound right?


Thanks.

   vtkDataObject* doOutput = info->Get(vtkCompositeDataSet::COMPOSITE_DATA_SET());
   vtkHierarchicalBoxDataSet* ds = vtkHierarchicalBoxDataSet::SafeDownCast(doOutput);

   int runsize = this->fvo_hb - this->fvo_lb + 1;
   int* levelPerBlockId = new int[runsize];

   { // BLOCK ONE ----------------------------------------
   for(int i=0; i<this->numLevels; i++) {
      for(int j=0; j<this->numBlocksPerLevel[i]; j++) {
         if ((this->fvo_lb <= this->blockIdsPerLevel[i][j]) && (this->blockIdsPerLevel[i][j] <= this->fvo_hb)) {
            levelPerBlockId[this->blockIdsPerLevel[i][j] - this->fvo_lb] = i;
         }
      }
   }
   } //  -------------------------------------------------

   vtkDoubleArray*** scalars;   //   vtkDataArray*[k][runsize]

   //   TRY ALLOCATING THE MIDDLE DIMENSION HERE, RATHER THAN IN flashVtkComponents
   scalars = new vtkDoubleArray**[count];

   { // BLOCK TWO ----------------------------------------
   for (int k=0; k<count; k++) {   //   FOR ALL SELECTED SCALAR VARIABLES
      scalars[k] = new vtkDoubleArray*[runsize];
      //   GET ARRAYS FOR ALL BLOCKS IN THIS PROCESS' RANGE
      this->AddBlockrunScalars(this->fvo_lb, this->fvo_hb, indices_of_selected[k], scalars[k]);
   }
   } //  -------------------------------------------------

   { // BLOCK THREE ----------------------------------------
   for (int i=this->fvo_lb; i<=this->fvo_hb; i++) {
      vtkUniformGrid* ug = vtkUniformGrid::New();
      this->fvo->DefineUG(levelPerBlockId[i - this->fvo_lb], i, ug);   //   LEVEL IDX, BLK ID & GRID

      for (int k=0; k<count; k++) {   //   FOR ALL SELECTED SCALAR VARIABLES
         scalars[k][i - this->fvo_lb]->SetName(this->varNames[indices_of_selected[k]]);
         if (this->fvo->GetDataLocation() == LocPoint) {
            ug->GetPointData()->AddArray((vtkDataArray*)(scalars[k][i - this->fvo_lb]));

         }

      ds->SetDataSet(levelPerBlockId[i - this->fvo_lb], i - this->fvo_lb, ug);
      ug->Delete();
   }

   for (int k=0; k<count; k++) {   //   FOR ALL SELECTED SCALAR VARIABLES
      delete [] scalars[k];
   }
   delete [] scalars;
#endif

   { // BLOCK FOUR ----------------------------------------
   for(int i=0; i<this->numLevels; i++) {

So I set VTK_USE_SYSTEM_ZLIB = ON
and Paraview won't build because the hdf5 reader is looking for vtk_zlib.h
In ParaView/CMakeLists.txt it does
SET(HDF5_ZLIB_HEADER "vtk_zlib.h")

Amy,

What about the Cave renderer ? dosn't it support stereo - or is cave
viewing done in mono ?!
- it would then be possible to setup a "flat" cave then...

Cheers,

Michael

Oops - missed the FAQ. I followed the steps, so now the options look  
like:

BUILD_SHARED_LIBS                ON
CMAKE_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY    2.0
CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE
CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX             /usr/local

VTK_WRAP_HINTS                   /Applications/ParaView/ 
paraview-2.2.1/VTK/Wrapping/hints

and I still get the same error:

Is there some other steps that need to be taken, or options which

The FAQ is accurate for Panther and gcc 3.3, but apparently not for  
Tiger with either 3.3 or 4.0. I wish I could tell you what worked :(

OK - found out what the deal was:
http://www.absoft.com/Support/FAQ/macosx92faq.html#anchor1005

I had upgraded from Panther, but had not updated XCode and clan to  
the latest. Things seem to be rolling along fine now.

OK - from my last message, update to XCode tools 2.0, and the compile went fine. However, I then
got a pile of relocation errors such as:

/usr/bin/ld:
/Applications/ParaView/paraview-2.2.1_build/bin/libvtkKWParaView.a(vtkPVBooleanKeyFrame.o)
relocation overflow for relocation entry 871 in section (__TEXT,__textcoal_nt) (displacement too large)

I did a bit of looking and found some lists elsewhere that seemed to suggest adding -mlongcalls to
the gcc and g++ flags, but I ended up getting an invalid option error:

Building object file ProcessUNIX.o...
/Applications/ParaView/paraview-2.2.1/VTK/Utilities/kwsys/ProcessUNIX.c:1: error: invalid option
`longcalls'

so either I had the flag wrong, or this is not it. Any ideas - perhaps I goofed elsewhere?

Thanks,

Dave

I have measured that too on a single dataset example. It is a 250 Mb
dataset, 2D, 5 levels, 171 grids, 5 scalars and 1 vector field. It is
stored in a single HFD5 file.

I stuff all levels with node-based data.

Reading 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, then 6 variables gives me a data stuffing time
linearly increasing from 0.35 seconds to 1.2 seconds for all 6 variables

Generating visibility arrays is of constant time (independent of the
number of variables read) and is 4.2 seconds.

so I can only confirm what you see. Don't know that we can speed that up
though.

I can report the same problem, as I am using the same environment (OS X 
10.4.2, Xcode 2.0). At least, now we know the problem is reproducible. I 
haven't found a fix, though.

There should be room for improvement in GenerateVisibilityArrays(). I
am swamped for the next few weeks but I will try to look into it as
soon as possible (together with an array of other AMR related things).
Right now, I am working on fixing/improving vtkCompositeDataPipeline,
specially to get EnSight reader work as a multi-block source. What I
am doing should benefit AMR readers/filters as well.

29 of Servers/ServerManager/vtkSMSourceProxy.h. Amy, can you apply
this patch to ParaView 2.2 branch?

Oops. I meant change line 29 of vtkSMDisplayProxy.h not vtkSMSourceProxy.h.

Subject: [Paraview] "Gluing a puzzle..."
Message-ID: <20050824153255.57CA072855@mailhost.nacad.ufrj.br>


Hi all,

I have a problem about pos-processing parallel files when running Paraview
in serial mode. 

My parallel partitions are all placed in Ensight case files (Fortran/Binary)
numbered according to each partitions, thus, I have: 

file.case00 pointing to file.geo00, file.vec00, and file.scl00
file.case01 pointing to file.geo01, file.vec01, and file.scl01
...
file.casenn pointing to file.geonn, file.vecnn, and file.sclnn

(The sub-domains are all locally numbered from 1 to the number of entities
inside each partition)

My problem is about the surface (interface) formed between each MPI
partition. When I load these case files in parallel with an Ensight
server-of-server file (sos file), the Paraview filter (I think that is the
"clean to grid" filter...) removes these annoying surfaces for me, but,
sometimes I'm forced to pos-process parallel results in serial mode and this
filter does not produce the same effect, so, the question is: Is there any
way to clean the interfaces between partitions when running Paraview in
serial mode?

Thanks for any help.

Two questions:

 

For demos how can I toggle the display into full screen mode?

Once I've activated the stereo capabilities on the command line can I
toggle the stereo on or off?

Normally this information should be included in a report but I happened 
to realize the problem anyway...

The problem is that when VTK_USE_RPATH is OFF then kwProcessXML is 
actually a small forwarding executable that internally calls 
kwProcessXML-real.  Since the executable is needed during the build 
process then building kwProcessXML should also build kwProcessXML-real. 
  I've added the dependency:

/cvsroot/ParaView/ParaView/Common/KWCommon/CMakeLists.txt,v  <-- 
CMakeLists.txt
new revision: 1.67; previous revision: 1.66

If you update from CVS the problem should be fixed.

Hi,

 

I've been given the following four files to view some data in VTK

 

test.xyz (the mesh file)

test.f     (the variable file)

test.fvbnd (a file holding information about which faces are walls)

test.nam (a file giving the names of the variables in the .f file)

 

the test.xyz and test.f are both singleprecission unformatted files in
the 

plot3d format

the test.fvbnd and test.nam are both ascii files.

 

So far I've had no luck loading them in ParaView. Has anyone else done
this? Any ideas?

 

Thanks,

Teresa

Dear all,
I am trying to build paraview-2.2.1 on a Itanium 2 ia-64 running Linux
2.4 with gcc 2.96.
I have installed cmake version 2.0.3 for Linux-ia64. It gives the
following message when running make:

[tfoggia@ticino paraview-2.2.1Build]$ make

gmake: *** No targets specified and no makefile found.  Stop.
make[2]: *** [maketcltk] Error 1
make[1]: *** [Utilities/TclTk/CMakeFiles/maketcltk.dir/all] Error 2
make: *** [all] Error 2


The same message appears again after a complete cvs update and rebuilt
of cmake.
Seems like cmake doesn't create the makefile for Utilities/TclTk/.

Hello,

I'm interested in using ParaView's Server Manager in Python.
I've noticed that wrapping code has been added recently to
CVS repository and I wonder if anyone could provide the simplest
example of using it.

I cannot figure out what should I do to initialize an application
that uses Server Manager. Is creating vtkSMApplication and
invoking Initialize() method enough? Does it start data/render servers?

Thanks in advance,
Wiktor Moskwa

Hi Wiktor,

Currently ParaView server manager can be used only through the python
interpreter build in ParaView called pvpython. This is a regular full
featured python interpreter that initializes MPI and ServerManager.

Ok, as far as example goes, should be something like this:

import libvtkPVServerManagerPython
pvsm = libvtkPVServerManagerPython

foo = pvsm.vtkSMObject()
proxyManager = foo.GetProxyManager()
smApplication = foo.GetApplication()

pvTemp542 = proxyManager.NewProxy("sources", "P3DReader")
proxyManager.RegisterProxy("sources", "pvTemp542", pvTemp542)
pvTemp542.GetProperty("FileName").SetElement(0, "/some/file/name.xyz")
pvTemp542.GetProperty("QFileName").SetElement(0, "/some/file/name.q")
pvTemp542.UpdateVTKObjects()

and so on.

I am using a program that only writes visualisation data as either 
Fieldview or Tecplot data files. I am only interested in unstructured 
grid files, mostly just surface definitions. (Aerodynamic shapes with 
scalar properties, pressure, temperature etc.)

The Fieldview file is quite similar to legacy vtk and so I am writing a 
little conversion utility, however, I thought I'd ask if anyone has 
already done something like this and could save me the trouble, or 
conversely, if anyone else might be interested in my code once I've 
completed it.

Thank you for your answer and example, it explains most things.

I've managed to make things work under Python but only without
interaction. Do you know how to enable interactor in a render module
proxy? (at this point method InteractiveRender() doesn't work for me)

My second question is how to tell vtkSMRenderModuleProxy to use my
vtkRenderWindow?

I'm trying to find answers by reading ParaView sources but the client
layer looks quite complicated.

Best regards,

You will need to create interaction layer on top of it. By default
ParaView ServerManager does not have code to support mouse events. You
have to do something like:

  vtkPVGenericRenderWindowInteractor* iren =
    vtkPVGenericRenderWindowInteractor::SafeDownCast(rm->GetInteractor());

and then invoke events on iren.

You will have to expose the method on render module to allow setting of
window id. Look at vtkRenderWindow,
Server/ServerManager/Resources/rendering.xml and vtkSMRenderModuleProxy.

Hi,

The bug described below on 8/8/2005 remains a problem. I've hacked the 
makefiles to force a workaround but would like to hear from the CMake folks 
on how to put in a fix that works on future versions too. Thanks!

======================

I'm getting an error when compiling 2.2.1 that seems to be caused by the
generated file ncconfig.h. Here's the relevant pieces of code:

... VTK/Utilities/vtknetcdf/attr.c
   #include "nc.h"

      #include "ncconfig.h"
         ...
         /* Define to `unsigned char'  if system doesn't define.  */
         #define uchar unsigned char

      #include <sys/types.h>
         ...
         typedef unsigned char uchar_t;
         ...
         typedef uchar_t uchar;
         ................1
         Error: In this declaration, "typedef" cannot be
         combined with "unsigned". (typeconflict)

It seems that cmake doesn't see the definition of uchar in the system file
and so it adds its own definition during the generation of ncconfig.h.

This is on our Compaq Alphaserver running Tru64 with 750 nodes. This might
also be relevant: "uname -a" returns "OSF1 iam764 V5.1 2650 alpha".

This seems to be the same issue as bug #2103 in the bug tracker 
(http://www.paraview.org/Bug/bug.php?op=show&bugid=2103).  This bug 
has been fixed in the main CVS tree for ParaView and on the 2.2 
branch, so it will be corrected in the 2.2.2 release.

Thanks for a hint, it made me find a similar interaction layer in
ParaView source code. As far as I understand:
  * PVRenderView is a control that encapsulates SMRenderModuleProxy and
    its RenderWindow,
  * PVWindow has PVRenderView object and passes all events to
    PVGenericRWI (obtained from the same SMRenderModuleProxy as above),
  * PVGenericRWI uses tricky feedback machanism to update PVRenderView
    object (PVRenderViewProxy and its Implementation).

My guess is that I should create another implementation of
PVRenderViewProxy that forwards Render calls to my control.
This new control could take care of forwarding events and displaying
RenderWindow. Am I correct?

Subject: [Paraview] filters
Message-ID: <6.2.1.2.2.20050831090921.02c320e0@pop.mcs.anl.gov>



I have a set of disconnected points that I know to be roughly on an isosurface, and want to construct the surface from them.

The only VTK-ish way I know of is to apply vtkGaussianSplatter to the points to create a scalar field, and then to apply a contour filter to that to get a surface.

And, that's not available in paraview.

Or, is there some filter -- OR SEQUENCE THEREOF -- in paraview that I've overlooked that would do the trick?

Subject: [Paraview] Paraview running remotely through  VNC
Message-ID: <20050901005231.08970727D0@mailhost.nacad.ufrj.br>


Hello all,

I have been getting the following error message when I try to run Paraview
2.2.1 remotely in a SGI Prism server (Linux kernel 2.4.21-sgi306r6, Quad
Itanium-2 1.5 Ghz, dual ATI Fire GL X2) through VNC in a Windows client
machine.

Xlib: extension "GLX" missing on display ":2.0".

This problem does not happen when the access is done through a X terminal
and a X11 SSH tunneling in the client machine, but this kind of connection
is too slow.

Does anybody have any idea about this problem?

Thanks for any help
