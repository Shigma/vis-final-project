Subject: [Paraview] ParaView and MultiGroup data
Message-ID: <b4cbb0870607011630r458315aamc41b7db7cb90892f@mail.gmail.com>

I'm using ParaView to visualize an AMR hierarchical data , it follow the
standard of the VTM file format  which group a set of vts files each one
contain a single data set and the VTM file contain about 8 groups . There no
cube repeated between different groups (The cube is on one group only) .

When the file loads it is assigned automatically to a
XMLHierarchicaldataReader and is classified to a Multi-group file .

The problem is that when , I'm trying the Contouring Filter to extract a
3D-isosurface from this data sets, i doesn't work correctly .

I was asking before here about how to make an iso-surface for an AMR data ,
and the response was that I should use the regular iso-surface.

The problem in the iso-surface is that it contain cracks and small holes, in
the case of a join between two group boundaries.

The file is contain of cubes which differ in the size according to their LOD
,so when the cube is on a boundary of any group and it has neighbours from
the next group ,  a hole appear .

This shouldn't be the situation in the AMR data ,
I want to know if i did some thing wrong , or there is a special option to
enable AMR iso-surface

Thanks In Advance,

I'd just like to mention that we have also noticed that there is a 
problem with filters using multiple scalars. The SetInputArrayToProcess 
call only ever sets index zero on the filter, so if you try to use 
another vector/scalar within a filter it doesn't work.

I should have submitted a bug report some time ago, but never got around 
to it. I suspect the place to look is inside the server code where 
SetInputArrayToProcess is being called (easier said than done of course) 
to find out if it is correctly getting the array index.

NB. I've only tested this rather briefly, so it's possible that some 
other thing is going wrong, but you can verify it doesn't work by 
creating a dataset with random vectors, instantiating a ribbon filter, 
then changing the vector selection on the ribbon filter and seeing that 
the ribbons never change.

I've just typed this in one go from memory, so please forgive if I've 
made errors.

Hi Karla,

Can you be more specific? Maybe post some screenshots and data? That filter
has been quite thoroughly tested on single processor. I also fixed a few
bugs that were in the parallel implementation. Depending on your ParaView
version, you might not have the fixes for the parallel version. I would be
surprised if the integration algorithm itself has a bug. Of course, there
are always numerical accuracy issues and you can compensate by using a
different integrator or adjusting the step-size (the default is Runge-Kutta
2, I believe). Known issues are:

* Premature ending of streamlines in C-grids where the grid folds onto
itself (this may be what you are seeing)
* Premature ending of streamlines in singlular cells

I also need to check a bug report that reads "Streamlines wrong for uniform
rectilinear data... You would expect a streamline to form a circle around
the X axis, but what you get is a streamline that seems to go in completely
the wrong direction. The problem only seems to happen in rectilinear
data.  If you convert to an unstructured grid (with Clean to Grid), the
streamline appears as expected.".  I am guessing it is a bug in the voxel
cell type. I will check this bug and fix it if necessary in next few weeks.

Subject: [Paraview] PV in client-server mode seems slower than standalone

Hi Peter,

What are your 3D view settings? Also, what is the size of your dataset and
the geometry you have generated? Fine-tuning client/server performance is a
form of art, I am finding out :-) Usually, there are two different extremes
when running in client/server mode:

1. Large geometry, cannot be rendered by a single node
2. Small to medium size geometry, can be rendered by a single node much
faster than server

In the first case, there is no choice. The geometry has to be rendered on
the server. Therefore each render has to follow these steps:

1. Client tells server to start rendering (*)
2. Client sends camera information (*)
3. Client starts waiting for progress
4. Server starts rendering
5. Server sends progress (repeat until rendering is done) (*)
6. Server sends final image to client (*)
7. Client renders image

* Communication over TCP/IP

In this situation, the potential bottlenecks are
1. All the communication over TCP/IP
2. Rendering performance of the server

If the server is not equipped with a decent graphics card, it may render
much more slowly than client. Sometimes, there is no alternative because the
geometry is too large to render on the client.

Solutions:

To reduce client/server communication, reduce the size of the image that is
sent to client either through compression or size reduction. In 3D view
settings, adjust:
* Subsample rate (size reduction)
* Squirt compression

Note that these settings only impact the interactive rendering. The final
render after you release the mouse will not be impacted.

In the second case, you have to tell ParaView that you want client to do the
rendering instead of the server.  This is done by adjusting the composite
threshold on the 3D view settings page. The threshold is the size of all
geometry in MBytes. If the size of geometry is above the thresold, the
geometry is rendered on the server and delivered to the client. If below,
the geometry itself is delivered to the client and is rendered locally. It
is also possible to disable compositing alltogether. If ParaView detects
that the server cannot render (no DISPLAY set for example), it will disable
compositing automatically (as of 2.4.3, I believe).

Potential bottlenecks:
1. Geometry is too large and client cannot render geometry fast
2. Geometry has to be delivered to client everytime filter(s) re-execute,
this usually happens only after Accepting
3. An existing bug causes ParaView to tell the server to start sending
progress during each render. This is a no-op but still cause TCP/IP
communication. This is only relevant if the client/server connection is slow

There is also a hybrid mode. ParaView can use a reduced geometry model
during interaction. This is controlled by the LOD threshold and LOD
resolution on the 3D view settings. It is possible to adjust the 3D view
settings such that the LOD is small enough to be rendered locally and the
full geometry is rendered on the server. Using this, you can get the best of
both worlds (in theory).

We have plans to make ParaView smarter and make some choices for the user
based on the frame rates.

On top of all of the above, there are bottlenecks arising from the fact that
everytime a parameter changes, it has to be sent from client to server over
TCP/IP. If a response is requested, event handling is disabled until it
arrives. This causes some choppiness of the GUI.

Without knowing exactly what you mean by leses responsive, this is all I can
say (which is a lot, I guess) :-)

Subject: [Paraview] viewing properties that are discontinuous across cell
	boundaries
Message-ID: <200607030918.38648.pjb9508@vashon.ca.boeing.com>


We have developers interested in viewing properties that are discontinuous 
across cell faces/edges.  It could be higher-order derivatives, or the 
basis-functions themselves are discontinuous.  

Can PV do this, and if not, how difficult would it be to implement?  I'm 
assuming it would require some type of tesselation, or, a programmable 
vertex/fragment shader.   

Thanks in advance

ParaView can do this now in certain situations. Such variables are termed 
"cell data" as opposed to "node data" (also called "point data"). Many 
methods require node data; however, converting from cell data to node data 
uses averaging and therefore eliminates the discontinuity.

I use two methods to display cell data directly. "Cut" will color each cell 
with the selected cell variable. "Cell Centers" can turn cell data into 
points without interpolation, and "Glyph" can then display each point 
(scalar or vector) with a sphere or arrow.

Subject: [Paraview] Debugging PV: Where is the source code? Setting breaks
	in GDB?
Message-ID: <200607031203.56337.pjb9508@vashon.ca.boeing.com>

I'm trying to debug PV, and one of the problems I'm having is that I don't 
know where the actual source is.  The error message here points me to a file:

/acct/pjb9508/VTK/paraview-2.4.3/VTK/IO/vtkEnSight6BinaryReader.cxx

but this does not seem to be the actual source code.  Strangely, when I alter 
this file it triggers make to recompile, but the changes are not taking 
effect.  For example, I cannot alter the text at line 222:

"Invalid number of unstructured points"

Also, I cannot seem to set breakpoints in GDB using this file path.  

Can anyone explain to me what is going on?  Thanks.

Message-ID: <55048.128.165.242.125.1151953983.squirrel@webmail.lanl.gov>

Hi all,

I am trying to use ParaView on a linux cluster using MVAPICH.  I have
built the latest ParaView sources with MPI enabled (as far as I know). I
can launch all of the created binaries with mpirun_rsh and have them work
fine as long as I only use "-np 1".  Even the simple "mpirun -np 2
thismachine thismachine /path/to/paraview" stalls.  When I say stalls, I
mean a process is created, nothing is output to stdout nor do any X
windows pop up.  CPU utilization remains at 0. Other programs using
mvapich on these machines work fine.

The (I think) relavent guts of my cmake config are below:

BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF
MPI_EXTRA_LIBRARY=/usr/local/lib/libibverbs
MPI_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/local2/mvapich/include
MPI_LIBRARY=/usr/local2/mvapich/lib/libmpich.a
VTK_MAX_NUMPROCS=2 # I didn't set this myself, configure probably got this
(correctly)
VTK_USE_MPI=ON
VTK_MPIRUN_EXE=/usr/local2/mvapich/bin/mpirun

Separate but related question, probaby a simple one at that -- I'm new to
MPI.  Does anyone know of a nice way to somehow "watch" whats going on
with MPI to see which hosts are talking to which other hosts when.. in
which communicators?

That's weird. That's where the source code is. Is it possible that you are
getting shared library from somewhere other than the build tree? Try an ldd
on the executable? Are you installing with make install and running? If you
didn't install after building the second time, you may see the behaviour you
are running into. I would expect breakpoints to still work though. My main
platform is Linux and I debug with gdb daily. I never run into any problems.
Also, if you have a non-classified data that demonstrates the problem, we
can take a look at it. I am guessing it is something simple.

Did you try attaching to the paraview process with a debugger to see where
it is stuck? With MPI, specially exotic vendor specific implementation, it
is common to run into problems and not see any error output.
To get more information on what paraview is doing, you can use profiling. I
don't know if you MPI implementation supports it. There are a few flavor of
it. At the simplest level, you link your application to a set of  special
MPI libraries. When you run the application, it produces a log. You can
later use some other tool to look at the result. At the most sophisticated
level, you instrument your code by adding specialized profiling calls.
ParaView doesn't do that.

Message-ID: <200607031245.34304.pjb9508@vashon.ca.boeing.com>

The EnSight reader is exiting after an assertion fails based on the file size.  
Notice I have stuck in an additional error message printing out data. 

It is saying the file size is negative.   Has anyone seen this error before?  
The type of FileSize is an integer.  What if the size is larger than the 
range of int? 

The file size is being set at line 92:


    struct stat fs;
  if ( !stat( filename, &fs) )
    {
    // Find out how big the file is.
    this->FileSize = (int)(fs.st_size);

Subject: [Paraview] Bad Code Generated for Remote Module (Maybe)
Message-ID: <735B3116FDD45EF7BFE0699B@nvlap.psc.edu>

It *seems* that bad server code has been generated for a remote module 
named "vtkCloud" that I am building. Note the emphasis on "seem" - it could 
be that the gdb debugger has become confused. A few details:

   Pentium III
   CentOS release 4.3 (Final)
   Linux  2.6.9-34.0.1.EL
   gcc (GCC) 3.4.5 20051201 (Red Hat 3.4.5-2)
   paraview 2.4.3

The initial problem was that in vtkCloud::RequestData

   vtkDataArray *D = this->GetInputArrayToProcess( 0, inputVector )

always returns 0 for D. However, as I poked around with gdb, it seems that 
this might be caused by a deeper problem.

I put a breakpoint in

    .../Servers/Filters/vtkCloudClientServer.cxx
   ==>vtkCloudCommand

I single-stepped down to where it jumped into

   .../Utilities/VTKClientServer/Filtering
   /vtkPolyDataAlgorithmClientServer.cxx
   ==>vtkPolyDataAlgorithmCommand

then onward to

   .../Utilities/VTKClientServer/Filtering
   /vtkAlgorithmClientServer.cxx
   ==> vtkAlgorithmCommand

then down (in the same file) to

   op->SetInputArrayToProcess(temp0,
   temp1,temp2,temp3,temp4)

This is the version where the 5th argument is a string. Then I entered "s" 
and see

   0x0a543bf8 in vtkAlgorithm::SetInputArrayToProcess ()
   at .../Utilities/VTKClientServer/Common
   /vtkPlaneCollectionClientServer.cxx:11
   11  vtkObjectBase *vtkPlaneCollectionClientServerNewCommand()

WHAT? How did I get to vtkPlaneCollection? This is repeatable.

To try a different approach I started over and in vtkCloud::RequestData at

   vtkDataArray *D = this->GetInputArrayToProcess( 0, inputVector )

stepped one instruction to see

   0x0a543cc0 in vtkAlgorithm::GetInputArrayToProcess ()
    at .../Utilities/VTKClientServer/Common
   /vtkPlaneCollectionClientServer.cxx:11
   11  vtkObjectBase *vtkPlaneCollectionClientServerNewCommand()

Obviously most ParaView routines can set/get the input array just fine. The 
difference is that I have set PARAVIEW_EXTRA_EXTERNAL_MODULES to add two 
modules (vtkCloud and another one). Is it possible that cmake or something 
else has gotten confused?

Thanks in advance!

Message-ID: <e4fafd990607041211x7ec39a28le7f5dbd29cf11408@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I was able to get a deformation field output from my 3D deformable
registration, but it's not what I was expecting to see:  There seem to be 64
sets of arrows, which is good because it corresponds to the 64 slices of MRI
data I used.  But each of the sets of arrows, supposedly from each of the
slices, seem to originate from a single point on a line.  I was expecting to
see the field in a manner similar to that of the 2D deformable registration
examples, where arrows are located on the images in plane, showing what
features have moved and where they have moved to.  Is it possible to get
that in the 3D case?  Are there other ways of visualizing 3D deformation
fields in ParaView?

Note that my fixed, moving, and output images for the registration are in
the ANALYZE format (.hdr and .img files) and my deformation field is in the
Meta image file format (.mhd and .raw files).


Thank You,
Kevin

I'm using Paraview 2.4.3 in client-server mode on a little linux cluster 
with graphic cards.
I'm using mpich 1.2.7 and compiled with the settings of the following 
variables :
VTK_USE_MPI  on
MPI LIBRARY 
MPI INCLUDE PATH
MPI EXTRA LIBRARY
MPI EXECUTABLE mpirun
CMAKE C COMPILER mpicc
CMAKE CXX COMPILER mpicxx

Then I copied the files of Paraview and MPI on other nodes of the cluster. 


When I launch the application in client-server mode, a warning message 
appears, telling me that I won't be able to use compositing.
"To enable compositing, compile and run the server with offscreen Mesa 
support or assign a valid display to all server nodes."

For obvious reason, I would like to choose the second solution.

How can I assign a valid display to all server nodes so that the server 
can render ?
The DISPLAY environment value is :0.0 on all nodes for the user.
The ~/.rhosts file lists all nodes. mode 700. The UID of the user is the 
same on all nodes.
MPIRUN has been added to the PATH variable, MPI libs to LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
The machine list file contains the machines of the server.

Thanks again for your help,

Thank you so much for replying. I've uploaded pictures, movies and data to: (see description below)

www.tacc.utexas.edu/~vega/Blood_Flow

The movies and pictures are under "Vis". I also have uploaded 25 timesteps to "Data".
We've seeding streamlines were the velocity field was the highest. We used point-cloud and we noticed that some of the streamlines end at the walls and some just stop at some points as you can see from the pictures. We worked for a while on seeding the streamlines correctly and using different integrators and step sizes, but nothing seemed to work (although it did look better when we seeded streamlines at the highest velocity points).
The computer we are using is a Linux (Red hat) Dell Precision 670 Mini-Tower 3.60GHz, XEON Processor w/ 2MBL2 Cache with 8 GB in memory. The paraview version we are using is 2.4.2 64 bit.

I also wanted to ask you about the blending that Paraview uses. As you can see from the pictures, objects in the back are not being blended correctly. Is there a way to fix this?
Maybe changing the rendering to be back-to-front instead of front-to-back?


Thank you again for all your help!

A periodic flow waveform is applied at the inlet of the aorta, while resistance boundary conditions are applied at all outlets. The computational mesh consists of 52,420 quadratic NURBS elements, and the output of the simulation includes pressure and velocity fields. The entire time series of data is approximately 500MB."

Hi Karla,

Can you be more specific? Maybe post some screenshots and data? That filter
has been quite thoroughly tested on single processor. I also fixed a few
bugs that were in the parallel implementation. Depending on your ParaView
version, you might not have the fixes for the parallel version. I would be
surprised if the integration algorithm itself has a bug. Of course, there
are always numerical accuracy issues and you can compensate by using a
different integrator or adjusting the step-size (the default is Runge-Kutta
2, I believe). Known issues are:

* Premature ending of streamlines in C-grids where the grid folds onto
itself (this may be what you are seeing)
* Premature ending of streamlines in singlular cells

I also need to check a bug report that reads "Streamlines wrong for uniform
rectilinear data... You would expect a streamline to form a circle around
the X axis, but what you get is a streamline that seems to go in completely
the wrong direction. The problem only seems to happen in rectilinear
data.  If you convert to an unstructured grid (with Clean to Grid), the
streamline appears as expected.".  I am guessing it is a bug in the voxel
cell type. I will check this bug and fix it if necessary in next few weeks.

Message-ID: <5AD2AC0CC249CA12341F176B@nvlap.psc.edu>

Lets say I compiled from source then wished to recompile with debugging. 
This is what I tried:

   -- run ccmake
   -- set CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE to DEBUG
   -- configure
   -- generate and exit
   -- run make

A great many warnings result (all, it seems, from hdf code).

The above steps work fine when compiling in an empty directory. Is there 
some other step to make this work? Or must one always wipe out the 
non-debug version first?

I've seen this too... many times. What I've learned so far is that at
least in Fedora Core 5 there is no libosmesa.so there is a comment on
this in mesa.spec.

# FIXME: libOSMesa does not build when DRI is enabled for some reason.  It
# seems next to impossible using the totally broken Mesa buildsystem to build
# both DRI drivers and OSMesa in a single build.  If someone feels like fixing
# all this to build on all 7 architectures, be my guest.

If I build mesa without dri and link paraview against that GL inatead of
the system GL saving images and movies works in paraview.

Berk, you've pointed out the lines to comment out to me before and that
worked. Should paraview check if the GL supports offscreen rendering
before it tries to use it?

ParaView checks for offscreen support before using it. The problem seems to
be with a bug in the pbuffer implementation of certain drivers. The few
reports I had were from nVidia drivers. Note that we do not use osmesa
unless the option is specifically enabled. I have commited a patch to the
CVS head that may fix the problem.

Hmm, I saw this save image problem with the xorg ati drivers for Fedora
Core 5 on x86_64 when I used the system GL and I did not check the cmake
option for support of offscreen mesa in the GL. I could have messed
something else up though.

I'll try the patch and let you know.

we just fix this problem by "assign a valid display to all server nodes".
Because mpirun will first execute .bashrc on each node, by adding following lines to .bashrc file in home directory, you are able to set "DISPLAY"variable of each server node to be the local IP:0.0 respectively. and then HW acceleration in client/server mode is ok!

host=`uname -n`
ip=`grep $host /etc/hosts | awk '{ print $1; }'`
export DISPLAY=$ip:0.0

You should check to be sure that you do indeed have DISPLAY set to :0.0
on each node and that you have authority for the X-Servers.  It sounds
like your MPI configuration uses rsh to execute its processes, so to
test this for some node, do the following:
rsh somenode xlogo

If DISPLAY really is :0.0, then the xlogo should appear on the display
for that node (I'm assuming you have some way of verifying that node's
video output).  

If you get a "Can't open display: " (with no display value after the
color) error, then DISPLAY is not actually getting set.  You'll have to
be sure it is set in the appropriate .login/profile/cshrc/bashrc/etc for
your shell, or you can pass environment variables on the mpirun command
line.

If you get a "connection to :0.0 refused by server" error, then you
don't have authority for the X-Server.  The quick fix is running "xhost
+" or "xhost +localhost" from the console of each node.  Or you can use
xauth to gather the X-Authority data from each node (much more involved,
but also more secure).

Subject: [Paraview] HOW TO ENABLE AN ADDED FILTER ON PARAVIEW
Message-ID: <1152199750.44ad2c46ead10@webmail.lncc.br>

Hi All.

I've added a custom filter into paraview module. The problem is that I can't
enable it.
At my client's XMl I have a:

<Input name="Input"
  class="vtkImageData"/>
</Filter>

Server's:

<DataTypeDomain name="input_type">
  <DataType value="vtkImageData"/>
</DataTypeDomain>

Even with a vtkImageData source loaded, my filter stills won't enable.

A curious thing is that I've copied the smooth from the paraview's XML into
mine, and created a Smooth2. As a result, I had a Smooth2 disabled at the Menu!

Does anyone knows how to solve this problem (enabling a filter at the "Filters"
menu?)

Please post the whole XML entry for your custom filter for both the 
client and server XML, not just the part about what dataset type your 
filter accepts. There are other factors (e.g., the number and type of 
attribute data arrays in the dataset) that would affect whether your 
filter is enabled.

Message-ID: <200607061002.31561.pjb9508@vashon.ca.boeing.com>

When I try and run PV in client-server mode I get a window that pops up that 
has a title "Visualization Toolkit - OpenGL".  At times it appears that the 
graphics is being rendered in this window, but it is very confusing as this 
window and the normal graphics window go blank very easily and take quite a 
while to redraw.  

Is this normal? 

Thanks

Hi Peter,

Yup that's very normal. The OpenGL titled window that you are seeing is
the server side render window. When running in client server mode and
compositing is enabled, all renders on geometry greater than the user
specified threshold are sent to the (render) server. If compositing is
disabled (or compositing threshold is greater than geometry size), the
client renders locally. In either case, the final rendered result is
shown on the client.

If you don't want the server to render at all thus avoiding the poping
up of the OpenGL titled window, from the "View" menu
select "3D View Properties" and unselect the check box next to
"Composite". Note that the "Composite" slider/checkbox is visible only
when running in client-server mode.

Alternatively, you can use OffScreenRendering on the server side to
avoid the creation of the render window.

Utkarsh.

This 123450/123451 tags are used while compositing. Something went wrong
on the server while rendering. Can you verify that the server is running
when this error is raised? Also, can you see the "OpenGL" titled window
which the server side render window, when these errors are flashed?

Closing the "OpenGL" titled window will raise the errors. One should not
close this window. To disable the server side window, turn off
compositing and restart the application, that way the server side window
won't show up at all.

Message-ID: <200607061218.04414.pjb9508@vashon.ca.boeing.com>

hi, I've loaded an EnSight dataset and I've noticed that there are two filters 
called "tesselate" and "tesselator" that are grayed out.  A while back I read 
a posting that said that some of the filters for EnSight data was disabled 
but would be fixed soon.  Will these become available?  These filters would 
be very useful for us.  Thanks as always.

Subject: [Paraview] Selecting Cell Data
Message-ID: <B54DE6BF54CD302D79F7FF13@harpo.psc.edu>

How does one set the XML for a module that must use cell data? My module works as expected in these ways:

   - it will only connect to sources providing cell data
   - only variables attached to cells are shown in the array menu

But inside the new module's RequestData routine the call

   vtkDataArray *D = this->GetInputArrayToProcess( 0, inputVector )

returns a null. The superclass for the new module is vtkPolyDataAlgorithn and so when I dug in with the debugger I eventually, as expected, got to

   vtkAlgorithm::GetInputArrayToProcess( int idx, vtkDataObject* input)

where on line 305 the test

    if (fieldAssoc == vtkDataObject::FIELD_ASSOCIATION_POINTS)

evaluates to true. It therefore tries to find point data with the given name and fails. In other words, I need to change my XML so that fieldAssoc indicates that we want cell data.

Here's a part of the GUI xml:

======
      <Filter class="vtkCloud">
         <Input name="Input" class="vtkDataSet">
            <ArrayRequirement attribute="Cell" components="1"/>
         </Input>
      </Filter>
      <InputMenu id="inpMen" trace_name="Input" input_name="Input"
         property="Input"  label="Input"  help="Input to this filter" />
      <ArrayMenu id="arrMen"  input_menu="inpMen"  trace_name="Scalars"
         property="VariableForDensity"  label="Density Scalar"
         help="Input cell scalar used for point density" />
======

And here is a part of the server manager XMl:

======
         <InputProperty name="Input" command="SetInput">
            <ProxyGroupDomain name="groups">
               <Group name="sources"/>
               <Group name="filters"/>
            </ProxyGroupDomain>
            <DataTypeDomain name="input_type">
               <DataType value="vtkDataSet"/>
            </DataTypeDomain>
            <InputArrayDomain name="input_array1" attribute_type="cell"
               number_of_components="1" />
          </InputProperty>
         <StringVectorProperty name="VariableForDensity" 
            command="SetInputArrayToProcess" number_of_elements="5"

Message-ID: <44AD7517.6050306@uchicago.edu>

It sounds like ParaView on the Intel Mac platform is a solved problem, 
but has anybody managed to get ParaView 2.4 to build and run 
successfully on Mac OS X 10.4 on a PowerPC? If so, how?

I've tried Kitware's binary of PV 2.4.4 on my G4 PowerBook running OS 
10.4.7, and so far, it seems to run perfectly. Kitware: how do you build 
these binaries? Which Mac OS version are they built on? Which compiler? 
May I see the CMakeLists.txt that you use?

I have Carbon/Cocoa OFF and X11 ON. I've tried various settings for 
OPENGL_INCLUDE_PATH, OPENGL_*_LIBRARY, BUILD_SHARED_LIBS, and 
VTK_USE_RPATH. I was able to build a binary, but it segfaults after 
showing a splash screen and -- weirdly -- putting an icon in my dock. 
X11 apps don't produce dock icons. I think I remember somebody 
mentioning a Tcl/Tk issue related to that, but I can't find it on the 
mailing list. Anyway, I would appreciate any advice.

Thanks,

Chad,

I was not even able to compile it on Mac OS X Power PC. I tried it  
three weeks ago, and have not revisited the problem again but intend  
it to soon.

Um.. actually it is the other way around. Paraview is a non-starter  
on Intel Macs. It compiles and then segfaults. Kitware has pretty  
much abandoned the Paraview 2.x series on OS X.
    I had a version of Paraview (2.2) I think that ran on OS X PPC,  
10.4, but was actually compiled under OS X 10.3.9. I think you might  
need to compile with GCC 3.3 instead of GCC 4.0.. maybe.. There are  
some threads regarding this in the archives of this list.

Also, from June 13, 2006 posting to this list from Berk Geveci:

So basically, if you have an Intel Mac, either run Bootcamp with  
Windows or run Parallels with Linux or XP. But pretty much forget  
Paraview on OS X, at least until next year. If  you are running OS X  
on a PPC machine, the best you can probably do is run the precompiled  
binaries.
    This whole state of paraview on OS X is pretty sad considering  
the engineers at Kitware are an extremely bright bunch of people. I  
have had the wonderful opportunity to work in person with a few of  
them and they were always able to answer questions and create new  
pipelines for us.
    Basically it comes down to _percieved_ market share of OS X and  
priorities for Kitware.

Mike,

I have built paraview 2.4.3 on my Intel Mac (just so the record's 
complete), and it does not seg fault.  (Or, it might've the first time I 
ran it, but it has worked fine since.)

But, if I'm the only one in the galaxy who's been able to do that, your 
claim that it's a non-starter is still true.

Either send me your CMakeCache file or send me the binaries... If  
they work I will offer a public apology.. until then I stand by what  
I have found.

    Also, what hardware are you running? I am running OS X 10.4.6/7  
on a MacBook PRO.

Hi Mike,

Try this CMakeCache.txt, it's the result of some advice I received  
when I was try to build ParaView. The post must of been off of the  
mailing list. Hopefully I remembered to thank Ivan. (His message is  
at the bottom of this one.)

Hi Rick,
I used to have similar problems as I tried to compile ParaView form  
my MacBook. The solution was to  set both CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS and  
CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS to
-Wl,-serch_paths_first .
By default paraview was linked against the wrong ones. Here's a quote  
from my own thread in this mailing list as I had the compiling problems:

Hi Chad,

I follow the instructions on the ParaView FAQ when I build the ParaView 
binaries for Mac OSX: 
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView:FAQ#How_do_I_compile_ParaView_for_Mac_OS_X.3F. 
If a particular CMake variable is not explicitly mentioned in the 
instructions, it means that I do not change CMake's default settings.

The version of Mac OSX we build the binaries on is 10.3.9.

The compiler is gcc 3.3.

I have attached a copy of the CMakeCache.txt file so you can see how the 
other variables are set.

I hope you find this helpful.

Alain,
I'm going to reply to the mailing list too.  This problem appears on the
list from time to time, so it might benefit others.

I see one thing that might be deceiving you.  When you echo environment
variables through rsh, you need to put single quotes around the echo
statement or the env var, or else your shell on your local host will do
the substitution instead of the remote host.  For example,
rsh node# 'echo $DISPLAY'

So, I'd try running #3 and #5 again.

But based on the response from #2 ("Can't open display: "), with nothing
after the colon, I'd say that DISPLAY isn't set.

Apparently, rsh (though not ssh) doesn't source your .bashrc by
default.  You might try creating a .bash_profile that sources your
.bashrc.  If that doesn't work, try the same thing with .profile.  

Finally, there may be a way to configure rshd to source your init files
properly, but I'm not sure about it.  I use ssh, so I haven't had this
sort of problem.

I've updated my CVS checkout and built a fresh Paraview linked against
the system GL (mesa-libGL-6.4.2-6.FC5.3) and image saves now work with
the system GL. I even checked that they work when the paraview window is
partially covered by another window.

Thanks a lot!

I saw that in one build I had and then I couldn't reproduce it. It is weird.
I will look into it when I come back from vacation in a week. I'll ask Clint
to check it out while I am gone.

Subject: [Paraview] New snapshot of ParaView 2.9 (to be ParaView 3.0)
Message-ID: <44AE99DC.2010808@kitware.com>

Hi Folks,

I posted the june snapshot of ParaView 2.9 (to be 3.0) on the web. The files are at:
http://paraview.org/files/v2.9/
There are binaries for linux (x86) and windows. Make sure you download 2.9.1. 
2.9.0 is the snapshot from May. I also uploaded an exodus file 
(disk_out_ref.exo). It is good file to play with to see some of the new features.

We wanted to open the CVS repository this week but I am leaving on vacation for 
a week (yeay!) and I ran out of time. It will have to wait until I come back.

Some new features to look for (in no particular order):

* Support for more file formats (exodus reader is still the one that is tested 
and customized best)
* Statistics view
* Two undo/redo stacks: 1. pipeline operations (ctrl+z, ctrl+r) 2. view 
operation (ctrl+b, ctrl+f)
* Visibility control on the pipeline inspector
* Selection (still at alpha, use toolbar buttons or 's' key to switch between 
interaction & selection)
* Support for more sources
* Support for contour and streamlines filters
* Support for saving & loading state
* Saving screenshot
* Saving animation. Very alpha. It only support creating animations from readers 
that support time (File->Save Animation)
* Bug fixes

We are working on:

* Readers/filters
* Custom filters (being able to create custom filters by selection part of a 
pipeline, saving, loading and instantiating them)
* Full featured animation
* Colormap editor
* Application/3D view settings
* Python interface
* Selection
* Server connection interface

Longer term:

* Support for multiple views
* Client side plotting using Qt widgets (2D plots, histogram)
* Multiple server connection
* Multiple client connection

Some of these features are already in alpha stage and are enabled in the CVS 
development tree. I disabled them to make binaries. Use the snapshots and CVS at 
your own risk. I would not recommend using 2.9 for production use. Bug reports 
are obviously welcome :-)

I'll be thinking of you in Maine (or maybe not).

ParaView has two client-server configurations.
1) client -- server
2) client -- render server -- data server.

Seems like you are starting a pvclient in a "client-render-server" mode,
 you are starting the render server and then instead of starting a data
server (pvdataserver) you are starting a server(which is data+render
server--pvserver) and hence pvserver is complaining.

Try using the executables: pvclient, pvrenderserver, pvdataserver.

Utkarsh.

try this:

pvclient -rc -crs --render-server-host=sitka

The dataserver connects to the render server, and the location for the
render server is obtained from the client. When render-server-host is
not specified, it defaults to localhost, hence the data server
connection is complaining.

Try this:
Save the following as a pvx file say :/tmp/config.pvx

<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<pvx>
  <Option Name="reverse-connection" />
  <Option Name="client-render-server" />
  <Option Name="client-host" Value="sitka" />

  <Process Type="client" />
  <Process Type="data-server" />
  <Process Type="render-server" >
    <Machine Name="sitka" />
  </Process>
</pvx>

Now you can start the 3 process as:
> pvclient /tmp/config.pvx
> pvrenderserver /tmp/config.pvx
> pvdataserver /tmp/config.pvx

It's tough to make linux binaries :-) They worked on the systems I tried.
I'll be gone next week but I asked Utkarsh to release a binary built on
another machine.

Thank you for sharing the linker trick! I was able to build ParaView  
2.4.4 with GCC 3.3 and with GCC 4.0 on Mac OS X 10.4.7 on a G4, and  
both binaries are working perfectly so far. I think I remember trying  
those linker settings a few months ago and only getting a segfault,  
but I must have been making some other mistake.

Chad,

Apple usually breaks OS X for open source builds during its major upgrades.
By about 10.x.6, open source builds start to work again. This is because
both Apple and the open source developers work on the libraries, make files,
etc. 

Watch out when OS X 10.5.0 appears. This has held true for 10.2 => 10.3 and
10.3 => 10.4 in my experience. I think Apple is listening, but they never
say so.

Ok, I checked it out and found a few things....
The patch to "fix" the Xlib error, which led to the flickering was 
incorrect.  I backed it out.  There's nothing wrong with our Pbuffer 
impelementation in VTK.

So we're back to the Xlib error.

I made the following program (see attached) and did the following....

1)
g++ main.cxx -lGL
./a.out
# no errors

2)
g++ main.cxx -Wl,-rpath=/usr/lib64 -lGL
./a.out
# I get
X Error of failed request:  BadLength (poly request too large or 
internal Xlib length error)
  Major opcode of failed request:  145 (GLX)
  Minor opcode of failed request:  28 ()
  Serial number of failed request:  33
  Current serial number in output stream:  34

The embedded rpath is all it took.

For 1), ldd a.out gives /usr/lib64/nvidia/libGL.so.1   because my 
ld.so.conf prefers that (which the nvidia installer did).
For 2), ldd a.out gives /usr/lib64/libGL.so.1  which is not the nvidia 
GL library.

So, I found two ways to have VTK/ParaView build using the nvidia client 
gl library.
a)  If I remove all /usr/lib64/lib*.so from my CMakeCache.txt file and 
replace them with -l*  (replace /usr/lib64/libGL.so  with -lGL) then 
CMake won't embed /usr/lib64 in the binaries, and it works fine.
b) I can set my opengl library to the full path, 
/usr/lib64/nvidia/libGL.so (instead of /usr/lib64/libGL.so which is 
found by default) and it works fine.

So, is it our fault for not building the binaries correctly, or is it 
nvidia's fault for their glx server not being compatible with another 
client gl library?  Or both?

Clint

OK.. I apologize to Kitware for my outbursts but there is a subtle  
error when you follow the directions on the wiki: (http:// 
www.paraview.org/Wiki/ 
ParaView:FAQ#How_do_I_compile_ParaView_for_Mac_OS_X.3F)

 From the wiki it says:

"Also make sure that OPENGL_INCLUDE_DIR is set to a directory that  
contains GL/gl.h, and set OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY and OPENGL_glu_LIBRARY  
accordingly."

Well, when you run ccmake on the paraview source the opengl libs and  
includes are _still_ pointing to a directory that has gl.h and glu.h  
except that directory is the OpenGL Frameworks. To build this  
properly you really should be pointing the OpenGL entries in the  
ccmake to /usr/X11R6/lib/libGL.dylib and /usr/X11R6/lib/libGLU.dylib.  
The includes seem to be picked up correctly in /usr/X11R6/include.

   The other bit about "CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS and  
CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS to "-Wl,-search_paths_first" is new to me.  
No has ever suggested that to me until the email below from Rick  
Wagner (Rick I owe you something.. ). So all the ranting and raving I  
did and no one from Kitware said, hey this really does work and all  
you have to do is .....   All I got was the standard "we don't  
support OS X".

Now what would be _nice_ is if the standard CMakeLists.txt that comes  
with Paraview had a nice "IF DARWIN SET EXE_LINKER_FLAGS... " and  
"Set OPENGL_LIBS " _already_ set so that Paraview would just compile  
straight out of the box. It would go a long way to having new folks  
who give Paraview a try on OS X have a much easier time.

Sorry for my immature attitude lately.. but it is a bit frustrating  
when your Primary Vis app stops working and you get no joy from the  
Developer.

Now.. on to remove that BootCamp Partition and figure out what  
my .vti files will not load.

Subject: [Paraview] Possible Endian Issues on Paraview OS X Intel
Message-ID: <508B7019-FB81-47D5-B358-04B9A25AE200@gmail.com>

So I finally got Paraview 2.4.4 compiled and running on my MacBook  
Pro (thanks Everyone). I attempted to load up a file written with  
vtkXMLImageDataWriter and I get an Error that essentially locks up  
Paraview.

Here are the errors:

ErrorMessage

The same file loads and runs fine on a Powerbook G4 running the same  
OS X 10.4.7, but Paraview 2.4.3.

I scanned the source files but did not see anything that stuck out as  
testing for endianness. These same files also work on a Windows XP  
box if that helps.

Is the compile process for paraview making assumptions about byte  
ordering based on Operating System instead of actual hardware?

I _was_ able to load a legacy VTK Data file on the intel OS X machine  
just fine.

Should I rebuild in Debug instead of Release to get more details in  
the error message?
Would a Newer version of Paraview work? Is there a known bug?

I was using vtk 5.0.0 to write the xml base VTI file.

I took the same data file that would NOT load in Paraview and wrote  
this small program to load and display it. The program works fine  
compiled against vtk 5.0.0

I then compiled/Linked against the build of VTK that Paraview uses  
and low a behold the same error occurs. So if I am using Paraview  
2.4.4, what version of VTK am I using? Can I substitute in VTK 5.0.0  
for the VTK that is in Paraview 2.4.4?

Thanks for any help.

I took the liberty of adding a note to the Wiki about the LINKER  
flags, but I didn't touch the part about the other settings, because  
I wasn't sure if the settings that worked for me on 10.4 and on PPC  
would apply to Intel or other Mac OS versions. Also, I'm not really  
sure what the etiquette is with a Wiki, so I didn't want to change  
too much.

Maybe we should document the changes from the CMake defaults that are  
necessary for compiling ParaView on each Mac platform. I'd be willing  
to add to the Wiki a list of changes necessary on a G4 with 10.4.7,  
but I notice that some of the settings that worked for me are  
different from the settings that worked for Randy Hudson's Intel  
MacBook Pro.

I just did a ccmake in a fresh build directory and diff'ed the  
CMakeCache.txt files. Here are the changes I made:

BUILD_SHARED_LIBS:BOOL=ON
CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS:STRING=-Wl,-search_paths_first
CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS:STRING=-Wl,-search_paths_first
OPENGL_INCLUDE_DIR:PATH=/usr/X11R6/include
VTK_USE_CARBON:BOOL=OFF
VTK_USE_RPATH:BOOL=OFF

VTK_USE_RPATH option does not appear in ccmake until running  
'configure' after changing BUILD_SHARED_LIBS to ON.

The following settings were OK by default:

OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=/System/Library/Frameworks/OpenGL.framework
OPENGL_glu_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=/System/Library/Frameworks/AGL.framework
X11_X11_INCLUDE_PATH:PATH=/usr/include
X11_X11_LIB:FILEPATH=/usr/X11R6/lib/libX11.dylib
X11_Xext_LIB:FILEPATH=/usr/X11R6/lib/libXext.dylib
VTK_USE_COCOA:BOOL=OFF

    Well, to cut to the chase.. It isn't such a good idea to use a  
CmakeCache file from a PPC OS X machine on an Intel OS X machine. And  
to prove such a theory I started a clean build on the Intel machine  
by using ccmake to make the changes, then moved the CMakeCache file  
to the Powerbook G4 and reran ccmake. I the only thing I did change  
on the Powerbook (PPC) machine was to set the Build Arch to PPC from  
i386. I ran the build, waited...... and then finally ran Paraview.  
Interestingly the problem that I had on the Intel MacBook Pro is now  
showing up on the Powerbook.
    So I started again with a fresh Paraview 2.4.4 and created build  
directories on each machine. I ran ccmake on each machine separately  
and made sure the settings were the same on each machine (Except for  
Build Arch, which needs to be set correctly on each machine). I  
changed the Linker flags to those mentioned in the wiki. Changed the  
OpenGL include to use /usr/X11R6/include but left the OpenGL libs to  
use the default frameworks in /System/Library/Frameworks. Ran the  
build on each machine and now each machine can load the "troublesome"  
data file.

So what we can learn from this is that there are still some compile  
decisions that are being made on each platform that make the transfer  
of a CMakeCache file between OS X machines of different architectures  
impossible.

I have no idea what the problem is. I am just happy to have my  
paraview back and working again.

Hi Chad,

Actually, having a list of various settings that do work (specifying 
which compiler and which version of OSX you use) to build ParaView would 
be a very helpful addition to the wiki. As long as you are adding useful 
content, please feel free to modify the wiki.

Problems with the system ( Fedora Core 5, xorg, ati, mesa, x86_64 ... )
libraries are left unexplained, correct?

Both methods of compiling your test program complain that they,
"couldn't find FBConfig".

Just to check some more, I linked your program against the libGL.so I
built directly from the Mesa source without DRI and it works fine.

g++ main.cxx -Wl,-rpath=/home/kevin/Mesa-6.4.2/lib64/ -lGL

This is strange to me because both should be the same version of mesa,
though they are built with different options, and the rpm version has a
patch or two.

CMakeCache.txt should never be moved from one machine to another, even 
with the *same* architecture. Within CMakeCache.txt are several full 
path references to files that exist on the machine where the CMakeCache 
was created/updated.

It's "invalid operating procedure" ever to move a CMake build tree from 
one machine to another. The only possible way that could ever work is if 
every reference to a header file or library or tool or path name in the 
CMakeCache is identical on both machines. (Something that's highly 
unlikely, given the number of settings in ParaView's CMakeCache...)

Hope this helps to clarify things a bit and avoid problems like these in 
the future,
David Cole

Message-ID: <e4fafd990607101116v3d6145f4uac0d1ea9a3281de9@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I was able to get a deformation field output from my 3D deformable
registration, but it's not what I was expecting to see:  There seem to be 64
sets of arrows, which is good because it corresponds to the 64 slices of MRI
data I used.  But each of the sets of arrows, supposedly from each of the
slices, seem to originate from a single point on a line.  I was expecting to
see the field in a manner similar to that of the 2D deformable registration
examples, where arrows are located on the images in plane, showing what
features have moved and where they have moved to.  Is it possible to get
that in the 3D case?  Are there other ways of visualizing 3D deformation
fields in ParaView?

Note that my fixed, moving, and output images for the registration are in
the ANALYZE format (.hdr and .img files) and my deformation field is in the
Meta image file format (.mhd and .raw files).


Thank You,
Kevin

Message-ID: <BF944328-8F08-4EAE-A568-7130CA2EC741@coas.oregonstate.edu>

Hi,

I have just started to use ParaView on Windows. First a word of  
complement for efforts.

I do have a question, as a beginner. My questions is: How does one  
display a 2D slice from a 3D data?

There is a plane widget (p. 64 on the manual). I can create a 2D  
plane in a 3D cube as a thick red line. How do I display it. For my  
research, I need to plot planes as time evolution for analysis and  
debugging? As a new user, could someone please point.

Cheers,

Kush

Keng,

I am enclosing my paraview file (ASCII, .vtk). Is your element  
connectivity OK to begin with?

Subject: [Paraview] Tcl: accessing VTK properties via proxies/server manager
Message-ID: <44B369E4.3020901@christoph-moder.de>

Hi all,

I have partly understood how to use the Tcl command line; after figuring 
out the class hierarchy, I was able to do stuff like:

[[[$Application GetMainWindow] GetCurrentPVSource] GetPVColorMap] 
SetScalarRange 0 0.5

But this works only for vtkPV... or vtkSM... objects. How do I access 
VTK properties like vtkCamera::SetEyeAngle()? As far as I have 
understood, there must be a proxy for this object which is controlled by 
the server manager. But how is it done? Can anyone give me some hints?

Thanks,
Christoph

Thanks Sean,

The DISPLAY variable was not read in ~/.bashrc because this file began 
with a line
telling to do nothing if the shell was not run interactively.

As mpich uses rsh, a not interactive shell, the rest of the file was not 
read, and the DISPLAY variable not set.

Just comment the line and everything works fine.

Xiaoli,

Try changing line 192 to:

  return
(vtkOpenGLExtensionManagerFunctionPointer)glXGetProcAddress((const
GLubyte *)fname);

If that does not work, try compiling with gcc rather than the native
Solaris compiler.  Whatever happens, please let us know so we can
resolve this issue for other users.

You are correct, paraview uses proxies for every VTK object. However
this proxy is not an instance of the vtk object for which it is a proxy.
A proxy is vtkSMProxy (or subclass). A vtkSMProxy provides properties
(vtkSMProperty subclasses) which can be used to call methods on the vtk
object the proxy stands for.

To get started with using the proxy-property interface try this:
* create a visualization in paraview.
* select File | Save Batch Script and save the visualization as a batch
file.
The batch file shows how to create new proxies as well as modify
properties on those proxies.

I've set all of the threshold controls for LOD very low but cannot get it to 
kick in.  For example,  the representation of the surface geometry attached 
will not change when rotating and therefore is very slow.  Can anyone tell me 
what I'm doing wrong?   Thanks

What is the LOD resoultion?
Try setting LOD resolution to 10x10x10 (slider to the right).
Any improvement?

If still no change, just for a sanity check try this:
* create a simple source, say sphere.
* set Theta Resolution to 100
* set Phi Resolution to 100
* set [Display Tab] | Representation to "Wireframe"
Now try interacting. Are you seeing a simplified sphere while interacting?

Hi Kevin,

Could you please post in a web site a screenshot of the
visualization of your deformation field ?

It is hard, from your verbal description, to understand what
is going on with the registration/visualization.


You may want to take a look at the ITK Software Guide:

      http://www.itk.org/ItkSoftwareGuide.pdf

in Section 8.15.2 "Visualizing 3D Deformation Fields",
PDF-page 502 (Book page 470) there is a description on how
to use ParaView in order to visualize the 3D displacement
field resulting from a deformable registration method.

Note that you must pay particular attention to the pixel
size of your images and the scaling that you use for the
Glyphs inside ParaView.

If computed correctly, the vector of your displacement
field should be measured in the *same* units as the
pixel spacing is defined in your input images.



     Regards,



         Luis

Message-ID: <b45d6a1e0607110949p6b709a8brb1470aca62d65c17@mail.gmail.com>

I would start by trying to do something like:

[ [ [$Application GetRenderModuleProxy] GetRenderer ] GetActiveCamera ]

I can't currently test this as I am not running in stero view, so the camera
i get back doesn't support stero settings.

If you starting getting confused on what class you really are accessing use

GetClassName

The other option to changing stero views would be doing

[ [ [$Application GetRenderModuleProxy] GetRenderWindow ] SetStereoType int


Check out http://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkRenderWindow.html for
more info on the stero options in RenderWindow

Hi Kevin,

Thanks for posting the screenshots of the deformation field
visualizations.

Your verbal description was accurate.  Therefore, there is
definitely something wrong going on with the deformable
registration process.

Could you please post the .mhd files of your deformation
fields ?

like "set50_s_10_field.mhd"

Those are the text headers of the MetaImage format, they
should give us an idea of the number of pixels in the 3D
deformation field as well as the pixel size in 3D.


   Thanks


      Luis

explains what we are seeing in ParaView.


The voxel size is about 1000 times larger
in the Z direction     :-/


ParaView is showing the reality of the data.



What you may want to verify now, is whether that
was the original pixel size of the images that
you were registering. In particular you should
look at the Fixed image.

Note that if that's the real spacing on the fixed
image... well... there is not hope for registering
such dataset, because it is a more of a rod than
it is a volume...   :-/


Please let us know what you find.


    Thanks



       Luis

Set sphere representation to wireframe. 
Set LOD resolution to 10x10x10.
Set LOD threshold to 0.  

When I rotate the sphere I still don't see LOD.

Thx

Hi Peter,

Sure. Create a cut plane through your volume, then create streamlines on 
the plane.

That is if your surface is a plane. If not, then you can use isosurface 
and so on.

Hi Kevin,

Thanks for letting us know that you found the source
of the error in the voxels spacing of your datasets.

Regarding the validation, unfortunately there are no
standards on how to validate deformable registration.

The common approach is to artificially generate a
deformation field by using ThinPlateSplines, use this
artificial deformation field in order to create a
deformed version of your image. Then use your registration
method between the original and the deformed image, and
finally compare the artificial deformation field against
the one that you produced with the registration method.

Another option is to compare the resampled deformed image
against the original image (via a squared image difference).

 From the pragmatic point of view, I would not expect
to be able to recover a deformation field because in
most cases the problem is not invertible. In any case,
for a medical application it is worth to design some
verification test.



    Regards,


       Luis

Dear ParaViewer !

I compile paraview with mpi on our SGI Prism. There are 8 Graphik pipes
with ATI FIREGL , and on the other side i have a Desktop PC with a
Nvidia 6600 , 
The Application on the PC Does performs good. But on the SGI Prism i
get very slow or no Result renderingh the same File.
Maybe ( I hope not)  ATI  FireGL is not working. So i hope i'm doing
something wrong. I already orderd the paraview users guide, but it takes
15 Days for shipping.

ANY Help would be mostly usefull

Hi Cristian,

Is it possible you are exporting display to your desktop PC instead of 
doing rendering on the prism? You should be running client/server 
(pvclient and pvserver) and when doing that, make sure your display for 
the server is set to prism's display.

So, make sure you are running pvclient on desktop PC and not on the prism.

Subject: [Paraview] Can a module display a string in its GUI?
Message-ID: <03D1D2BBD82BFB073965541B@harpo.psc.edu>

Can a module display a dynamic string in its GUI? I couldn't find an example of this in the supplied XML.

The XML for my module's GUI uses a StringEntry widget while the XML for the module's SM uses

         <StringVectorProperty 
            name="ShowReport" 
            command="GetReport"
            number_of_elements="1"
            information_only="1"
         > 
            <SimpleStringInformationHelper/>
         </StringVectorProperty>

The interface for the command is

      char *GetReport( void );

where the body is in the cxx file. The initial value is displayed but subsequent changes are not. Prints added to the "RequestData" and "GetReport" routines show that "GetReport" is called only once, not every time the module updates.

My system:

   OS: 2.6.14-1.1656_FC4 i686
   Compiler: 4.0.2 20051125 (Red Hat 4.0.2-8)

Thanks in advance for any advice!

Any information property needs to be explicitly updated by calling
vtkSMProxy::UpdatePropertyInformation() or its overload. Are you calling
UpdatePropertyInformation every time the module updates?

Utkarsh,

No! Do I call this from RequestData? The documentation for VTK doesn't cover vtkSMProxy, of course. Can you direct me towards documentation? Or will reading the source be sufficient?

Thanks!

Message-ID: <d71426460607120910i5f0387b7r7addad49b0e6151e@mail.gmail.com>

Through TCL scripting I would like to access object attribute data arrays
(eg point tcoords,  cell normal values, etc)

>From proxies i can only gain access to methods from the vtkSMProperty class
and its descendants:

[vtkTemp1102 GetProperty AddScalarVariable ] SetNumberOfElements 15
[vtkTemp1102 GetProperty AddScalarVariable ] SetElement 1 0    .....

but this simply lets me set new types, and return array names and types.

Where is the attribute data array (vtkDataArray) stored within Paraview and
can i gain access to this somehow to return attribute values point by point?

Thank you in advance

pvclient -rc
pvdataserver -rc -ch=displayhost

What happens in this situation?  Does pvdataserver default to the data and

You should simply use pvclient and pvserver.

Subject: [Paraview] Displaying FPS as annotation
Message-ID: <55633.128.165.242.125.1152746747.squirrel@webmail.lanl.gov>

Hello All,

I want to show the framerate of my visualization as part of the corner
annotion.  I see that I can use tcl expressions in these boxes but I'm not
sure how to proceed.  I tried calling ListMethods on the RenderModuleProxy
but it doesn't seem to have any fps-realated methods.  Is there some
simple thing I can do other than... maybe register a certain piece of
timer setup at the start of an animation using the command system, and
place expressions in the corner annotation to read the timer status?  This
feels like a very simple problem

Thanks for the help!

Message-ID: <200607131356.00285.ted@foi.se>

Hello,

When I set the VTK_USE_SYSTEM_ZLIB flag ON, I get errors while building 
Paraview 2.4.4 on a gentoo box. It basically complains about HDF5 looking for 
vtk_zlib.h

If I set the flag off, it complains later on, telling me that there is a 
conflict between the version of zlib.h on my machine and the version of 
zlib.h provided with the Paraview source code.

What am I supposed to do?
Does anyone know?

Hi Adam,

I added polygons/second annotation. Is that enough, or do you actually 
want fps?

Please keep the discussion on the VTK user's list. I'm also copying this 
to the ParaView user's list.

In this case, you might be able to get away with changing the CMake 
settings for the VTK that's contained in ParaView since you're just 
trying to get all the examples to build. However, in general, I would 
recommend *against* changing ParaView's VTK settings; it's too easy to 
mess up your ParaView build while doing that. You can certainly use the 
VTK source code in ParaView for doing an out-of-source build of VTK 
though (i.e., you don't have to download the VTK source code again).

gl2ps. Think this can be built into paraview/vtk. See the vtk mailing list.

Does this happen in an absolutely clean build directory? It sounds like
the sort of thing that happens when you switch back and forth between
the system and included versions.

No. Clean build.
I am trying to write a Paraview .ebuild for gentoo. This means that everytime 
I rebuild Paraview, I restart from the beginning (the old compilation 
directory being erased at the beginning of the process).

Message-ID: <004001c6a71e$99fc15d0$cdf44170$@bau.tu-bs.de>

Dear list,

a short question: Does anybody managed to build ParaView on Visual Studio
2005/AMD64? I tried and applied the patches mentioned in the
VTK-Mailing-List
(http://public.kitware.com/pipermail/vtkusers/2005-December/083148.html)
which helped to build most of the projects, but then failed to link the
binaries. This seems to be a TCL/TK issue, because the 8.4 branch is
supposed not to compile on AMD64 with Visual Studio 2005. I have given up at
this point and would be happy if somebody here has successfully managed to
build a Windows version of ParaView with 64 Bit and could share either the
binaries or the way to go. Thanks in advance.

Best,
Benjamin

I dont think PV supports that. During VTK setup you can turn on using 
gl2ps, which as a stanalone lib works fine for me, but I never tried it 
from under VTK

search the ML, I remember such a thread in the past

Message-ID: <CDDE3AC0-7600-485D-A0D6-0B3E51F7001D@uchicago.edu>

I'm looking for a way to color isosurfaces by the divergence of a  
velocity vector field. It looks like the vtkImageDivergence class is  
the one I need.[1] Please correct me if I'm wrong about that.

To add the vtkImageDivergence class to the ParaView GUI, I tried to  
modify the XML files from the vtkCellDerivatives example in the Wiki. 
[2] My XML files (GUI and SM) are below. They do give me a  
"Divergence" entry in my Filters menu, and the filter will allow me  
to choose an input and Accept. But there is no apparent output from  
the filter. Is this just a syntax error in my XML, or is there  
another problem?

Thanks,
ccg

Hi,

some time ago I tried vtkImageDivergence to compute the vorticity out of a
velocity field. This was before the wiki-page on vtkCellDerivatives was
written.

I am not sure what is wrong with vtkImageDivergence in your case, but I
think you should be able to construct your required field out of the 9
velocity derivatives (du/dx, du/dy, ...) that you get out of the
vtkCellDerivatives filter.

Maybe I am missing something of your requirements, or maybe you didn't
notice the drop-down selection of the vtkCellDerivatives filter. (in your
case the "ComputeGradient" option).

Subject: [Paraview] Conflict with stddef.h when compiling PV on Intel Mac
Message-ID: <3BBC2704-335F-4E3C-8CD6-FC62F5E3088A@tacc.utexas.edu>

Hello,

I am having issues compiling paraview on an Intel MacBook Pro  
(10.4.7).  I am trying to the compile the latest release (2.4.4) with  
cmake 2.2 (also tried cmake 2.4).  I have been following the  
instructions and tips from other posts on this listing about  
compiling and installing PV on an intel mac, in particular I've tried  
these configurations:

http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ 
ParaView:FAQ#How_do_I_compile_ParaView_for_Mac_OS_X.3F (general mac  
configuration)

http://public.kitware.com/pipermail/paraview/2006-March/002717.html  
(Ivan Guajan's configuration, seems to be similar to general mac config)

http://public.kitware.com/pipermail/paraview/2006-May/002982.html  
(Randy Hudson's configuration)

I appear to be having a compile error that no one else has run into,  
or at least posted about.  The error is:

(14:10)/Users/romy/sw/paraview-2.4.4_BIN: make

#endif /* _STDDEF_H or __need_ptrdiff_t.  */

.......

(the line in blue is line #152)

Just to check, I tried pointing to the stddef.h in my /usr/include  
directory (which is slightly different, I'm thinking it's the cc  
version), and I get the same error.  My initial guess is that  
ptrdiff_t is being defined somewhere else, I suppose in Paraview, and  
therefore it's failing when it tries to redefine it here.  I have  
compiled other programs with this gcc, so I don't think its a problem  
with that, but I am confused as to why no one else has run into this  
problem compiling PV on an Intel Mac.  I am using the gcc (and cc)  
that came with the developer tools kit on the disc distributed with  
my mac, it appears to be version 4.0.1.

Any help or suggested fixes would be greatly appreciated, as I am stuck.

Thank you,
Romy Schneider

Message-ID: <50042.128.165.242.125.1153345502.squirrel@webmail.lanl.gov>

Hi All,

I'm looking at the VTK documentation and there seems to be a rich
collection of subclasses of vtkVolumeMapper including many that require no
special hardware.  How come Paraview only with the
vtkUnstructuredGridVolumeMapper side of the family?  I would think that
including all of these other methods would only be as hard as writing some
cxx/xml to wrap them in the server manager and adding some UI switches to
select between them on the client side.   Is there significantly more to
it than this that has kept others from doing it already?

	of zlib.h
Message-ID: <200607200004.05512.daniel.tourde@caelae.se>

Hello,

I am trying to compile "by hand" Paraview 2.4.4 and I encounter a strange 
problem. Hopefully someone can help me with that.

To compile paraview, I follow the installation procedure and under CMAKE 
(2.4.2) I choose:

BUILD_SHARED_LIBS : ON
VTK_USE_SYSTEM_FREETYPE : ON
VTK_USE_SYSTEM_JPEG : ON
VTK_USE_SYSTEM_PNG : ON
VTK_USE_SYSTEM_TIFF : ON
VTK_USE_SYSTEM_ZLIB : ON

When I build Paraview I then get the following error:
In file included from /root/paraview-2.4.4/Utilities/hdf5/H5Zdeflate.c:30:
/root/paraview-2.4.4-linux/Utilities/hdf5/hdf5_zlib.h:1:22: vtk_zlib.h: No 
such file or directory

morghaan paraview-2.4.4-linux # cd /root/paraview-2.4.4-linux/Utilities/hdf5/
morghaan hdf5 # more hdf5_zlib.h
#include <vtk_zlib.h>

I have two Gentoo machines at my disposal:
- One with VTK installed: I get this error message (the file is 
under /usr/include/vtk-5.0 and is apparently never found)
- One without VTK, the file does not even exist...

If I check the source code, I can see that this hdf5_zlib.h is, as a matter of 
fact, generated automatically:
morghaan hdf5 # more hdf5_zlib.h.in
#include <@HDF5_ZLIB_HEADER@>

where 
morghaan hdf5 # more CMakeLists.txt
gives:

IF(NOT HDF5_ZLIB_HEADER)
  SET(HDF5_ZLIB_HEADER "zlib.h")
ENDIF(NOT HDF5_ZLIB_HEADER)
CONFIGURE_FILE(${VTKHDF5_SOURCE_DIR}/hdf5_zlib.h.in
  ${VTKHDF5_BINARY_DIR}/hdf5_zlib.h)


So, I don't really understand why vtk_zlib.h is chosen instead of zlib.h when 
I clearly specify the flag...

Any comment, any help?

Message-ID: <51F75455-4DFA-415D-A8C4-7E30CC98BB74@gmail.com>

Hello,
   Now the Paraview is running on my Intel Mac I am really interested  
in doing some development with it in earnest. The first thing I need  
is a reader to read up our custom data format. I have my notes and  
exercises from a Paraview Class that I attended last year but I think  
I am missing a basic concept.
    My data is a triangle mesh. Within the dataset there are distinct  
"structures" that are completely closed triangles meshes. Each of  
these meshes has a specific color that I want it displayed as. The  
colors are stored in the file.
   I have written a "VTK" loader, ie, I have code that reads the data  
but returns a vtkCollection of vtk3dLODActors. I am guess that  
returning vtkActors may be a bit too high level for Paraview. What  
would be an appropriate data structure to return from my loader?

     Also, does Paraview/VTK have a file format that retains color/ 
material/attribute information for a triangle mesh?
   So for example each completely enclosed triangle mesh, call it a  
"particle", needs a unique ID. The particle will also have a specific  
color/material information associated with it.


Thanks for any help or pointers to information.

Hi Mike,

Why don't you just create a single poly-data or unstructured grid with a 
cell centered scalar field that has a unique scalar for each "particle". 
Then ParaView will use the lookup table and color each "particle" with 
its own color.

The problem of using a collection of actors is that there is some 
overhead of switching from one actor to another, so you get better 
performance if you use a single actor.

Hello,
    I have a pipeline that was developed (Thanks Andy) in paraview  
for a given data set. I now have about 600 of those datasets. I see  
that I can save a session state from paraview and reload it when I  
relaunch Paraview. But the session state seems to be really tied to  
the datafile on disk. What I really want is to be able to load one of  
those data sets, then load up a script that acts on that dataset, not  
the original dataset from the disk.
   How would I best accomplish this.

Thanks

Hi Mike,

Well, sort of. You can figure out what the colors should be, convert 
that to hue range, then make sure that your cell scalars fall in the 
appropriate location in the hue table.

For example, let say you take hue circle (360 deg) and you use unsigned 
char as a scalar field. First you divide 360 with 256 (unsigned char), 
create a bogus cell on 0 and 255, then you take the rest of the data and 
give it appropriate cell values to fall on the right place.

Does this at all makes sense?

       Andy

Hi Mike,

You can write a script that will generate 600 states.

What is really your end result? Do you want to animate? If so, just 
click on timesteps and generate a time series out of your dataset.

Message-ID: <e4fafd990607201012l91b56aq4cd93cdaf677d1fa@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have two 3D images, one being the intensity inverse of the other, produced
using the BinaryThresholdImageFilter.  When I generated the isosurface
rendering using ParaView, both renderings looked almost identical, given the
same contour values.  I would expect one rendering to display features the
other one wouldn't be able to, and vice versa, which is what I want.  How
does ParaView generate isosurfaces?


Thank you,
Kevin

What I want to be able to do is load up one of these data sets and
just apply the pipeline to it. The end result is a Triangle Surface
mesh for 3D viewing and saving.

I actually already have a program written with VTK that does just
this. Except that the program is on one machine and Paraview is on
another. I was hoping that if I could just have the pipeline ready in
a script file, the scientists could bring me their .vti file, and then
I can just apply the script and out pops my triangle mesh complete
with proper coloring and all that.

Also, Time animation is something that we would like to look at doing.
I fiddled with some of it over the weekend but not ready to go much
further with it right now.

I was just hoping to be able to apply a script to an already loaded dataset.

Hi Mike,

ParaView 3 will support this feature. In ParaView 2.* you will have to 
write a script that duplicate state for each dataset with the 
appropriate file name.

Message-ID: <d71426460607201138y476a5ce9r13fa87383cd72a41@mail.gmail.com>

I have created a vtkDrillHoleSource.cxx file (similar to vtkLineSource.cxx)
that will generate a new Source object in Paraview's menu.

I can compile the class without error, and link to the class using the
DrillHoleSourceParaviewImport.cmake file. During the Paraview build, i get
the following errors:

I have both the DrillHoleSource.cxx and .h files in the same directory, yet
it claims it cannot find my header file

Has anyone encountered this problem?

This requires writing a state and then editing it. The state is a Tcl script
so it should be relatively easy to put a loop around it. Just  a warning,
creating 600 pipeline objects in a loop might not work well
performance-wise. I would recommend deleting the pipeline objects at the end
of each iteration.
Also, working with trace as opposed to state might be easier. Trace does not
save out as much info as state.

No wait,
 we are missing my point. My point is that I have an existing Pipeline
defined. I want to be able to apply that pipeline to any dataset that
is loaded up in paraview. Right now I have .vti files of the data. I
also have a program that will convert those .vti files into surface
meshes (Actually, it takes data from an HDF5 file and creates the Mesh
using VTK as the pipeline.) I started dumping VTI files during the
process when I figured out Paraview could read them.

 If there was a way the tcl could get the "currently opened dataset",
then the remainder is cake. But from what I am hearing from this list
is that there isn't a way for the TCL scripting to get at the
currently opened dataset. It must start from a data file on disk. Is
that right?

Hi Kevin,


Since both of your images are binary, and one is the inverse
of the other, it is normal that the iso-contour generated by
ParaView is the same for both images.


This should be the case, regarldess what iso-contour extraction
method you use. But, just for the record, what ParaView uses is
the vtkContourFilter:


      http://www.vtk.org/doc/release/5.0/html/a01263.html



What was your goal when you generated one image as the inverse
of the other ?


There may be a better way to achieve your goal....


   Please let us konw,


      Thanks



          Luis

But, when I start paraview in c/s parallel mode with 4 nodes as servers (mpirun -np 4 pvserver),
and load above .pvts data, only the first 4 pieces are showed on screen. If I use 2 nodes as servers,
also only the first 2 pieces are loaded. 
Why? Any help is welcome.
Thank you!

Hello,

I created the following patch, to try to solve the issue. It is not really 
advanced but I hope it will help... ;)
It is for Paraview 2.4.4
It basically checkes within the PARAVIEW_USE_SYSTEM_HDF5 test, if one uses the 
system zlib or not. It sets HDF5_ZLIB_HEADER accordingly.

Message-ID: <200607211426.27204.ted@foi.se>

Hello,

My first patch gave the expect result. No more issue with vtk_zlib.h with the 
flag VTK_SYSTEM_ZLIB on. I don't know if I solved it the right way but at 
least the problem is gone...

Something else popped up: I had some issue within GUI/Widgets with vtkpng (not 
exisiting, in my case, because I use VTK_SYSTEM_PNG).

To solve this I think the following patch should do the trick:
# diff CMakeLists.txt CMakeLists.txt.org
400,404c400
< IF(VTK_USE_SYSTEM_PNG)
<   TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES (KWWidgets png)

Hello,

The second patch I sent seems to solve the problem mentionned previously in 
this thread. Paraview built successfully on a Gentoo box with the options I 
mentionned in my original email.

It is clear that these two patches need to be carefully tested with different 
compilation flags.

Not sure if this is what you need....

# If you want the currently selected object in the menu
set currentlyViewedObject [[$application GetMainWindow] GetCurrentPVSource]

# Or loop through all menu objects applying your pipeline
set sources [[$application GetMainWindow] GetSourceList Sources]
set num [$sources GetNumberOfItems]

for {set i 0} {$i < $num} {incr i} {
     set eachObject [$sources GetItemAsObject $i]

     # run your pipeline on the eachObject obtained from the list
}

Mike,

set window [$Application GetMainWindow]

# This part reads the first file:
$window WriteVTKFile "/path/to/the/data/foo.vti" 0
set reader [$window InitializeReadCustom "XMLImageDataReader" 
"/path/to/the/data/foo1.vti"]
$window ReadFileInformation $reader "/path/to/the/data/foo1.vti"
$window FinalizeRead $reader "/path/to/the/data/foo1.vti"
set fileName [$reader GetPVWidget {Filename}]
$fileName SetValue "/path/to/the/data/foo1.vti"
$reader AcceptCallback

Or if you have the reader already:

# Populate the variables
set reader [$window GetCurrentPVSource]
set fileName [$reader GetPVWidget {Filename}]

Now you can change the file:

$fileName SetValue "/path/to/the/data/foo2.vti"
$reader AcceptCallback

and again

$fileName SetValue "/path/to/the/data/foo3.vti"
$reader AcceptCallback

Looks good?

Btw, be careful. This will only work if all your datasets are VTI. You 
cannot apply the same pipeline to different type datasets (images versus 
polydata).

You can't do this. TCL does not have direct access to data arrays. This is
because the data array may be in a server process.

Hi Shwan,

Any way you could share the module? There may be a typo somewhere.

Unfortunately, the only way to do this is to add a new sub-class of
vtkPVWidget or vtkPVSource. We will try to make this easier in ParaView 3.

Bingo.. that is exactly what I needed. So replaced the top part of a
trace file with:

set kw(vtkTemp2) [$Application GetMainWindow]
set kw(vtkTemp1015) [[$Application GetMainWindow] GetCurrentPVSource]

and now all I have to do is load up my .vti file (from a very specific
simulation run, the one with 600 data sets) and the pipeline is
applied and I get my mesh. Hurray....

Now, on to figure out how to do the animation with out crashing.

Thanks to everyone that helped.

Thanks, I now have everything compiled successfully.

Although, when i choose my Drill Hole object from the menu, Paraview
crashes, outputting the error:
# Error or warning: There was a VTK Error in file:
/root/ParaView/Servers/Common/vtkProcessModule.cxx (891)
 vtkProcessModule (0xc855b60): Cannot create object of type
"vtkDrillHoleSource".
while processing
Message 0 = New
  Argument 0 = string_value {vtkDrillHoleSource}
  Argument 1 = id_value {508}
ErrorMessage end
ErrorMessage
# Error or warning: There was a VTK Error in file:
/root/ParaView/Servers/Common/vtkProcessModule.cxx (893)
 vtkProcessModule (0xc855b60): Aborting execution for debugging purposes.
ErrorMessage end
Aborted


I found one similar error on the list, but it was in reference to running
pvbatch, which does not affect me (i don't believe).

Is Paraview crashing when executing my vtkDrillHoleSource code (perhaps
logical errors) or at another stage that i am not aware of?

Thank you
-Shawn

Hi Shawn,

Again, could be several things. It would be easy to debug if we could 
see DrillHoleSourceParaviewImport.cmake.

In your case it looks like vtkDrillHoleSource was not wrapped into 
ClientServer.

Thanks Andy

My DrillHoleSourceParaviewImport.cmake file:

SET (DrillHoleSource_SRCS
  ${DrillHoleSource_SOURCE_DIR}/myVTKClasses/vtkDrillHoleSource.cxx
    )
SET (DrillHoleSource_WRAPPED_SRCS
  ${DrillHoleSource_SOURCE_DIR}/myVTKClasses/vtkDrillHoleSource.cxx
    )
INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES(${DrillHoleSource_SOURCE_DIR}/myVTKClasses)

I added to the file:

PARAVIEW_INCLUDE_WRAPPED_SOURCES("${DrillHoleSource_WRAPPED_SRCS}")


Rebuilding, I do not get the same error message any longer.
Unfortunately, a new error arises:

MPI process rank 0 (n0, p6828) caught a SIGSEGV.

Which is an mpirun/lam error.
I have encountered this error in the past, as I beleive it may be
independent of my DrillHoleSource code / module integration.

Any further suggestions, perhaps as to whether this error can be further
tracked?

My system:
2.6.17-1.2139_FC5smp
i686 GNU/Linux
Dual Processor

Thank you

Message-ID: <3ce943600607222253s220a109dqf72e9bab62b3a9ed@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am new user  of ParaView.  My initial impression is
great about ParaView. I am converted from Tecplot
since what I want was very doable in 2D but not 3D.


I have 3D data, and want to put some mark (such
as small shpere and its label together) in 3D field.



in tecplot there is special keyword to specify adding geometry or
text such as (in data file of Tecplot )

for text:
TEXT X=100, Y=20, C=RED, LS=2, T="The text label"

for Geometry:
GEOMETRY T=CIRCLE, X=10, Y=50
100 (radius of the circle)

Unfortunately, these things are available for 2D but not for 3D. However, it
is available in
ParaView.



Lets assume that I have  the following data,

how can I add   (and specification of location, size,...) 3d text or
sphere...  in *.vtk file?

I would be appreciated if you can help me out,

thanks,

Is there any support currently in Paraview for Intersense trackers?  
If not how difficult would it be to add it? And If I add support for  
it now, would that support easily transition to the QT based paraview  
in the future.

During the development of a new module I only need to remake "paraview" - I don't need "pvclient", "pvbatch", etc. What file(s) and assignment(s) would I temporarily change so that only "paraview" is remade? Thanks!

Hi Battalgazi,

I think what you're looking for is vtkGlyph3D. Using a set of points  
with scalar values associated with them, you can display spheres and  
other items easily. Check out the tutorial at:
   http://www.psc.edu/general/software/packages/paraview/tutorial/ 
pvt.php

If you need to generate datasets, I recommend using PolyData, and you  
can find many good examples on how to do that in the VTK documentation.

	custom source module
Message-ID: <d71426460607241057h332b2aa5h6dc5cd8f9a1934b9@mail.gmail.com>

All,

I have built the CVS version 2.5 (from jul 12) successfully with an added
module for a DrillHoleSource object in the menu.

I get the following error when i attempt to select my object from the Source
menu:

#Error or warning: ERROR: In /root/ParaView/VTK/IO/vtkXMLParser.cxx, line
442
vtkPVXMLPackageParser (0x9e3cf98): Error parsing XML in stream at line 21:
not well-formed (invalid token)
ErrorMessage end

Segmentation fault


I have also tried adding an existing Source object (vtkLineSource class
file), taking the same steps to add it to the menu as before. Once again,
Paraview runs and i see the object in the menu, but when i attempt to select
the object i receive the same error.


Any help/suggestions are appreciated.

I just discovered an outstanding bug (#2110 [see 
http://www.vtk.org/Bug/bug.php?op=show&bugid=2110&pos=18]) whose symptom 
resembles the problem I've been having with the paraview file dialog on 
my MacBook Pro and on a couple Linux systems, to wit,

    Since my users won't add an extension to their filenames, I have to
    select my custom reader from a long menu of readers available from
    the file dialog.

    But, on the machines I mentioned, this menu fills the entire screen
    horizontally and extends into the virtual space beyond the screen
    vertically -- without the helpful, vertical-scrolling carets one
    might see on other systems.

    So, while holding down the mouse button, I have to use the vertical
    arrow key to cycle through the reader list to the top or bottom, and
    then count the arrow-keystrokes off-screen to the reader I need (the
    number having been determined by trial and error).

    (I'd have to do the same to select "All Files", since that's
    off-screen, too.)

    Silly.


Is anyone working on this?

Will it only be fixed when paraview goes to Qt?


Thanks.

Hi,
PV colorizes my cells in an unstructured mesh using the x-component of 
the VECTORS field only. I know I can use the calculator filter, but 
isint colorizing by vector magnitude more intuitive as default? Or do I 
make a simple error somewhere?

Hello,

You can always use array calculator to calculate magnitude of vectors.

Yes, I know, but I am thinking if it doesnt make sense to use the 
magnitude by default in PV? Or is it because of memory issues?

Subject: [Paraview] VRML colors
Message-ID: <7CA74926-79A4-4456-BBD9-199414D8617C@rpi.edu>

I have read the paraview FAQ and manual, both which mention that
_only_ the geometry of a VRML/WRL input file is parsed.  But there
are hints from google searches that it may be possible to also have
the color arrays parsed as well.  Does anyone know of a working
example where vertex colors along with geometry are imported properly?

I am working with IndexedFaceset geometry nodes with Vertex centered
colors.

Thanks for any information,
Matt S.

Hi,all,

I updated my paraview from 2.0.1 to 2.4.4, I find that when I use tiled dispay
mode, the image on multi-screens connected to servers is normal but there is nothing showed on my clinet screen.
Why? Is it right?

Also I find that when I use ordinary c/s MPI mode, if I set Composite option to zero, the screens of client and  
the first server both show the whole image and the screens of other servers show the partitions. While, in PV2.0.1,
the first server also shows a part of the whole image.
Who can tell me the reasons of these changes?

Thanks!

Is the problem the fact that x-component is the default or that you can't
color by magnitude at all?

The unconviniency - not a problem - is that x-component is used to 
colorize by default, while I doubt if anyone would ever use such a 
default and anyway calculate the magnitude in the calculator filter.

Unless I am missing something, you can color by magnitude without having to
compute it with a calculator. Simply go to "Edit Color Map" and change which
component/magnitude the surface is colored by. I guess it is an unexpected
location to have that setting. We should probably change the button name to
something like "Edit Color Settings...". We will change the default to be
magnitude in the next release.

All,
 
Color by vector magnitude IS the default. So Dominik must have an old
version of ParaView.
 
(Advanced note: color by vector magnitude is not the default for volume
rendering.... this is because for volume rendering, the magnitude has to
be computed and added to every cell in the dataset...)

Or he has the CVS version. Somehow, it reverted back to be X component. I'll
fix that soon.

I see, yes, you are right, I can chose the magnitude in the edit color 
map. It still would be more natural as default (magnitude instead of 
component) but at least I dont have to manually run the calculator. 
Thank you!

Is it really too old?

Message-ID: <b02264720607280839h32fe9b92te2b2db3907b48f24@mail.gmail.com>

Yesterday I amazed myself with how well paraview runs on our 12-LCD tiled
display.  Awesome work guys :)

But is there any way to account for the Bezel width?  Is there any
configurable parameter to define a "gap" between tiles?

This request is already captured as bug #1132:
http://www.paraview.org/Bug/bug.php?op=show&bugid=1132&pos=1

This actually should not be too hard to implement since the underlying
parallel rendering code already supports mullions.  It's just a matter of
adding some new parameters to pvserver and spacing the tiles out
differently.

This bug has been on my to-do list for, gosh, over a year now.  But, since
we rarely use tile displays anymore and the tile displays that we do have
don't have any spaces or overlap, this has been the lowest priority and I
never get to it.

If someone would like to implement this (hint, hint) and make sure
everything (rendering and annotation) is working correctly, I am perfectly
happy to point to the correct sections of code to change.

In a followup to yesterday's question, is there any way to have the image
that is displayed on the Tiled-display rendered to the local client as

geometry in question is far too big to have the "geometry" send back (Which
it seems there is a "Client Collect" option for), I really just need
framebuffers composited & sent back (Like in the MPIRenderModule).

Is there a way to enable such behavior?  I know the resolution would, of
course, be much worse on the single display but it would help alot in just
knowing what's going on.   Also, it seems the options to "Set Center"
doesn't work on the client unless the geometry is shown (Presumably because
the OpenGL query stuff doesn't work if no geomtry is shown).

Message-ID: <BAY108-F6558167670890C72F04CBC25E0@phx.gbl>

Hi everyone

I am a new user of paraview and I was trying to load an HDF5 file but got 
some problems. First the h5 file is as follows(from h5dump):

HDF5 "TEST.h5" {
GROUP "/" {
   GROUP "TEST_GROUP" {
      DATASET "TEST" {
         DATATYPE  H5T_IEEE_F64LE
         DATASPACE  SIMPLE { ( 18112071, 6 ) / ( H5S_UNLIMITED, 6 ) }
         DATA {
         (0,0): 1.14418e+09, 0.7203, 8.7e+06, 1, 1, 26,
         .......
The data is a 2D matrix, about 18 million rows x 6 cols, what I wanted to do 
is simple, plot a line chart of col 1 vs col 2.

when I loaded the file into paraview(2.4), it was read by 
XMLHierarchicalDataReader1 and it shows up under "selection Window" but 
there is nothing on the "information" tab, all the fields are 0. there is no 
graph shown on the right panel.

please someone help, thanks a lot in advance.

Message-ID: <44CBBB5C.3020809@vision.ee.ethz.ch>

I submitted it once as a minor bug but havent seen it resolved for quite 
some tome now. I can actually do it myself for my own needs, but dont 
know how to do it right: where to put the following line in the source 
code to get e.g. edges displayed right in a tet mesh?

#ifdef GL_VERSION_1_1
   glEnable(GL_POLYGON_OFFSET_FILL);
   glPolygonOffset (1., 1.);
#endif

of the VTK's way:

SetResolveCoincidentTopologyToPolygonOffset()

It is apparently missing in my cvs version. Could someone quickly tell 
me where to add this to the source code?

thanks
Dominik

Sorry, but there is no mechanism for creating reduced size image to
deliver to the client when in tile display mode.  ParaView does,
however, send a reduced sized geometry to the client when LOD is
enabled.  You may want to try playing with the "LOD resolution" and
"Client Collect" options to try to get a nice reduced geometry to the
client.

Awww comeon, I know that's not true :)  I was at Sandia less than a Year ago
and I saw you guys using it in your new spiffy panoram room.  :)

So what's the magic trick?

No Ken is right.
 
You can get a reduced geometry at your client, but you cannot get an
image (while simultaneously displaying on a tiled display). If you think
about it, it would mean that paraview would have to do two compositing
passes, one for the tiled display and one for the client composite
image.
 
Having the reduced geometry on the client side, seems to work just fine

No, really.  That has never been implemented (as far as I know).  You
probably saw geometry delivered to the client.  It was only about a year
ago that I added the client collect option.  Before that, geometry was
always delivered to the client.

Dominik,

Shoving in glpolygon offset is one of those 'features' that may shoot
you in the foot 6 ways from Sunday. ParaView does lots of complicated
stuff (tiled display, image compositing, volume rendering, probing,
etc...). Adding in an offset is one of those things which would have to
be AOK'd by the principal developers and would probably involve some
discussion first. :)

I know this is probably unsatisfying but why not just set your line
width to 2? It works great. :)

See, that's the trick.. "Reduced" Geometry on the client.  How do I get this
mystical "reduced" geometry on the client,w ith full-rez on the display?

No matter what I set "Client collect" to, my 60+ million triangle surface is
shown as mere bounding boxes to the client.

Try unchecking the checkbox next to client collect.  Be warned that this
will send the reduced geometry to the client no matter what.  Not all
surfaces are susceptible to the decimation, so your client may end up
with a lot of data.

You can get a reduced geometry at your client, but you cannot get an
image (while simultaneously displaying on a tiled display). If you think
about it, it would mean that paraview would have to do two compositing
passes, one for the tiled display and one for the client composite
image.

 

Having the reduced geometry on the client side, seems to work just fine
(that is what you saw here at Sandia :)
