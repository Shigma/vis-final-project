Subject: [Paraview] vtk file format?
Message-ID: <LIEKKABJFKEGAINOHCHNKEGHCAAA.peter.welsh@vips.co.uk>


I read in a .vtk file which contains only the topology of my model.

I then wish to read in the data for the model at different timesteps (again
using .vtk format), is this possible, without having to include the topology
of model again in these data files?

Hi Peter,
Can't answer your question directly but it seems that we both would like
to visualize time step data. I have data at 150 different time steps and
would like to run ParaView in the batch mode saving images at the
different time steps, do you run in the batch mode when you have data at
different time steps? I have another excellent free source graphics tool
that I use but would like to be able to use ParaView as well. With the
other tool, using the other package I can create  geometry link to a
single topology but I cannot not run in batch. I run it interactively
repeating the same commands at each time step. It does not take too long
but it is not as efficient as running in the batch mode and I have seen
ParaView questions concerning the batch mode, does anyone have a link to
find out more about the batch mode?

Nope. It doesn't. Currently, we have no documentation describing how.

Unfortunately, it is not. I do not know of any VTK reader that lets you
do that.

Hi,

I just discovered that naming your vtk files a_name.0.vtk, =
a_name.1.vtk,
a_name.2.vtk, a_name.3.vtk, a_name.4.vtk, etc...  and opening one in
ParaView creates a little timebar in the left panel.
Maybe you can use scripts to change the timestep, simulate clicking on
Accept and save your images.

Hope this helps

This sounds like a bug. I'll take a look.

What .tcl script? You mean .pvb script? Unless you are using an old old
version of ParaView (0.6), there should be no .tcl scripts.

You setup your animation, save a batch script and load it back with
the --batch command line.

Dear all

I read some documents about loading PLOT3D

Then, how can I convert this unformatted
PLOT3D file into VTK file or how can I
make the formatted PLOT3D file from FORTRAN?
How do I set the output format in FORTRAN

I will appreciate it if you attach the actual

Hi all,
 
I am trying to make a cut of 3D and 2D cells in one Unstructured grid in
ParaView.
The problem is that it is possible to cut only if there is no data on cells
(which is not very useful obviously ;-).
 
Here is a tiny vtk file that shows the bug : it is a triangle and a line and
I'd like to cut them in order to get a line and a point. It works when I
removed the CELL_DATA part.
 
Thanks for your help

Hi Julien,

The problem is in cell->Contour(...) (or maybe in the way vtkCutter is=20
using cell->Contour(...)).  What's happening is that when the cell contours=
=20
itself, it adds a new cell as necessary to the appropriate cell array=20
(verts, lines, or polys), which returns the id of the cell in that array.=20
Contour then uses that id to copy cell data to.  The problem is that if=20
your data set has different types of cells, then the first vertex, line,=20
and polygon inserted will all have the same cell id.  I'll add this as a=20
bug report for VTK.

Message-ID: <Law10-F54r0DPYxy9OE0006a3bb@hotmail.com>

Dear all

I read some documents about loading PLOT3D
file in ParaView. And I knew that unformatted
PLOT3D file cannot be ready by ParaView.
Then, how can I convert this unformatted
PLOT3D file into VTK file or how can I
make the formatted PLOT3D file from FORTRAN?
How do I set the output format in FORTRAN
to produce the formatted PLOT3D file?
I will appreciate it if you attach the actual
example which shows that method.

Yours sincerely ,
                Ilias

They have the same problem because vtkCutter (superclass of=20
vtkKitwareCutter) handles the unstructured grid case for vtkKitwareCutter.

Salut Mathieu,

I didn't use any pipeline, I just made a .vtk file with no point data =
at all
(see the file at the end of my first email). But in paraview, it's =
possible
to do it using the PointDataToCellData filter with the option "Pass =
Point
data" unchecked.

I am not using the quadratic cells (I tried but I had polygons going =
away)
and actually I didn't want to contour a cell, I just wanted to cut it! =
I
think too that it is a non-sense to contour a cell that has scalar =
value
defined on the whole cell.
But I saw in the source code that the vtkCutter uses a trick to cut =
cells:
it assigns values to vertices and asks the cell to contour according to
these values.

Salut Julien,

	Just for curiosity. Waht is the pipeline you use to get cell scalars

(but no points scalars). BTW the quadratic cells in VTK are by design=20
not meant to use cell scalars but point scalars and actually do=20
interpolation. Just think of this: how do you contour a cell that has=20
the same scalar value for every cell ?

Thanks
Mathieu

Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.56.0402182015070.3892@caip.rutgers.edu>

Hi,

I have been using ITK to output some deformation fields and tried to use
paraview to visualize the deformation vectors. I based this on this post
by Luis Ibanez

http://www.itk.org/pipermail/insight-users/2003-December/005865.html

However, I have been unable to get this to work properly. Firstly, I do
not get an option to set the scale mode to scalar. I tried all the other
options and still don't see anything. If I set the scale to "Dat Scaling
Off", I can see the allows, but they are all aligned in the same direction
(+ve X axis). My deformation fields are all right, because I wrote it out
like and image (x,y,z = r,g,b) and it does display something ...

What do I need for the glyph to display properly.

thanks,
-Hari

PS: I used ExtractGrid in place of ExtractVOI.

Hi Hari,


You probably are using now ParaView 1.2.1
(which is an updated release).

       http://www.paraview.org


A couple of things have changed in ParaView since
the message below was posted in december 2003.


For example:


1) Now you can read MetaImage fileformat directly
    (they can contain scalar or vector images)

2) ExtractVOI is now called ExtractGrid
    (as you already noticed)


The simple way of visualizing deformation fields now is to
load your MetaImage file containing the vector image and
directly select the filter "Glyph", and in the options of
the glyph filter set:

   a) Orient Mode = Vector
   b) Scale Mode  = Vector Magnitude
   c) Scale Factor = play with this value to scale your vectors


The reason for using ExtractGrid is to subsample the original
vector image. This is only needed if your deformation field
has a large number of pixels (~ high resolution). Otherwise
you can simply use the Glyph filter connected directly at the
output of the reader.



Please let us know if you find any problems.



Thanks


    Luis

Hi all,

How can this be done? Do I have to write a tcl script in the animation 
editor and how would this look like?.

Currently, this is a little tricky. We definitely want to remedy this by
improving the animation editor in the future. For now, here is what you
can do:
> Add a script as an action (the Source does not matter)
> Write a script (I recommend cutting and pasting since the script
editor is not that good) that gets the render view and sets the right
camera position:
[[$Application GetMainWindow] GetMainView] SetCameraState p0 p1 p2 fp0
fp1 fp2 fp3 up0 up1 up2

where p -> position, fp -> focal position, up -> up vector

Hi Luis,

thanks, it works. I was wondering if it was possible to visualize the
deformation field as a deformed grid., i.e., zero deformation means a
normal structured grid, and to this I apply my deformation field.

Is this possible in Paraview ?

thanks,

Anyone know how to do carpet plots in ParaView?  (By this I mean a 2
dimensional grid, and then displacing in the z direction based on a scalar
variable).

Load the 2D grid  as a structured grid and warp it (not WarpVector,
WarpScalar). If the data is image data or rectilinear grid, you have to 
convert it to a structured grid. Currently there is no filter that does
this but it is easy to write one.

Hi,
I am trying to build Paraview 1.2 "Release" using VC++ 6 with all the =
patches installed on a XP box.  But the build fails with

  Generating Code...
  Compiling...
  vtkWarpTransformTcl.cxx
  vtkWedgeTcl.cxx
  vtkWindowTcl.cxx
  vtkWindowLevelLookupTableTcl.cxx
  vtkXMLFileOutputWindowTcl.cxx
  vtkWin32OutputWindowTcl.cxx
  vtkTclUtil.cxx
  Generating Code...
  Error executing cl.exe.

  ALL_BUILD - 1 error(s), 0 warning(s)

Any ideas what could be wrong?

thanks,

There is no need to write you own structured grid conversion filter.
The filter CleanToGrid will convert image data or rectilinear grid to 
structured grid.
Warp can then be used to create the carpet plot.

We are considering offering a ParaView workshop. I'll provide more
information later.

Hi,
I'm having trouble replicating test results as displayed on the dartboard. 
Below are the first few lines of the output from 'make test'. The first 
couple dozen tests pass, and nearly everything afterwards fails. Two tests 
('TestQuantizeto16Colors-image' and the first 'TestXML') seem to hang 
indefinitely.

This is on Linux with gcc 3.2.2, type=Debug, but I'm getting similar behavior 
with type=Release and on Mac OS X 10.3 and OSF1, all with g++. I wonder if 
I'm using the right compiler? It's not obvious to me which versions of the 
compilers are exercised on the dartboard.

Thanks,
Lee

Can you try 
ctest -V
instead of "make test"? This should give us more information on why the
tests are failing.

Hi all

I am trying to build paraview from cvs and have my own build of vtk4.5.0.
I get the following error
../ParaView/ParaView/vtkClientCompositeManager.cxx: In member
   function `virtual void 
vtkClientCompositeManager::SatelliteStartRender()':
../ParaView/ParaView/vtkClientCompositeManager.cxx:626: no 
matching
   function for call to `vtkRenderWindow::GetScreenSize()'
Building object file vtkPVServerObject.o...

***********************
I know that GetScreenSize() is a method of vtkRenderWindow so that leads 
me to believe that my vtk is not compiled properly for use with paraview.


also is paraview using hdf5 internally, I see that it is trying to compile 
hdf libraries!


Thanks


Leila

Your VTK must not be up-to-date. To compile CVS ParaView, you need
CVS VTK of the same time.

ParaView includes an hdf5 distribution because it has a simple hdf5
reader.

Message-ID: <4EB6E1738CC2E940BAD2EFBFBF5A38F101C3B135@OREADE.ipsn.fr>

Hello,

I have tried to compile Paraview (both 1.0.4 and 1.2.1) on a Compaq Tru64
5.1 (OSF1).
Compilation worked fine but when I launch paraview, I get a segmentation
fault.
vtk that has been compiled with paraview seems to be working.

Does anyone have experienced ParaView on OSF ?

Thanks,

I have had this and other problems with my Red Hat 9.0. My system admin 
said that it is not supported by Red Hat and that we should move away 
from Red Hat 9 because it causes too many problems.

we finally purchased the Entreprise version of Red Hat (or whatever the 
name is, I am not the sys admin here). That is not free anymore, but it 
should solve all these problems.

my 2 cents,

I suggest that you get ParaViewComplete source (release 1.2 from
http://www.paraview.org/HTML/Download.html) and start from scratch
(building out-of-source is the recommend way). If you don't have to
build from source, you are even better off using the binary
distribution.

Hi Jean

Thanks for the info. I have had redhat 9.0 for a while and I have a number 
of other things vtk, itk some other applications all running fine and I do 
all my programming on my linux machine. so I do not think getting rid of 
redhat9.0 is my solution, perhaps I will try to get paraview working 
through some other trick!

Hi Berk

Thanks very much for trying to help me. I am just gonna tell you why I am 
trying to use paraview see what you think.

I ( and my collaborator) have designed and coded a new file format which 
sits on top of hdf5, it is a new generation of minc(developed at Montreal)
we have used the blocking and compression mechanism built in hdf5 and 
came up with our own multi-resolution algorithm.
I already have a viewer which sits over vtk and atamai classes and reads 
the old minc files but caches everything. 
I checked the web and saw that there is already a vtkhdfreader so I can 
try rewriting that for reading and writing my minc2 files but my biggest 
challenge is caching! 
I heard about paraview on the itk list and read about it and 
found out that it reads hdf files and it is also designed for large files 
so I am hoping to get some of the smart caching ideas by using it and 
looking through the code.

sorry for writing a long e-mail

I'm a research scientist at NCSA and was asked about possible topics
for access grid sessions. You can find out access grid and see the list of 
past seminars at 
http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Divisions/eot/Training/Events/PastEvents.html

I suggested paraview and saw this thread. I'm wondering if the 
developers/experts would be interested in participating such programs. The 
session could be a day-long tutorial/training or couple-of-hour seminars 
covering various aspects of paraview.

The seminars are broadcasted over many participating sites at the 
universities, labs and industry. Let me know if anyone is interested in or 
have any question/suggestion.

Surprisingly that's all the error there was.  I have since modified the
cmake config to include full path of the compiler as well as few other minor
path changes.  The problem seems to have resolved itself by I personally
think this machine is just too unstable and it was the multiple reboots that
fixed the problem rather than my config changes.

thanks for trying,
Arash

Hello,

I would like to know if the following is a feature or a bug : when
trying to open an Ensight Gold file (*.case),

- all the corresponding Ensight subsidiary files contained in the
same folder where also opened in ParaView 0.6

- only the *.case file is opened in ParaView 1.2.1

Thank you in advance for your answers.

Best regards,

Sylvain

I am not sure I understand. What do you mean by "opened"? You mean that
only the *.case files show up in the file dialog?

The data is cell data.  It seems that the resultant array is point data,
however.  When I try to display the resultant array I get an error

Is this a bug?  Or am I misunderstanding how to use the calculator?

Hi Robert,

What version of ParaView are you using? (I just tried to reproduce this 
behavior in ParaView 1.2 on a sample data set and was unable to do so.) Can 
you tell me specifically what steps you took and what the error message was?

Message-ID: <BAY7-F224kJSFsxf4yp000130b6@hotmail.com>

To be more accurate :

- version 0.6 : "File -> Open -> foo.case" adds the content
of foo.case to the Object List, but also adds the content
of the surrounding foo.* files (the "*" is different from "case"
for these surrounding files) to the object list.

- version 1.2.1 : "File -> Open -> foo.case" does only add
the content of "foo.case" to the object list, but not that of
the other "foo.*" files.

As the extension of the surrounding files is different from "case",
I cannot open them individually.

I hope I was clearer.

Best regards,

Sylvain

Subject: [Paraview] Time series problem
Message-ID: <1349.128.165.144.120.1077819391.squirrel@webmail4.pair.com>

I'm having trouble reading in a series of files.  This is with the latest
Paraview, version 1.2, release 1.  I'm using legacy VTK format, not sure
if that matters.

I set up a sequence of files: File0.vtk, File1.vtk, File2.vtk... FileN.vtk

If N <= 99, everything works fine.  When I open File0.vtk I get a slider
which allows me to easily open any other file in the series.  I can also
easily set up an animation to loop over all files in the series.

If N>=100, Paraview does not detect the series when I open File0.vtk.  To
open the other files I have to open them individually.  I do not get the
slider to let me easily open any file in the series, and I cannot get the
animator to loop over the whole series.

I did not have any of these problems with my previous version (1.0 release
4?).

Thanks,
-robert

Hi everyone 

Just wanted to let everyone know that I have had the above error when 
building paraview for the past couple of days and lots of links on the web 
mentioned that there is some kind of a bug with glibc and redhat9.0 which 
creates this error.

I was trying to add an extra class to vtk today and was linking against 
the libraries sitting at my home/lib where I noticed the same error. 

so it turned out that I had build my home copy of gcc 2 years ago and when 
I updated to redhat9.0 and it came with gcc-3.2.2, I forgot to remove 
those old libraries from home/lib.

and paraview builds successfully!

thought you guys might like to know

I can't see the output of an AVS file. It is accepted but i 
can't see the grid. It says that the number of cells is 0. Why?

Thank you,
   Delia.

What I've done in the past is simply name the files with a numeric
series:
 File0.vtk, File2.vtk ...

When I open File0.vtk I get a slider so I can access any of the other
files in the series.  In addition, I can choose the "Animation"
control from the "View" menu.  There, I make an action with the source
as the File0 object (it's available in the pull-down menu), and for
the parameter I choose "Filename".  That's enough to create an
animation through the time series.

Under the latest release, this does not work for me if I have more
than 100 files in the series.

No, haven't done anything with mpi mode.
