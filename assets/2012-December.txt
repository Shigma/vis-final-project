Burlen

The inspector is great and I've been using it extensively to monitor some of the big jobs I've run recently. It really helps knowing how much memory you've actually used on each node - and more importantly, how close you are to getting a job killed.

Thanks for taking the time to contribute it.

JB

Documentation for the new memory inspector panel can be found here:

http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Memory_Inspector_Panel

The new panel reports per-process usage and provides some additional debugging tools. It should be available in the 3.98 release.

Here is the script that you should run

from paraview.simple import *

data = XMLPolyDataReader( FileName=['/.../file.vtp'] )

smooth = Smooth(data)
smooth.NumberofIterations = 200

writer = CreateWriter("foo.ply", smooth)
writer.FileType = 'Ascii'
writer.UpdatePipeline()

Sebastien:

Thank you!

That indeed what I was looking for.

Is there a place where one can find out about (look up) such things?

I spent an hour or so yesterday trying to guess  writer.FileType='Ascii'.

My apologies for not including a subject line on my first submission, and
for any confusion
due to trying to send a file that is too large. New to the mailing list.

Thanks again!

Regards,
Tim

Hi John, Thanks! That's great to know, very glad to hear you've found it 
useful.

Sebastien:

As a follow up:

Using    writer.FileType = 'Ascii'     did work to complete the script
generated by Trace. (first_stab.py)

On the other hand, the script you sent did not work, as sent.

By comparing the two scripts, and removing/adding back lines of code, the
only line I needed to
add to your (stand-alone, rather than Trace-generated) script is:

DataRepresentation3 = Show()

after smoothing.  With that line, the slightly modified version of the
script you sent is:

from paraview.simple import *
nanocone_pvd_1_vtp = XMLPolyDataReader(
FileName=['/home/tscale/pv_sims/results/nanocone_pvd_1.vtp'] )
Smooth1 = Smooth()
Smooth1.NumberofIterations = 200
DataRepresentation3 = Show()
writer = CreateWriter("foo2.ply",Smooth1)
writer.FileType='Ascii'
writer.UpdatePipeline()
del writer

(Note that I changed the name of the imported data in your script, and
added del writer at the end.)

I have no clue as to what this line does, but if it is not there, the
following message (among a lot of
other output) appears:
vtkSMWriterFactory (0xc89c10): No matching writer found for extension: ply

Subject: [Paraview] ParticlePathLines Filter
Message-ID: <50BA527D.1030404@ovgu.de>

Hello,

in Paraview 3.98 the ParticlePathLines Filter is gone away. We use this 
to show the trajectory of simple particle data (x,y,z), based on ID. Is 
this intended ?

I got it back by copy & paste the proxysource from filter.xml in 3.14 
(line 6679++) to 3.98. Would it be possible to add back the old 
ParticlePathlines Filter (with single inputsource and Pathline & 
Particle as output) in 3.98 because I love the webGL scene export in the 
new Paraview.

Thanks,
Christian

You can use the completion in the Python shell of ParaView.
Otherwise, you will have to look into the XML file in the source code
repository at the following
path: src/ParaViewCore/ServerManager/SMApplication/Resources/*.xml
to get the list of properties available for each object/proxy that you can
build.

To figured out writer.FileType, I've used

print str(writer.ListProperties())

Thanks Burlen,

I've moved your doc inside the User guide on the wiki.
I'll regenerate the PDF of the User Guide for the coming release which will
include your contribution.

Thanks again,

Message-ID: <CALF6qJmidCSL4iOOOKYicPOKt-jE9CETXiwi=oUH0qt6kmpkoQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

is it possible to enable OGG-support in the newest version of Paraview?
There is a PARAVIEW_ENABLE_FFMPEG option for AVI-files, but I
cannot find something similar for OGG-Theora.

Thanks,

Anton

Sebastien,

Thanks for putting it in the right place. This morning I've merged the 
new docs with the old in the user guide to clean it up a bit. I wasn' t 
sure how important having a consitent look was (eg dialogs/windows in 
mac style), so I left the old images in the source but commented out in 
case that is important to you guys.

Hello,

I'm getting really confused by the PointDatatoCellData / PlotOverLine
filters.
If I generate a point then
    --> pass it to the glyph filter to produce a simple Box
    --> add a point data value to this box with the Calculator
    --> PointDatatoCellData the result
    --> PlotOverLine the value

I obtain a discontinuous line (it doesn't interpolate through the box).
What am I doing wrong?

Many thanks in advance,

Hi,

I use PV with a python script for the post-treatment of large range of data
and save several images.
My problem is that when I run my python script in an IDLE, for each saved
image an OpenGL window is opened.
I tried view.UseOffscreenRenderingForScreenshots = 0  to get rid of these
windows, but without success.

Does anyone know how i can remove these windows?

PS : I?m using PV 3.12.0 in Windows Seven

Thanks in advance!

	centred solution
Message-ID: <1354533375.8095.YahooMailNeo@web114506.mail.gq1.yahoo.com>

Dear All,
I have a node centered solution for my problem using an unstructured hybrid (tetra, prism) grid. And so I have the value of density (only one value - as it scalar) at each node location in the ASCII file of the result.


I am calculating the density gradient using the Compute Derivative option and I get the magnitude and three gradients (in x , y and z direction).

My question is how the three gradients (in x, y and z direction) are calculated in a node -centered unstructured grid ?

Is it right that first, the cell centered value (absolute density) is calculated from the node centers via interpolation and then the gradients from the cell centered value?

I could find the reference (below) for a hexahedral mesh, but not for an unstructured mesh.

Amit

Hi,

I made an animation over my data and plot some data in line chart view.
When I play the animation, chart automatically adjusts its scales (over

Is there any manner to switch off the automatic scaling of a chart view ?

We've been working on a long-lived branch in the stage repository
(stage/13598-VRGrabWorldFix) that should fix this issue. Let me know
if you get a chance to test it, otherwise it should get merged into
master before too much longer.

If you just want to patch the code yourself, you can get the plugin to
compile by adding:

TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES (VRPlugin pqApplicationComponents)

to the bottom of Plugins/VR/CMakeLists.txt.

This shouldn't be calling MPI_Finalize() as the finalizedExternally
argument is 1 and in vtkMPIController::Finalize():

    if (finalizedExternally == 0)
      {
      MPI_Finalize();
      }

So my guess is that it's being invoked elsewhere.

I've made a patch which should prevent this second of code from ever
being called twice by setting the FinalizeMPI flag to false after
calling MPI_Finalize(). Can you take a look here:
http://review.source.kitware.com/#/t/1808/ and let me know if that
helps the issue.

Otherwise, would you be able to set a breakpoint on MPI_Finalize() and
get a backtrace of where it gets invoked for the second time? That
would be very helpful in tracking down the problem.

Thanks,
Kyle

Thanks for bringing this up. Dave already replied to your email. We are in
the final stage of pushing the best VR Plugin in next few weeks. Our goal
is to create best user experience possible given our funding and time
constraints. Could you please tell us more on how you are using the VR
Plugin?

Thanks,

Hi everyone,

I've been trying so far unsuccessfully to compile paraview and I'm not sure what the error message means. 


The compiler gets about half way done up to this point:
[ 52%] Building CXX object VTK/Rendering/Matplotlib/CMakeFiles/vtkRenderingMatplotlib.dir/vtkMatplotlibMathTextUtilities.cxx.o

Then he gives me a lot of warnings about converting to 'int' from 'double' and these eventually turn into error messages. Am I missing a plug-in or something?
Thanks for the help! I've attached the full error message to the bottom of the email.

Subject: [Paraview] ANN: ParaView 3.98.0 is available for download
Message-ID: <CABObKxd7mOuykNzjg+ovJd52WiE6m8YzLS3tdzo+W5NaSitH0Q@mail.gmail.com>

*Folks,

ParaView 3.98.0 is now available for download
(http://paraview.org/paraview/resources/software.php). This is slated to be
the
final major release in the 3 series, hence the dramatic change in version
number since the last release
(3.14.1). If needed, we will have patch release(s) before the 4.0 release.
These release notes give a summary of the major changes in this release,
which address more than 300 issues (
http://paraview.org/Bug/changelog_page.php).

Exporting to PS/PDF: One of the most requested features on ParaView User
Voice (http://paraview.uservoice.com) was to add support for vector
graphics. With this release, it is now possible to export scenes from 3D
views and charts as postscript, eps, pdf, or svg vector graphics. All text
and annotations such as scalar bars, cube-axes, and curves in charts are
exported as vector graphics, thus ensuring crisp reproduction for
publications. 3D surfaces and volumes, however, must remain embedded as a
rasterized image in the resulting output file.

Math-text in annotations: The second most requested feature on ParaView
User Voice (http://paraview.uservoice.com) was the ability to add
mathematical markup to annotation text. ParaView can now use the equation
rendering support in the matplotlib package to generate mathematical
equations in selected text fields. Only categorical scalar bar annotations
support this feature at the moment, but future releases will extend this
capability to all text fields.

Transparent surfaces: Another highly requested feature was the ability to
specify the opacity mapping when coloring surfaces with scalars, which is
added in ParaView 3.98.0. The 'Color Scale Editor' dialog adds the ability
to specify the opacity functions for surfaces.

Redesigned 'Properties' panels: With the 3.98.0 version, we have revamped
the panels used to specify filter properties and display parameters.
Instead of using separate panels, we now have a combined 'Properties' panel
that by default shows a subset of commonly used properties for filters. For
more control, users can easily switch to an advanced view. The updated
panel also adds the ability to search for properties by name.

Improved AMR support: AMR (adaptive mesh refinement) data structures were
completely redesigned for improved performance and memory efficiency.  It
is now possible to volume render AMR datasets. Additionally, we have added
support for multi-resolution streaming of AMR datasets for adaptive volume
rendering.

Simplified 'Find Data': The 'Find Data' dialog, used for querying datasets,
has been simplified with the ability to specify complex queries for
advanced users. Commonly used operations such as min, max, and mean are now
accessible from the simplified interface.

New slice-based views: Two new views have been added to simplify data
exploration using orthogonal slices: Slice and Quad view. The Slice view
allows the user to quickly create, delete, and move any arbitrary slice
along a given axis using an interactive user interface. The Quad view
enables the user to explore a dataset using three slices that get
independently rendered in their own 2D view while a 3D view lets the user
see slices? positions in 3D space.

Modularization of VTK/ParaView: In the past few months, VTK was
restructured to use a modularized approach for building various components
of the toolkit. ParaView's build infrastructure was revamped to make use of
this. It is now possible to build variants of the ParaView library while
picking and choosing
modules from VTK that are of interest, while removing those that are not.
Thus developers are able to build small, lightweight VTK and ParaView
packages ideal for co-processing.

Improved co-processing: Catalyst (http://catalyst.kitware.com) leverages
the VTK and ParaView modularization by allowing users to simplify which
parts of VTK and ParaView to link simulation codes to for in
situprocessing. Note that Catalyst should be considered beta
functionality. In
addition, the co-processing library was modified to add in extra Python
methods that give a cleaner look to the GUI generated scripts. Due to
changes in ParaView though, scripts created with ParaView 3.14.1 that
generate screenshots will not work with ParaView 3.98. ParaView 3.14.1
generated co-processing scripts that only output extracts (i.e. data files)
should work fine with ParaView 3.98.

This version of ParaView includes an experimental interface to GPGPU
processing in Los Alamos National Lab's PISTON (
http://viz.lanl.gov/projects/PISTON.html) library. The interface takes the
form of a plugin (which must be compiled from source) that exposes Piston's
on-GPU implementations of the slice, threshold and iso-contour algorithms
while minimizing transfers between the CPU and GPU.

Every release of ParaView includes several excellent contributions from the
community, and this release is no different. The 3.98.0 release includes a
completely redesigned 'Memory Inspector' panel that can be used to keep
track of memory usage across all ParaView processes, including remote
processes (thanks to Burlen Loring at Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory). Moreover, a new ParaView reader plugin for LANL's GMV file
format has been added (thanks to Sven Buijssen at TU Dortmund University)
that supports a wider set of keywords than the current one from VisItBridge.

As always, we look forward to your feedback (paraview.uservoice.com).

Subject: [Paraview] Trying to run the servers on parallel
Message-ID: <FA295B56FB8E4DCAA75BD1D7E9F0D95B@HackelPC>

Hello community,

This is my first e-mail to the mailing list, so I hope I do it right :-)
And sorry for my english, I try my best to make my mail understandable. If you can I would be pleased if you answer in german. Also I want you to know that I haven?t a great knowledge about informatics.

Well I try to use Paraview on parallel, but I think it doesn?t work right how I do it.
I use a remote PC on which I will run the Paraview client and a extern server with up to 48 CPUs and good GPUs.
So I start the server using ?mpirun ?np ?number? ../pvserver? or ?mpirun ?np ?number? ../pvserver ?display localhost:0? (my Paraview is compiled with openmpi on a linux system). Then I connect over the remote PC in Paraview to this server (client/server mode).
It works, but not well. I?ve got test data (about 1GB) and it takes about two minutes to change for example the filter from outline to wireframe. Also when I want to move the image with drag and drop it takes about five seconds to rerender it. I think for only 1GB it takes too long for doing this.
Also I?m not sure if my server uses its GPUs or only its CPUs, I don?t know how to find it out. 
Would it be better to use my remote PC only as a display?
Could you tell me how Paraview scales with  the number of data sets and number of processes. Should I use ?x? processes to load ?x? data sets? Or is it better to use more processes than data sets (for example: Would it be better to use 8 processes for loading 6 data sets than using 6 processes?)
Is there another way how I could start my server that it will work better? Or what can I change that it will work better?

I hope you can help me a little bit and give me tips how I should use Paraview on parallel. Thanks.


Greetings,

Kevin

Hello all,

I am getting the following error when trying to start in multi-core mode


Generic Warning: In /Users/kitware/Dashboards/MyTests/NightlyMaster/ParaViewSuperbuild-Release/paraview/src/paraview/ParaViewCore/ServerManager/Core/vtkSMSession.cxx, line 266

Failed to automatically launch 'pvserver' for multi-core support. Defaulting to local session.


I can run in multicore mode if I compile the super build on my local machine, but the released version of 3.98 will not start.

Subject: [Paraview] VR-Plugin (VRPN connection) linker error
Message-ID: <002101cdd1f6$1015da40$30418ec0$@tu-cottbus.de>

Hello,

@David:
thank you very much for that hint. The linker error is gone :-).

@Aashish:
We have a Virtual Environment with two back-projected walls. Each wall (2.6 m x 1.625 m) is lit by two projectors for stereoscopic presentations. Furthermore we use an infra-red tracking system from A.R.T with their VRPN server implementation to provide ParaView with tracking data. Beside a head target we use a so called Flystick. It has 6 DOF pose data, a small joystick and 6 Buttons and want to use to manipulate the view. 

The head tracked representation of a ParaView scene is really great. We have increased the depth perception, by building a virtual (background) scene. It is basically a room which extends the back projection space in, so the user seems to look through a window in room. This virtual scene is the starting point for building visualizations. Usually, our visualizations floating at the center of that room. The downside of this approach is to scale down large objects to fit in the view space which is not a big deal in our case. Another drawback is that we cannot use the camera manipulation. Rotating the camera would lead to a rotation of the entire scene (including the virtual background). 

Unfortunately, the current styles are limited to manipulate the virtual camera transformation, rather than single objects. But I saw in git that the geometry representation API has been extended to provide access to its transformation. Is it planned to have a VR style which manipulates the transformation matrix of a geometry object directly?

Cheers,
Stephan

Hello,

I?ve tried recently the new VR-Plugin with GUI support and I have to say at first: Thank god for having a GUI to configure VR(PN) related things.. ? Furthermore, I want to give a small advice: During linking of that plugin a linker error occurs. It says that

?pqSaveStateReaction::saveState();? and ?pqLoadStateReaction::loadState();?

cannot be linked (missing symbols).

Thanks for bringing this up. Dave already replied to your email. We are in the final stage of pushing the best VR Plugin in next few weeks. Our goal is to create best user experience possible given our funding and time constraints. Could you please tell us more on how you are using the VR Plugin?

Thanks,

Subject: [Paraview] trigger a custom panel function/slot after apply button
Message-ID: <50BDCDF2.4090306@ec-nantes.fr>

Hello,

I have custom panel (c++filter), and I want to recover some data from 
the filter AFTER the filter is applied.
for example, set a position in the custom panel, Apply button, search 
the closest point in the input mesh, and (this is the difficult part), 
show the point position in the panel.

I tried something like  this in my panel but it does not work.

QObject::connect(this , SIGNAL(onaccept()), this, SLOT(finish()));

Is there a way to trigger a slot/ function in the panel after the filter 
has finished. ????

Thanks
Felipe

Hi Kevin,

How good is your network between the remote PC that execute pvserver and
your client computer that run paraview ?
How big is your data ?
What type of data is that ? Structured or unstructured ?
Did you try to run pvserver on that very same machine without using MPI ?
Does that change anything ?
Did you try to go in ParaView/Edit/Settings and compare "local rendering"
vs "remote rendering" performance ?

Py_ssize_t is a type defined by the python C API, but it looks like it
wasn't introduced until Python 2.5, so I'm guess that you have an
older version of python installed? What is the output of "python
--version"?

The matplotlib library requires python >= 2.6, so if your python is
older than this, you'll need to update your python installation, or
disable matplotlib in the ParaView build by editing
CMake/VTKModules.cmake and commenting out this section (around line
350):

# Enable vtkRenderingMatplotlib for math text rendering if python is available
if (PARAVIEW_ENABLE_PYTHON)
  list (APPEND _vtk_modules vtkRenderingMatplotlib)
endif()

I'll push a patch to only enable the matplotlib module when python is
an appropriate version.

Thanks for the report!

Dave

Subject: [Paraview] Reading DEM files
Message-ID: <20121204161654.D0F0BE6726@smtp.hushmail.com>

Hi,

I have SRTM DEM file and I tried to open it with Paraview 3.14 on Windows. When I click Apply in Properties pane it failed.
Then I see there is new Paraview version - 3.98. I downloaded it, and I opened same file. Now clicking Apply seems like program reads the file, and data type is stated as "Image: Uniform rectilinear grid", but without any data.

I use gdal and it shows file correctly. I can transform DEM to other format with gdal_translate, if some format is more acceptable by Paraview, but I'm not sure to which format should I transform DEM file.
Any suggestions?

Thanks

I'm replying on this thread, but my comments are really addressed to Pat.

Having made use of the memory inspector, I have memory leaks in my reader and wanted to track them down.
I tried to merge in the DebugLeaksView
http://public.kitware.com/Wiki/DebugLeaksView
helper which I thought would be nice to test. Using 3.98 I encountered conflicts and made a patch (though the conflicts I had might be caused by another tweak I made locally). Anyway, attached it a new patchset to get the debug leaks going in 3.98

For wiki page : I had to turn on VTK_DEBUG_LEAKS (fairly obvious) and manually enable vtkViewsQt module or something like that.

When compiling, lots of include paths were wrong so I just hard coded them and manually added vtkViewsQt.lib to the link line for paraview exe.

The debug leaks window is really fabulous. I spent an hour tweaking my code and reduced my ref counts and spare objects by a full factor of two. Now I have no leaks.

Feature request : Combine memory inspector and debug leaks into a single dock window. (Is it feasible to view debug leaks on remote nodes? - while running possibly, but not at closedown I suppose).

I may have a play with the QtDebugLeaks stuff if you aren't developing it any more to do the dock window combination changes.

Patches attached are not very useful as the VTK stuff isn't included and it would only take you 2 minutes to do it yourself anyway. Mostly just wanted to bump this thread in case someone was going to cleanly integrate the debugleaks in 3.98

Thanks very much for both these memory management controls, really saved me a lot of work.

JB

Thanks for putting it in the right place. This morning I've merged the new docs with the old in the user guide to clean it up a bit.

The inspector is great and I've been using it extensively to monitor some of the big jobs I've run recently. It really helps knowing how much memory you've actually used on each node - and more importantly, how close you are to getting a job killed.

Thanks for taking the time to contribute it.

The new panel reports per-process usage and provides some additional debugging tools. It should be available in the 3.98 release.

Hi guys,

I am trying to load a wavefront obj file into paraview and display it using
only python shell scripts.

I searched online and only find
http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK/Examples/Cxx/IO/ReadOBJ
This is vtk C++ code, and I am trying to convert them to python script. I
got stuck at trying to find the correct way to initiate a
vtkPolyDataMapper... I wonder if there is some similar example to load such
model using only python shell commands.

Many thanks in advance,

Li

The python code is much simpler in ParaView:

OpenDataFile('/path/to/data.obj')
Show()


For more commands, try:

help(paraview.simple)

You can also do: help(<any function or variable name>)

I was wrong about MPI_Finalize being invoked twice, I had miss read the

haven't been able to find anything in the debugger. This is new for 3.98.

Subject: [Paraview] "Select Cells On" etc.: Remove current selection from
 whole selection - possible?
Message-ID: <50BEF670.6010004@kunzelmann.de>

Hello to everybody,

my question today relates to the useful GUI tools "Select Points/Cells 
On/Trough". I already found out that I can extend an excisting selection 
with the Ctrl-key. But I could not find something to remove a small part 
from the selection with but keep most of the selected points/cells.

In other programs (ie. ImageJ/Fiji) they use the ALT key to remove the 
current selection from the total selection but keep the rest (usually 
the boolean combinations are supported). I would assume that this is 
could be already possible with Paraview as well and I just cannot find it.

If it is not supported. Would it be a big effort to implement this feature?

Sincerely

Karl-Heinz

Subject: [Paraview] Union of "Extract Selection" ( and modification with
 Calculator) with all data
Message-ID: <50BEF6F8.60105@kunzelmann.de>

Dear all,

I use the Paraview feature "Extract Selection" to edit data in a subset 
of my data set. Together with "Calculator" this is a very handy feature 
for me (I edit surface label which are used as identifier for boundary 
conditions in a FEA program).

At present I have to save the changes (I do it as csv) and use an 
external program to replace the labels in the whole/main dataset based 
on the index numbers with my changes. This is not very convenient. I am 
sure that this can be done with the Paraview pipeline browser somehow or 
with a few python commands in the console. However, with my current 
knowledge I cannot solve this problem along and could use some advice, 
how to accomplish this.

Thanks a lot.

Sincerely

Dear paraview users,

I have a question over the use of Annotate time filter in Paraview. I 
have a netcdf data which has time axis given as "days since 1950-01-01 
00:00". This gives problem if I want to show the real time of the data 
in the animation window. What I would like to have shown are the date as 
4-8-2003, 00:00 etc. But now it shows big number like 19521, 19522. 
Indeed they are days from 1-1-2950. Other visualization program like 
Ferret does show the right date.

Does anyone have some idea how to solve the problem?

Thanks a lot!

Subject: [Paraview]  Paraview 3.98.0 new behavior of Vislt Tecplot Reader
Message-ID: <50BF14D3.3060100@onera.fr>

Hello.

I have just tried the new PV 3.98.0 Linux release and found a new 
annoying behavior of the Vislt Tecplot Reader.

I read a pvsm state file built with PV 3.14.1 and all rendering fails!

With PV 3.14.1, I get one object in Surface mode colored by the pressure 
variable, and another object in Surface LIC mode using the friction 
vector and colored by the friction modulus variable.

But with PV 3.98.0, I get only solid color representation for the first 
object, and  solid color with points representation for the second 
object, with many errors in the message window. Looking at the 
information tab of the visible objects, the variables (pressure, 
friction vector, etc...) are not present !

My data files are Tecplot Files that should be read with the Vislt 
Tecplot reader. Looking at the reader property tab, I found two options 
in the "Meshes" frame: "mesh" and "points/mesh". The "points/mesh" 
option does not appear in PV 3.14.1. Both options are checked in PV 
3.98.0 when reading a state file built with PV 3.14.1. Unchecking this 
"points/mesh" option makes rendering OK.

I tried further tests with other Tecplot files in PV 3.98.0 without 
starting from a state file. I tried to open either a file that requires 
the classic Tecplot reader, or a file that requires the Vislt Tecplot 
reader:
- when the classic Tecplot Reader is required, all is OK.
- when the Vislt Tecplot reader is required, only the "points/mesh" 
option is checked by default, so it should be unchecked and the "mesh" 
option should be checked if I want a surface mode colored by a variable 
or a Surface LIC mode.

So, my question is : what is this new "points/mesh" option in the Vislt 
Tecplot reader, and why is it checked by default ?

Best regards.

Hi John,

Thanks for the patch!  Actually, funny you should send this email... I just
revived this this branch, 13024-debug-leaks-view, over the weekend.  I
encountered that same thing as you did, merge conflicts and an annoying
dependency on vtkViewsQt.

Unfortunately, the vtkQtDebugLeaksView got moved into vtkViewsQt during
modularization, even though it doesn't have a dependency on vtkViews.  I'll
submit a patch to vtk to move the class into vtkGUISupportQt where I think
it belongs, then I'll get 13024-debug-leaks-view merged into ParaView.

It's fine if you want to do work on moving dock panels around, I don't have
any new development on the class planned.

> Is it feasible to view debug leaks on remote nodes?

It would be feasible, and could be quite useful!  Might not be the most
straightforward to implement, though.  Also, I'm not sure to what extent
you use the python console in ParaView for debugging, but it's always been
a dream of mine to add a feature that allows the python console to inspect
remote objects on server nodes.

You can use the Python Annotation Filter and make the proper Python
processing code to present the time information the way you want.

Hello Seb,

Thanks a  lot for your reply. I just looked I didn't see something like 
"Python Annotation" in the "filters" What I have is only "Annotate time 
filter". The question is how can I get this filter? I'm running 
Paraview3.14.0 32bits. Is this a good version?
Or I need to do some extra...?

Cheers!
Xueli

Oops, that's probably only on 3.98 which you can download from the ParaView
website if you don't want to build it.

Hi Li,

There is a wiki page on Python_Scripting in Paraview

http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView#Python_Scripting

You may find the "Trace" UI tool in paraview very useful to get
yourself started.

hi everybody,

I'm using the great plugin ;) ParaViewSocketPlugin, to control ParaView. 
But now I will like to have some information sent back to the client.  I 
look at the sources but I couldn't figure out the way to do it.

Is this possible, using the plugin (or some minor modifications) ???

Subject: [Paraview] "Select Cells On" etc.: Remove current selection
 from whole selection - possible?

Hi Carl-Heinz,

This feature is not supported in Paraview currently. You can add a
feature request on ParaView User Voice
(http://paraview.uservoice.com).

The main issue here is that paraview supports many types of
selections, and it will take some efforts to make this work across all
selection types.

With that said, the closest thing I can think of that could give what
you want with lots of pain is the Spreadsheet view. In that view, you
can un-select a subset of a selection if you know what you want to
unselect.

HTH,
Yumin

Hi Felipe,

If you customized panel is derived from pqProxyPanel, you can either
override the accept() method, or do a connection like this:

  QObject::connect(this->propertyManager(), SIGNAL(accepted()), this,
SLOT(finish()));

I can't see any suitable stuff there: only scaling button and ability to change

Hi, Christian,

   The old ParticlePathLine filter is replaced by ParticlePath filter.
 Unlike the old one, you do not have to attach it to a particle tracer.
 Also make sure you set the "TerminationTime" parameter to the largest
possible time.

   I have written an article about this work: .
http://www.kitware.com/source/home/post/76

   Let me know if this works for you.

thanks,

The vtkTemporalPathLineFilter does not need to be attached to a stream tracer at all. It was developed for use with any particle dataset, (I just happened to use it with the temporal stream tracer as well and put that in the docs as an example). It is a general purpose filter for joining points up as time evolves and also allows you to provide a selection of points to use to subset the trails produced. The ParticlePath filter does work for this kind of data.
It's true that the Trails filter did not support particles jumping between processes in parallel, but why you would remove this filter is beyond me. Can the support for particles across process boundaries be added to the Trails filter?

I just tried the vtkTemporalPathLineFilter in 3.98 and some of the options seem to have disappeared. I will have to get it working again and submit a patch.

Erratum

. The ParticlePath filter does NOT work for this kind of data.

The absence of the word NOT being quite important in the context!

Hi,

For the old version of ParaView (3.14)  the command I used to build a 
Superbuild version was:

cmake -D <options ...>  /path/to/ParaView/SuperBuild/

(/path/to/ParaView is my git Paraview repository )

But now I cloned the new superbuild with

git clone git://paraview.org/ParaViewSuperbuild.git

to /path/to/ParaViewSuperbuild

But now I don't  know how to configure my paraview superbuild.

cmake -D ???   /path/to/ParaViewSuperbuild

or do I have to put the ParaViewSuperbuild repository inside the 
ParaView one??

Thanks
Felipe

Yes, you can send information back through the socket.  If you're using the
socket to invoke python code, then any string returned by your python code
will be written to the socket.  But, by default the python handler method
doesn't return anything.  If you edit pqPythonSocketHandler.cxx, you can
change the python handler function that is used.  Just put some code like
this at the top of onSocketReadReady():

  PyObject* mainModule = PyImport_AddModule("__main__");
  PyObject* mainDict = PyModule_GetDict(mainModule);
  this->Internal->Callback = PyDict_GetItemString(mainDict, "myFunction");

That will make the socket forward the string to a python function you've
implemented called "myFunction()", and any string returned by that will be
written to the socket.

Hi Felipe,

from our superbuild on the CDash you can get how ours are setup. Basically
here is the set of options defined for one of them:

set (dashboard_cache "

ENABLE_acusolve:BOOL=ON
ENABLE_boost:BOOL=ON
ENABLE_cgns:BOOL=ON
ENABLE_cosmologytools:BOOL=ON
ENABLE_ffmpeg:BOOL=ON
ENABLE_manta:BOOL=ON
ENABLE_matplotlib:BOOL=ON
ENABLE_mpi:BOOL=ON
ENABLE_numpy:BOOL=ON
ENABLE_paraview:BOOL=ON
ENABLE_python:BOOL=ON
ENABLE_qt:BOOL=ON
ENABLE_silo:BOOL=ON
ENABLE_visitbridge:BOOL=ON
ENABLE_vistrails:BOOL=ON

#Location where source tar-balls are (to be) downloaded.
download_location:PATH=${CTEST_DASHBOARD_ROOT}/ParaViewSuperbuild-downloads
")


But you can get the full setup here
http://open.cdash.org/viewNotes.php?buildid=2699820

Or by switching to Advanced on CDash and clicking on the little "Note"
icone next to the superbuild that you are interested in.

Seb

Hi,

Thank you for your help. But, i dont know how i can build ParaView/pvpython
with OsMesa on a Windows machine (all tutorials that i found are for linux
machines).
Can you explain to me how i can do this?

Thank you again!

Hicham

Hi,

I don't even know if OSMesa can be built on windows.

Sorry,

Hi, Christian,
   We can the filter back (probably under a different name).  Do you mind

Is there another way to remove the openGL windows other than build
ParaView/pvpython with OsMesa ?

Okay, I've done a little more work on this and the following is what I have
so far:

import math


 r = inputs[0].PointData['d']/2

SurfArea = math.pi*r*r


 z = inputs[0].Points[:,2]

h = 0.00015 - abs(z - 0.00015) - r

H0 = h/r


 numPoints = inputs[0].GetNumberOfPoints()

SurfCvg = 0

for i in range(numPoints):

  if H0[i] < 0.002:

    SurfCvg = SurfCvg + SurfArea[i]


 Theta = SurfCvg/(0.010*0.001*2)


 output.RowData.append(Theta, 'Theta')


The output is set to vtkTable.  When I try running this, though, I get the
following error message repeated three times:


ERROR: In ..\..\..\..\src\VTK\Filtering\vtkDemandDrivenPipeline.cxx, line
827

vtkPVDataRepresentationPipeline (000000001444A130): Input for connection
index 0 on input port index 0 for algorithm
vtkGeometryRepresentation(000000001279BFE0) is of type vtkTable, but a
vtkDataSet is required.


Do I need to manually define my SurfCvg and SurfArea variables as vtkTable
types?  I'm just a bit lost at this point, but feeling closer.

Hi Leo,

I attached you the simplest testcase I can made, one STL and one vtk 
containing only one particle.
At the image you see the expected output as it was in 3.14.1.

Thanks for fixis this,
Christian

Message-ID: <50C173C2.9080708@tridiagonal.co.in>

If I know a how to do a certain thing in Paraview GUI, how do I find the 
corresponding pvpython commands ?
Is there a way of obtaining the pvpython commands for the actions 
performed in paraview GUI ?

Subject: [Paraview] I cannot get fortran ensight gold files to work
Message-ID: <262C3FD6-27B1-43D6-93DF-F263DE289CA3@uvm.edu>

Hi all, 

I'm trying to get, at this point, just a single vector file to plot in paraview.  I'm creating ensight gold files in fortran compiled with the new GCC compiler set (i've tried older ones as well) on OS X 10.6.  My case files will load, the variables will show up but there's not information in them.  I can also see my grid.  I'm attempting to use, what i think, is a fairly common fortran program to make case and ensight gold field files.  I have some C subroutines that do this fine, but i'd like to have a Fortran version but no matter what i do nothing seems to work, what am i missing? 

Any help, or a better way of doing this in fortran, would be much appreciated.

Thanks, and hit me up if you need any other information.

Message-ID: <926B17FF29644A4F922FE08604CA92F61CD3FE60@UOS-MSG00041-SI.soton.ac.uk>

Hello,

I am trying to extract the surface pressure data from a large CFD dataset using pvbatch. I have been using the following script but it only outputs a single file. The filename looks like this: test.0.00000_n.Cp so it seems the writer is capable to output multiple timesteps. Does anyone have an idea how to change the script to output the full time series ?

Thanks,

Koen

Ryan,

The first thing I see is that your character writes need to 80 
characters, that is, something like using buffer(1:80) and

buffer = 'part'
write(FileUnit,'(A)') buffer

I have not looked further at your coding. However, I have attached the 
Fortran-90/95 routines that I routinely use to write EnSight 
binary-formatted files.

Subject: [Paraview] PointSprites don't appear from Mac OS X pvserver
Message-ID: <A6DC7945B8B27848A60E229D7E2951E91CF7256F@ECS-EXG-P-MB03.win.lanl.gov>

I've been using both 3.14.1 and 3.98.0 with the following behavior on Mac OS 10.6.8:

Paraview in Mac-client-only mode (locally) displays Point and PointSprite data just fine.

Paraview in Mac-client+Unix-server mode displays Point data, but not PointSprite data (the PointSprites are invisible).

Paraview in Unix-client displayed via X11 on the Mac displays Point data, but not PointSprite data (invisible).

Paraview in Unix-client displayed via X11 on a Unix box displays both Point and PointSprite just fine.

Paraview in Unix-client+Unix-server mode displayed on a Unix box displays both Point and PointSprite just fine.

It appears that remote PointSprites are invisible on Mac OSX, only local ones seem to show up on the display.

Any ideas?

Thanks much.

Hi Kyle et al.

below are stack traces where PV is hung. I'm stumped by this, and can 
get no foothold. I still have one chance if we can get valgrind to run 
with MPI on nautilus. But it's a long shot, valgrinding pvbatch on my 
local system throws many hundreds of errors. I'm not sure which of these 
are valid reports.

PV 3.14.1 doesn't hang in pvbatch, so I wondering if anyone knows of a 
change in 3.98 that may account for the new hang?

Hi Ryan,

If you set "C Binary" in EnSight Gold header, you must open the file
in Fortran code with form='BINARY' instead of form='UNFORMATTED'. I
think the problem is whether there are BYTE COUNT or not.

That's great!  Thanks for sharing.  What are we seeing in the video, you're
doing some displacement of the mesh?

By the way there is a new plugin that was just added to ParaView, it's
called MobileRemoteControl.  It's not general purpose like the
ParaViewSocketPlugin, it has no python scripting, but it uses a similar
socket design.  It uses the ParaViewWeb protocol (provided by the
vtkWebGLExporter library) to send the ParaView scene geometry to a mobile
device, and receives camera state information back from the device.  It
runs on Android and iOS, but so far I've only developed a UI for iOS. It's
still work in progress, but there is some information here-

The pipeline is just my home made reader, and a Warp filter.

My reader is for a solution written in separated representation (I  
call it PXDMF).
(http://rom.research-centrale-nantes.com/resources/separated-variables-representation-visualisation/ 
)

  In other words, in  a classic solution you have u(x,y,z,t), or one  
u(x,y,z) for every (t).
So you have the space and a extra temporal dimension.

In my case the solution is u(x,y,z,Fx,Fy,T,x,Ty,Dx). The space 3D  
(x,y,z ), force position 2D (Fx,Fy), force direction 2D (Tx,Ty) and  
tumor density (Dx).

In the tablet I retrieve all the info about my reader (thanks to you)  
and a actualised the solution in real time.
So a have a real-time "simulation" of a liver under a force in the  
surface.

The final use of this (the tablet app) is that in our lab we have a 3D  
room, and we will like to give to some one in the public the capacity  
to control some aspect of the visualisation (point of view, parametric  
dimension...)

An another example of my reader plugin (without the tablet) can be  
found at (http://rom.research-centrale-nantes.com/overview/#parametricmaterial 
)

Enjoy,  Felipe

       The rendering result was wrong, Is this a bug of ParaView? 
      Thanks for your helps.

I pushed a vtk topic branch to gerrit.  The topic moves the debug leaks
from from ViewsQt to GUISupportQt.

http://review.source.kitware.com/#/t/1829/

I updated the 13024-debug-leaks-view branch on paraview stage.  When the
vtk topic goes from gerrit to master, then this branch can be added to
paraview.

Hi Burlen,

Thanks for getting these. I'll take a closer look today and see what I can find.

Hello everyone,

I am using Paraview to evaluate mesh quality (scaled Jacobian measurement) and want to know, how many elements have a larger quality measurement than, e.g., 0.8, 0.6, 0.4 and 0.2. Is there an easy way to extract this information? Thank you very much!

Best wishes,

Should be fairly easy by using the threshold filter. Apply the threshold
filter to extract the cells with the value you want, then look at the
information tab to get the number of cells.

or you can use the histogram filter...

You could run the histogram filter on the dataset but that won't leave you with complete control over the bin cutoffs for quality values. It's probably what you want, though.

You can also create a Threshold filter for each quality (0.8, 0.6, 0.4, 0.2) of interest and look at the information tabs for a report of the number of cells. That is awkward but you get to pick exactly the quality values of interest, even if they are non-uniform.

You can also use the Find Data dialog to find cells that exactly match a
single value or range without having to create new geometry with the
threshold filter.

You could use the Find Data dialog box (under the edit menu).  Query for
the Quality criteria you are interested in (e.g. Quality is >= 0.8), click
the Run selection Query, then scroll down to the bottom of the Query
Results box.  The rows are numbered, so the last row number is the count
minus 1.

Of course, if what you really want to know is the distribution of quality,
then the histogram is a better choice.

Subject: [Paraview] Limit Slice to a non-infinite area
Message-ID: <4829488.nSPkbuLBMC@horus>

Hello,

can I make a slice using a non-infinite plane? Usually a slice always spans the 
entire domain. Can I limit the area of a slice? e.g. if I want to use the 
integrate variables filter to integrate only on a part of the domain.

Thanks,

Florian

Scott,
The following code will create a field variable:

output.ShallowCopy(inputs[0].VTKObject)  # Include this if you haven't 
already
value = vtk.vtkFloatArray()
value.SetName('varname')
value.SetNumberOfComponents(1)
value.InsertNextValue(42)
output.GetFieldData().AddArray(value)

Obviously, you'll want to set 'varname' to a meaningful variable name 
and "42" to some usable value (e.g., Theta).

Now, I would have thought that the Plot Global Variables Over Time 
filter would do the trick, but it appears (if I'm reading the 
documentation correctly), that the field data actually needs to be an 
array with the same number of elements as there are time steps.  You'd 
have to tweak the code above to do this, and I guess, play through all 
the time steps to construct it.

Unless someone has another idea?

Hi,

I would be interested in learning more about mesh quality evaluation, and would appreciate a pointer to some literature or other information sources.
Which formats can be used to load the mesh into ParaView?

Thanks,

Matthias

Thanks but I don't get it,

before (3.14) was very easy to generate a superbuld, just:

cmake  /path/to/ParaViewgitsources/SuperBuild/

But now, after I downloaded the paraview sources and the surperbuild 
sources from git, What is the command line to configure my project (with 
cmake).

Do I really have to generate all the extra files like on CDash. And then 
how do I tell cmake were are my sources????

Hi,

ParaViewSuperbuild will check out the paraview source code itself.

To use the new superbuild create a build directory and specify the
ParaViewSuperbuild as the source directory. If you want to use the
superbuild
to build a custom version of the paraview source, you will need to edit
versions.txt in the root directory of the superbuild project.

Hi Matthias,

> I would be interested in learning more about mesh quality evaluation, and would appreciate a pointer to some literature or other information sources.

This wiki page http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK/mesh_quality has a link to user documentation for the quality library VTK uses (named Verdict). The documentation has references to papers on the different quality measures.

> Which formats can be used to load the mesh into ParaView?

The File->Open dialog has a pull-down list at the bottom describing the different file formats ParaView supports.

Message-ID: <SNT123-W39908B94ED5B4791777D9FF7480@phx.gbl>




Hey,


I am looking for a way to save the list of 3D coordinates of a point selection made in the GUI. This could for example be to a CSV file, but the file format is not critical. Even a copy-and-paste of a Python list from the console would be fine. 


The spreadsheet view only allows me to copy one row at a time. All of the Python code I could find on the web was standalone, i.e. without an interface to what is going on in the GUI.


Much obliged for any pointers!

I have a reader that gives me a MultiBlock Data set. I use the "Extract MultiBlock" to pull out 3 blocks: Phi1, Phi, Phi2. These values are in Degrees and I need to convert them to radians. I figured I would use the Calculator to simply multiply every value by .017 to get the radian values. Um. Not having a lot of luck getting the calculator to work. I am getting the following:

Nope. The next filter depends on the multiblock dataset being there.

Subject: [Paraview] How to Rename Blocks in Exodus File
Message-ID: <50C7F34C.5060707@neo.rr.com>

Hello, newby to both Paraview and Python here, so be gentle.

I would like to rename the Exodus blocks to useful names, in a macro 
script, reading the names from a file.

As sexy as
"Unnamed Block ID: 1 Type: Hex"  is,

I'd much rather have:
"Tread ID: 1 Type: Hex" or something else in the problem domain for the 
benefit of the user

so using src=ExodusIIReader

I can use SetData on src.ElementBlocks and change that - which 
accomplishes nothing except de-activating all my blocks

However,  I need to change src.ElementBlocks.Available and I can't 
figure out how to do that as there is no SetData and nothing else I 
tried works

Thanks for any help.

Dennis

Hi Dennis,

> I would like to rename the Exodus blocks to useful names, in a macro script, reading the names from a file. ...

Before doing this in ParaView, does it make sense to change the Exodus file instead? That way the names would stay changed across ParaView sessions and any other applications that use the file will have access to them. You should be able to use netcdf4-python ( http://code.google.com/p/netcdf4-python/ ) to get/set the element block names (since Exodus files are just netCDF files that follow a particular naming convention). If the "eb_names" variable exists in the netCDF file, you can alter it. Otherwise, you can add it and save the file. See the VTKData repository ( http://vtk.org/VTKData.git ) for an example file (edgeFaceElem.exii) that has names in it. The ncdump and ncgen programs that come with NetCDF are also useful for editing small files; I would advise using them to examine and modify edgeFaceElem.exii before writing a Python script to change things.

> so using src=ExodusIIReader I can use SetData on src.ElementBlocks and change that - which accomplishes nothing except de-activating all my blocks

I'm not sure how "src=ExodusIIReader; src.ElementBlocks" works at all. Are you using Tools->Python Shell to run Python commands? Or a Programmable Filter?

> However,  I need to change src.ElementBlocks.Available and I can't figure out how to do that as there is no SetData and nothing else I tried works


Given my confusion above, I cannot be sure, but it looks like you are trying to modify the reader and not the data that it loads. But the reader in ParaView is part of a pipeline that creates the dataset and modifies it as the user requests changes (e.g., load variable "A", turn off block "B", and so on), so even if you were to modify the reader's output data, it would not stay changed.

If you want the names to be different in filters that connect to the reader, you'll have to create an intermediate Programmable Filter that runs a Python script to change block names. See http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Python_Programmable_Filter for more information, but be aware that you'll need some knowledge of how VTK multiblock datasets are named to make this work.

Hi Florian,


'Extract Selection' or 'Extract Cells by Region' filter may help you.
Apply them to your Sliced sources.

Does all your block share the same array names ?

The Blocks have names of "Phi1", "Phi", "Phi2". If I have to use 3 calculators that is fine by me at this point.

Hi Thomas,

thank you for your answer. I have managed to import a test mesh into Paraview and display its quality. Next I will study the information sources you and David gave me and try to understand what the "Quality" value means - I get values mostly near zero, going up to 14 for some cells.

Thanks,

Matthias

Betreff: Mesh quality

Hello,

there are some good papers by Knupp, who was involved in developing Cubit, and also others especially in the context of mesh quality improvement. In general it is pretty easy to asses mesh quality in Paraview. You just have to load the elements via a vtk file (just google for it and you will find a manual, it's basically self explaining) and use the the Filter Mesh Quality. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me!

Knupp 2000, Achieving finite element mesh quality via optimization of the Jacobian matrix norm and associated quantities. (There is a Part I and Part II paper)

Field 2000, Qualitative measures for initial meshes.

Best wishes,

Hi Sebastien,

There is a normal ethernet cable with 1 GB/s between server and computer.
The same data was created with different number of processes, for example 4 times 330 megabyte or 8 times 165 megabyte, so that the data as a whole is 1320 megabyte big and it is an unstructered data.
Well I had not the time to test it again, but I will do.

But what I haven?t understand is the fact that when I load this data and want to change the filter from outline to wireframe or surface than my Paraview crashed after one minute or so. When I load a single part of the data (with 165MB or 330MB) I could change the filter but it needs very long to do that.
When I first use isosurfaces on the data than I have no problem to view the data or to move it around. Where could be the problem?

Kevin

Hi Kevin, 

How good is your network between the remote PC that execute pvserver and your client computer that run paraview ?
How big is your data ?
What type of data is that ? Structured or unstructured ?
Did you try to run pvserver on that very same machine without using MPI ? Does that change anything ?
Did you try to go in ParaView/Edit/Settings and compare "local rendering" vs "remote rendering" performance ?

  Well I try to use Paraview on parallel, but I think it doesn?t work right how I do it.
  I use a remote PC on which I will run the Paraview client and a extern server with up to 48 CPUs and good GPUs.
  So I start the server using ?mpirun ?np ?number? ../pvserver? or ?mpirun ?np ?number? ../pvserver ?display localhost:0? (my Paraview is compiled with openmpi on a linux system). Then I connect over the remote PC in Paraview to this server (client/server mode).
  It works, but not well. I?ve got test data (about 1GB) and it takes about two minutes to change for example the filter from outline to wireframe. Also when I want to move the image with drag and drop it takes about five seconds to rerender it. I think for only 1GB it takes too long for doing this.
  Also I?m not sure if my server uses its GPUs or only its CPUs, I don?t know how to find it out. 
  Would it be better to use my remote PC only as a display?
  Could you tell me how Paraview scales with  the number of data sets and number of processes. Should I use ?x? processes to load ?x? data sets? Or is it better to use more processes than data sets (for example: Would it be better to use 8 processes for loading 6 data sets than using 6 processes?)
  Is there another way how I could start my server that it will work better? Or what can I change that it will work better?

  I hope you can help me a little bit and give me tips how I should use Paraview on parallel. Thanks.


  Greetings,

  Kevin

I'm talking about the data array, across all block not the name of the
blocks.
But if you are saying that depending on the block you have to convert
either Phi1, Phi or Phi2 data arrays, then I start seeing why the
calculator complain.
But for now, you can use 3 extract blocks, 3 calculator and one append
dataset filter.

Hi Kevin,

What reader are you using to read your data ?
Moreover, do you have a descent graphic card with the correct driver
installed ? On Linux, this is more than important to take the latest NVidia
driver and don't use the system package version.

Seb

Hi,

Note sure if this has been reported but I just tried
ParaView-3.98.0-Windows-64bit from the downloads page and it crashes when I
switch to volume rendering on a raw file. The same parameters work ok on
3.14.

I can provide sample data if this is new.

Cheers,

Paul

Subject: [Paraview] Problems with installing pvpython
Message-ID: <loom.20121213T094302-841@post.gmane.org>

Hello,

I just installed Paraview 3.98 on my Mac OS x 10.8. The paraview.app has
 been installed in "/Applications"  folder and the "__init.py__" files are in 
the "/Applications/paraview.app/Contents/Python/paraview" folder.  When 
I do "ls" in this folder, I get:

==============================
#v#			pvfilters.py
__init__.py		pvfilters.pyc
__init__.pyc		pvvtkextensions.py
annotation.py		pvvtkextensions.pyc
annotation.pyc		servermanager.py
benchmark.py		servermanager.pyc
benchmark.pyc		simple.py
collaboration.py	simple.pyc
collaboration.pyc	smstate.py
compile_all_pv.py	smstate.pyc
compile_all_pv.pyc	smtrace.py
demos/			smtrace.pyc
extract_selection.py	util.py
extract_selection.pyc	util.pyc
numeric.py		variant.py
numeric.pyc		variant.pyc
numpy_support.py	vtk/
numpy_support.pyc	vtkConstants.py
pv_compile_complete	vtkConstants.pyc
============================

I also added the address to this folder to my pythonpath. I don't know 
what else to do to get "pvpthon"  working. Right now when I try to import 
"simple" or "servermanager" in the python environment, I get the 
following error: "ImportError: No module named paraview". 

Any ideas what can I do? 
Thanks

Message-ID: <867EF7E0-7CAF-41E7-878B-07E15007A400@ibt.uni-karlsruhe.de>

Hi,

is there a way to add a 2D image to an existing 3D visualization with the image being shown frontally independent of the current camera settings?

If I use the PNGSeriesReader(), the image slice is rotated according to the camera settings, thus not shown frontally. Basically, I am looking for something similar to a Text Source for images (or a series of images to be precise).

Any suggestions are appreciated.

Axel

Dear all,
I am using Paraview 3.98 on Mountain Lion. I would like to export an
animation. The only format available now are ogv, or png/jpeg snapshots. Is
there a way to export to avi? I know I can create an avi from a bunch of
png/jpeg files, just would like to know if Paraview has the ability built
in.
Thanks in advance.

I am using the linux 64-bit binary and I do "save animation" and avi is 
one of the options.

ParaView should be able to produce avi's on Mac, as long as it was
compiled with ffmpeg.
Did you build ParaView yourself or use the kitware binary distribution?

Hi Pradeep,

did you tried to do that ?

$ cd /Applications/paraview.app/Contents/bin
$ ./pvpython
>>> from paraview.simple import *
>>> Cone()
>>> Show()
>>> Render()

Do you manage to see the cone in a 3D window ?

Seb

Hi Paul could you file a bug ?
And check if you can reproduce the crash with the Wavelet source.

Thanks,

Looks like a regression in 3.98.

Subject: [Paraview] Group scalar over time
Message-ID: <CAMGVExhSjMao2+Wj41QXLcmTxFXEJ8Bbo1oG4kA3zpQRxYY9zg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all. In a single file, I have the same scalar over time (say they're
named a0, a1,...,a19 for 20 time steps).
Is there any way to group these together so that I can animate over time
after I read in the file? I would prefer not to parse the scalars into
multiple files.
Cheers,
Nick

I have reported the bug, http://paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=13734 .
(At Mantis, I was not able to select 3.98 as version to report.
Furhtermore, I choose TBD as project, but I was unsure about it.)
Thanks for digging into the issue.

Subject: [Paraview] Animation AND Coprocessing - the right file format,
	vtk or xdmf?
Message-ID: <17142532.531355487808251.JavaMail.root@piola.mechanik.tu-darmstadt.de>

Dear Paraview users,

we are planing to use Paraview for our calculations and i've done some research on the availible file formats. But there are some points I do not understand or i can't find any Informations on it. I hope one of you had similar questions and might help me now.

There are several things we want to do and i'am not sure which file format is the right one for us:

1. We want to animate our results, meaning we have datas for every time step and want to make an animation out of this.

Problem: Vtk File format can do this, but as I see it, you need an extra file for every time step.As If we are having about >10000 timesteps this is getting a bit cumbersome. Is that right or is there a way to put all the datas in one file? 
As an alternativ there is the xdmf file format, there i already figuered out a way to put all the time step datas in one file. But the Problem is:

2. We want to use the facility of Coprocessing, meaning we want to see our results just in time during the simulation.

Problem: As I understood the ParaView User Guide this is only possible with the vtk File Format or is there an "easy" way to realise this with the xdmf Format?

Last but not least we want to use existing libarys to write our datas with C or C++.

Regards,
Claudio

Subject: [Paraview] Problems with rendering/interacting with a large-ish
 volume data set...
Message-ID: <50CB9998.2070502@sfu.ca>

Hello all,

I was wondering if someone could provide me with some advice. I am 
trying to work with a large-ish (not really that large) volume data set. 
It is a 698x69x665 unsigned byte data set (~320MB).

When working with Paraview (3.98.0-RC1) operations on the data set are 
quite cumbersome and relatively simple operations cause all sorts of 
havoc. I am wondering if there is something odd with my set up or are my 
expectations of interacting with a largeish volume data set too high. 
The specs for my workstation are:

Windows 7 Pro, 64 bit, 2 X5690 processors (12 cores) at 3.47 GHz, 24 GB 
of memory, nVidia Quadro 6000 graphics card. Pretty loaded...

Rendering the data set with surface or volume is relatively interactive. 
When I try to apply other common filters (clip, threshold, isosurface) 
strange things occur:

1) Applying a Clip filter causes Paraview to eventually consume 100% of 
the memory on my machine (24 GB). The computation of the filter runs 
forever, and I essentially have to kill off Paraview (the filter 
application doesn't complete after waiting several minutes).

2) Applying a Threshold filter causes the same to occur. Basically 
causes memory usage to climb to 100% (24 GB). The filter never completes 
(at least not before my patience runs out 8-)

3) Applying a Contour threshold works but strange things happen after 
isosurface creation. It creates a large polygon mesh (9M cells). With 
that said, memory footprint is still quite small. When interacting it 
renders using LOD so it is interactive. When I stop interacting it takes 
a couple of seconds to render at full resolution and another two seconds 
or so after it reaches full resolution LOD before I can interact with 
the application again. Approximately 4 seconds between stopping one 
interaction with the visualization (e.g. rotating the model) and being 
able to interact with the application again. Performance/interaction 
wise that is OK. The main problem is that only half the data set is 
rendered (see the image attached) at full LOD. There is no clip plane in 
the pipeline and yet half the data is missing in the display. The image 
should be a full sphere. When rendered at the lower LOD the entire data 
set is displayed, when rendered at full LOD the data is not.

The above does not seem normal. The data set is large, but not huge. I 
certainly wouldn't expect the memory usage to spike to 24 GB and the 
rendering with the isosurface is very odd.

Any advice from more experienced Paraview users? Should I get better 
performance/results? I would have thought so, are my expectations our to 
lunch? Or is this a bug that I should report?

Brian

This definitely seems to be a set of bugs.
Can you share your data privately with us ? So we can track that down ?

Thanks,

Group,
I need to repackage my Windows installs, adding a few extra files to the  install.  I use to do this through the CMakeLists.txt file found in the Applications/ParaView source directory, inserting the lines:

 INSTALL(FILES fileName
  DESTINATION ${PV_INSTALL_BIN_DIR}
  PERMISSIONS OWNER_WRITE OWNER_READ OWNER_EXECUTE GROUP_READ GROUP_EXECUTE WORLD_READ
  COMPONENT Runtime)

How should this be done now?  What CMakeLists.txt file should I edit?

Thanks,

Hi Seb,

I have asked the researcher, but in the mean time one can create the 
problem by simply generating a file of dimension 698x693x665 (Zeros.raw) 
with all Zeros in it. It seems to be independent of what is in the data 
file...

I load it with the "Raw (binary) Files" reader setting the dimensions as 
appropriate and scalar type to unsigned char. I then apply the Threshold 
filter as in the attached image and voila, I get the memory usage 
pattern from the second image.

I can give you the Zeros file, but it is probably faster to generate it 
than download. Let me know if you want the file... 8-)

The first two problems that Brian reports come as no surprise to me and do not sound like bugs.  When you run either the clip filter or the threshold filter, an unstructured grid is generated by necessity.  An unstructured grid is a much less efficient representation than the image data you get from a raw file.  I would expect an unstructured grid representation of a 698x693x665 grid to take about 20 GB, so you can pretty much expect to run out of memory.

When dealing with large data like this, you should prefer slice over clip and contour over threshold.  These latter filters tend to generate much smaller and more manageable outputs.  The most recent ParaView User's Guide contains more details on these issues under the Modifying Data chapter.

http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/UsersGuide/Recommendations

Now the final problem, where only half of the contour is rendered, sounds very strange and may well be a bug.  However, I don't think Sebastien will be able to replicate it with the zeros dataset (which will have no interesting contours).

Hi Seb,

I have asked the researcher, but in the mean time one can create the problem by simply generating a file of dimension 698x693x665 (Zeros.raw) with all Zeros in it. It seems to be independent of what is in the data file...

I load it with the "Raw (binary) Files" reader setting the dimensions as appropriate and scalar type to unsigned char. I then apply the Threshold filter as in the attached image and voila, I get the memory usage pattern from the second image.

I can give you the Zeros file, but it is probably faster to generate it than download. Let me know if you want the file... 8-)

    Hello all,

    I was wondering if someone could provide me with some advice. I am
    trying to work with a large-ish (not really that large) volume data
    set. It is a 698x69x665 unsigned byte data set (~320MB).

    When working with Paraview (3.98.0-RC1) operations on the data set
    are quite cumbersome and relatively simple operations cause all
    sorts of havoc. I am wondering if there is something odd with my set
    up or are my expectations of interacting with a largeish volume data
    set too high. The specs for my workstation are:

    Windows 7 Pro, 64 bit, 2 X5690 processors (12 cores) at 3.47 GHz, 24
    GB of memory, nVidia Quadro 6000 graphics card. Pretty loaded...

    Rendering the data set with surface or volume is relatively
    interactive. When I try to apply other common filters (clip,
    threshold, isosurface) strange things occur:

    1) Applying a Clip filter causes Paraview to eventually consume 100%
    of the memory on my machine (24 GB). The computation of the filter
    runs forever, and I essentially have to kill off Paraview (the
    filter application doesn't complete after waiting several minutes).

    2) Applying a Threshold filter causes the same to occur. Basically
    causes memory usage to climb to 100% (24 GB). The filter never
    completes (at least not before my patience runs out 8-)

    3) Applying a Contour threshold works but strange things happen
    after isosurface creation. It creates a large polygon mesh (9M
    cells). With that said, memory footprint is still quite small. When
    interacting it renders using LOD so it is interactive. When I stop
    interacting it takes a couple of seconds to render at full
    resolution and another two seconds or so after it reaches full
    resolution LOD before I can interact with the application again.
    Approximately 4 seconds between stopping one interaction with the
    visualization (e.g. rotating the model) and being able to interact
    with the application again. Performance/interaction wise that is OK.
    The main problem is that only half the data set is rendered (see the
    image attached) at full LOD. There is no clip plane in the pipeline
    and yet half the data is missing in the display. The image should be
    a full sphere. When rendered at the lower LOD the entire data set is
    displayed, when rendered at full LOD the data is not.

    The above does not seem normal. The data set is large, but not huge.
    I certainly wouldn't expect the memory usage to spike to 24 GB and
    the rendering with the isosurface is very odd.

    Any advice from more experienced Paraview users? Should I get better
    performance/results? I would have thought so, are my expectations
    our to lunch? Or is this a bug that I should report?

Subject: [Paraview] Overlay image over sphere
Message-ID: <20121216133809.7FFF214DBDE@smtp.hushmail.com>

Hi,

I'm new Paraview user, so many things may not be obvious. Hope this question is easy and useful to ask.

I have roughly sphere or more correctly spheroid as Earth approximation, created with WGS (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WGS-84#Main_parameters) suggested radii. It consists of "theta resolution": 360, and "phi resolution": 180, mimicking lat/lon coordinates.
I also have GeoTiff raster which I want to overlay on my ellipsoid. Raster is in WGS-84 geographic coordinate system

Can someone give some pointers how to overlay raster on sphere?

Thanks

You need to add your raster as texture to the sphere. In the property panel
(Turn on the advanced option), you should find an option to add a texture
to your sphere.

Thanks Sebastien,

Your tip helped me find that I have to add filter to make texture possible, and then it covers whole sphere 2 times - once each hemisphere. I'll try harder and perhaps discover if I can add texture just on specific part (tile) of the sphere.

If you don't mind asking again, can you tell me if it's possible to overlay heighfield over sphere instead 2D image?
I didn't find how to make Paraview read TIFF as heighfield, but I can easily convert TIFF to NetCDF or HDF5 which Paraview loads in 3D

For reference, this can be avoided by unticking "Prevent Seam" texture map property

I have some time now, so I addressed the issue. I don't the code has a
problem; the problem is related to the .wind file.

Near the bottom, it describes how many fields exist in the comp.out files
("DATA_VARIABLES"). For your test data, each file is about 64.5 MB. The
.wind says that each file should have 23 fields. For n scalar fields, 1 is
reserved for UVW; (n-1) for scalar data. So for this one, 1 for UWV while
22 for scalar data.

The UVW block is about 10 MB (160x80x70x(4 bytes)x(3 components)); each
scalar field is about 3.6 MB (160x80x70x(4 bytes)).  So 10 MB + 22 scalar
fields*3.6 gives you about 90 MB.  That's way too big compared to the
actual sizes of the comp.out files that you guys have for testing. * The
test works when you reduce the "DATA_VARIABLES" item from 23 to 16* (which
will give you close to 64.5 MB).

I'm not sure why this .wind file is bad. Maybe older wind blade readers
just ignored errors like these.  Anyway, the test seems to launch a window
and close right away. I didn't see any other errors after I fixed the wind
file that I am using.

A couple of questions:
1. How do you organize the VTK build directory with the testdata? The VTK
tests seem to expect the data to be four directories UP the hierarchy, so I
had to place my vtkData directory in my home folder.
2. I tried the new versions of VTK with QT and it appears that the -l
commands that I put in the .pro file for linking (i.e. -lvtkIO) don't seem
to work...is there a document somewhere that helps in this regard? I
reverted to an older version of VTK for now but I want to eventually
upgrade.

Did you set the PYTHONPATH to /Applications/paraview.app/Contents/Python/paraview?
If so, try one directory shorter:
export PYTHONPATH=/Applications/paraview.app/Contents/Python

I think you are looking for paraview from inside the paraview directory.

Hope this helps-

Hello,

I also added the address to this folder to my pythonpath. I don't know
what else to do to get "pvpthon"  working. Right now when I try to import
"simple" or "servermanager" in the python environment, I get the
following error: "ImportError: No module named paraview".

Any ideas what can I do?
Thanks

Subject: [Paraview] Basic question about installing Paraview for parallel use
Message-ID: <BF76E3D4-4672-4F72-B4B1-BF825DE96507@gmail.com>

Hello,

I don't have much knowledge in setting up parallel system and have never installed anything on a parallel server myself. I have been told to install paraview for our research group so that we can use it parallel.  I have a some very basic questions:

1) I have one linux workstation which has 32 processors in itself. Can I install Paraview on this one single machine and check that if I am able to run it in parallel (with multiple processors) or this won't be considered as installing Paraview in parallel? 

2) When I actually install Paraview on a parallel cluster,  where should I be installing Paraview? Any useful documentation?

Every little amount of information will be useful :)
Thanks,
Pradeep

I want to use Paraview on a parallel cluster but I don't have the root permissions. So if I install Paraview locally in my account, can I still use it in parallel with all efficiency? Or do I need to bug the System Administrator of the parallel cluster to install in the root account?

Thank you,

does anyone have any idea that if we are not short of computational resources, what is the maximum data file size that Paraview can handle?

Depends on whether you are using the mpi or scalar version (scalar 
requires large local memory).

Our Paraview 3.14.1 server is installed by root. My client version is 
the binary 3.14.1 version that I downloaded. I visualize using the 
parallel mode with no difficulties.

Subject: [Paraview] wxpython and paraview 3.98
Message-ID: <50CEEE67.4050902@ill.fr>

Hello everybody,

I just started recently to work with paraview. It looks great. I 
installed the latest version (3.98) on a windows 7 64 bit machine.
I faced troubles when trying to use the wxpython backend. You will find 
enclosed the scripts that triggered the troubles:

Here they are:

     - wxpython is not shipped by default with paraview (an import wx in 
the python shell failed). So, I had to install it by myself
       in C:\Program Files (x86)\ParaView 
3.98.0\lib\paraview-3.98\site-packages. Is this normal ?

     - the standard wxpython installation process with the creation of a 
wx.pth file in the aformentionned directory seems to be
       broken. Indeed, an import wx still failed. To make it work, I had 
to add the following awful hack at the beginning of my script:

       ##################################
       import os
       import sys
       if os.name == 'nt':
sys.path.append(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(sys.exec_prefix),'lib','paraview-3.98','site-packages','wx-2.8-msw-unicode')) 

       ##################################

      This hack does more or less doing what is normally done with the 
standard .pth files process. Is this also something known ?

     - when ran in command line with the python console shipped with 
paraview (pvpython.exe) the script works. When ran in
       paraview through the macros process, the contents of the 
ellipsoids.txt file is not flushed on the listbox. The problem seems to
       be related with the opening of the 'ellipsoids.txt' file and also 
occured on an ubuntu machine ? Very weird.

     - when I used the docstring with the following format:
           '''blablabla
           '''
       the script can not be executed from paraview. I have to format 
them as they are in the enclosed scripts ?

for all these reasons, I have the feeling that the python shipped with 
paraview is not a standard one or something is done on top of it.
Am I right ?

Would you have any idea of what is going wrong with my script (or with 
paraview) ?

thank you very much

Using parallel IO and HDF5, I've worked happily with some files of about 10TB. There is no real limit to the size paraview can handle, it's more about the filesystem and the efficiency of your reader, its parallel decomposition and the number of cores you have available. I think you're really trying to ask, how big a dataset can you manage? In which case the answer is as above - the system you are using is the limiting resource.

Subject: [Paraview] Animation AND Coprocessing - the right file format,
 vtk or xdmf?

Hi Claudio,

For co-processing, I haven't tried writing out everything into a single
xdmf format. I'm not sure how well that would work as I don't know enough
about the internals of the xdmf writer. The problem I see is that if it
tries to keep things in memory and writing it all in one shot it could
cause serious memory issues. If it just appends the file it could work
though.

Another alternative though if you just want to view the results with
co-processing is to use the live in-situ option. To do that, when exporting
the Python co-processing script check the "Live Visualization" option. Then
when running, start up the ParaView GUI and select Tools->Connect to
Catalyst. This is still experimental though so there may be a couple of
other issues to get past in order to get it working properly.

Subject: [Paraview] Software Rendering or Hardware Rendering
Message-ID: <B5C60BF18F36439EBB1582E62ACA7077@HackelPC>

Hi,

I try to use Paraview 3.14 in parallel. My server has 48 CPUs and good GPUs (I don?t know exactly which ones are on the server).
Is it better to use Software or Hardware Rendering?
Well, I?m not sure if my Paraview takes usage of the GPUs or only of the CPUs. The server admin thinks that Paraview can?t really use the GPUs of the server, but how can I find out if my Paraview uses Software or Hardware Rendering?

Thanks,
Kevin

Hi Kevin,

ParaView can use  the GPU's and serial rendering performance is better 
with the GPU. Parallel performance is a little harder to pin down, since 
when multiple processes feed the same GPU this creates resource 
contention which when the ratio of processes to GPU's is high hurts 
performance. The performance you see all depends on the specific GPUs 
and CPUs in question and the specifics of your use case such as dataset 
size, poly's vs volume rendering, number of procs per gpu and so on.

You could very easily have two ParaView builds, one for hardware 
rendering and one for software rendering available on the same system 
and select the one to use as needed.

To use PV in parallel you need to build it yourself, I'm assuming you 
have done this. If you haven't taken precautions to build PV for use 
with OSMesa then you are using what ever OpenGL library is found, you 
can take a look in the CMake cache to see what was found or you could 
use the ldd command on one of the compiled libraries, point it at one of 
VTK's open gl rendering libs.

I have had issues with older versions of Qt.  Update Qt to a more recent version?  4.6.2 is something like 3 years old.  I am using qt 4.8.1.  For me, I am getting libX from the standard place - /usr/lib64/...  Sounds crazy, but make sure it is in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH?

Try servermanager.Fetch()

That will return the result of the filter to you as a vtk object on
the client (so you are using a cluster to access big data, don't do
this). From there you can query it directly.

If you are on a cluster and working with big data, use the python
programmable filter to query the data where it lives on the server.

I am not familiar with wxpython, so not sure what might be the issues
you're running into to. However, just to answer your question about
Python version shipped with ParaView, it is not a modified version, we
directly build from source and package the generated binaries. For
information about which version was packaged, refer to
http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView_Binaries.

If things are working in pvpython and not with the GUI, my guess is
that it has something to do with event loops. ParaView has the Qt
event loop always active and the Python shell is indeed running in the
same main thread, FWIW.

Alan,

What files are you packaging, if I may ask? You should still be able
to add such install rules to Applications/ParaView/CMakeLists.txt,

This is not supported in ParaView currently. Feel free to add a
feature request to the ParaView bug tracker (http://paraview.org/Bug).
There are ways to set a image as the background, if that helps, but
then the image will appear under any geometry you render.

Try this: apply "Extract Selection" filter. This will generate a new
dataset which comprises of only the selected cells/points. Now, you
can save the data as CSV thus save the 3D point coordinates.

Looks like some OpenGL errors. Try picking "Ray Cast Only" as the
"Volume Rendering Mode". Does that help?

One easy fix is to simply manually interact (Left-click and drag) with
the chart and change the axis ranges. Then the ranges will remain
fixed over the animation.

You can combine results from multiple "Extract Selection->Calcualtor"
pipelines using a "Append" filter or a "Group DataSets" filter. Does
that help?

Not currently. The glyph filter always produces polydata i.e. surface
elements. You can use "Glyph with Custom Source" to select arbitrary
polydata to use for glyphs, but that has to be polydata.

As you may have figured out by now, "Box" is not a volumetric box, but
simply a surface comprising of 6 planes and hence PlotOverLine shows
discontinuous line.

What is "Martin Cube"? Do you mean "Marching Cubes"? Volume
representation attempts to render the full volumetric dataset by
mapping scalar values to opacity (google volume rendering for more
details) while Marching Cubes extracts an iso surface for a specific
value(s) in the volumetric dataset and hence surfaces are rendered
(google iso surface for details)

I believe OGG-support is automatically enabled when possible. Look
into your CMakeCache.txt file. You should see various stubs referring
to vtkoggtheora.

Not really an answer to your question, but I'd recommend giving ninja
(http://martine.github.com/ninja/) a try. I've had less frustrations
building on Windows using Ninja than nmake or VS IDE.

Dear Utkarsh,

thanks for your quick answer. You may be right concerning why pvpython 
works while the
GUI fails. I will give a try with PyQt4. Given the small size of my 
macros, it is worth trying to port it on PyQt4.
Concerning PyQt4, I have the same question as for wxpython. PyQt4 is not 
shipped by default with
paraview. I guess that I have also to install it in C:\Program Files 
(x86)\ParaView 3.98.0\lib\paraview-3.98\site-packages.
Right ?

thanks a lot for your help

Eric

You don't necessarily have to install it there, just make sure you
setup the sys.path variable to help find pyqt.

A logging application, that then calls ParaView.  We also include an application that can ssh into the clusters from Windows, for remote server connections.

Thanks - I will give it a try.

Alan,

What files are you packaging, if I may ask? You should still be able to add such install rules to Applications/ParaView/CMakeLists.txt,
just replace PV_INSTALL_BIN_DIR with VTK_INSTALL_RUNTIME_DIR.

That's really odd. Looking at the call stacks, it looks like the the
code on both processes is at the right location: both are calling
MPI_Finalize(). I verified that MPI_Finalize() does indeed gets called
once (by adding a break point on MPI_Finalize in pvbatch). Burlen, can
you peek into the files (finalize.c, adi.c etc.) to see if we can spot
why the two processes diverge?

yeah it's a strange one....

The clues we have at this point are the 5 ctests that have been failing 
on the nautilus dashboard. 
http://open.cdash.org/viewTest.php?onlyfailed&buildid=2719388, and 
3.14.1 doesn't have the issue (it's still running OK).

I'll see if I can narrow down when the issue started, and if the mpi  
binaries have debugging symbols I will see if I can walk through.

Hi Deb,

You can use this vector reader (uses GDAL) and ParaView plugin to load your
SRTM DEM. I will see if we can this reader and plugin into ParaView proper.
I have long desired it but we don't have any direct funding for it but
nonetheless I will have it in proper VTK / ParaView by the end of the year.

Thanks,

I couldn't reproduce the crash. I wonder if it has to do with the
Volume Mapper used. Try changing the value of the property
"VolumeRenderingMode" in the state file to "2" i.e. "Ray Cast Only" or
some of the other values, as  listed in the domain for that property
in the state file. Does that over come the segfault?

Thanks for the info Aashish

I'd be happy to see next ParaView version, with your gdal/ogr reader

I don't build ParaView from source, but use provided binary installer for Windows
I believe making build environment on Windows is far from trivial

Nice to know there's still a good chance that the GDAL vector reader
could go into ParaView proper. The reader has been working so great
for me for more than a year that I really hope to see it fully
integrated with ParaView/VTK.

Hi Deb,

Initially I thought you are using SRTM Vector but your dataset is SRTM
Raster, which is fine, its just that I have to use my vtkGDALRaster reader
to read the data.
Attached is the image that I generated using my reader and VTK. Does this
look right to you?  Now for some reason your dataset had missing band
information. Are you creating this dataset? I think its about time
I need to get these two readers into VTK / ParaView.

Thanks,

Thanks Takuya for your help and encouragement. I will update the reader to
VTK 6 (almost done) and will get into VTK / ParaView.

Message-ID: <loom.20121219T211258-479@post.gmane.org>

Hello,

I am running Paraview in batch mode using a Python script to analyze my data.
However, after looping through few files ny script gets terminated because of a 
memory overload. Is it possible to deallocate the used memory after a file has 
been processed?
Currently I am using the "Delete()" command which does not do the 
job.

Best,
Sebastian

Hi Sebastian,

What version of ParaView are you using? Pre-3.14 suffered from
http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=12424. An issue similar to what
you described and a workaround for it got discussed last year, see
http://markmail.org/message/72qrmqwjaxmgsa7h.

Hi Aashish,

Attached image looks correct. I attached the same rendered by qgis (gdal) and also 2-page PDF file describing the dataset, provided by DLR

I'm not creating this data, but use it ready made.
If by missing band information you think about gaps in dataset, then that's as expected, and it's roughly explained in PDF attachment.

Looking forward to your gdal/ogr readers :)
That would be quite a feature in ParaView.


Thanks

It works but I see the following errors...

ERROR: In

vtkOpenGLExtensionManager (000000000DC19440): Extension GL_VERSION_1_2 could

Could it be the latest NVIDIA driver?  

I was on 305.60 and also tried 310.70 with the same result.

I couldn't reproduce the crash. I wonder if it has to do with the Volume
Mapper used. Try changing the value of the property "VolumeRenderingMode" in
the state file to "2" i.e. "Ray Cast Only" or some of the other values, as
listed in the domain for that property in the state file. Does that over
come the segfault?

Hello Karl,

thank you for your message. I am using Paraview 3.14.1 (64bit).

This is what my script looks like:

# SETTINGS
directory_pvtu    = '/scratch/mesh3mm_SEM/'
directory_csv     = '/scratch/mesh3mm_SEM/Z085_velocity_data/'
file_number_start = 373527
file_number_end   = 640332
file_interval     = 693
file_name_pvtu    = 'mesh3mm_SEM###file_number###.pvtu'
file_name_csv     = 'mesh3mm_SEM###file_number###.csv'

print 'Script started!'

try: paraview.simple
except: from paraview.simple import *

while file_number_start <= file_number_end :

  current_file_name_pvtu = file_name_pvtu.replace('###file_number###', 
str(file_number_start))
  current_file = XMLPartitionedUnstructuredGridReader( FileName=[directory_pvtu 
+ current_file_name_pvtu] )

  current_file.PointArrayStatus = ['Velocity']

  SetActiveSource(current_file)

  Slice1 = Slice( SliceType = 'Plane' )
  Slice1.SliceOffsetValues = [0.0]
  Slice1.SliceType.Origin = [0.0, 0.0, 0.136711]
  Slice1.SliceType.Normal = [0.0, 0.0, 1.0]

  SetActiveSource(Slice1)

  Slice2 = Slice( SliceType = 'Plane' )
  Slice2.SliceOffsetValues = [0.0]
  Slice2.SliceType.Origin = [0.0, 0.227757, 0.0]
  Slice2.SliceType.Normal = [0.0, 1.0, 0.0]

  UpdatePipeline()
  current_file_name_csv = file_name_csv.replace('###file_number###', 
str(file_number_start))
  writer = CreateWriter(directory_csv + current_file_name_csv, Slice2)
  writer.FieldAssociation = 'Points'
  writer.UpdatePipeline()
  del writer

  Delete(Slice2)
  Delete(Slice1)
  Delete(current_file)

  files_to_go = (file_number_end-file_number_start)/file_interval
  if files_to_go == 1:
    case_word = 'file'
  else:
    case_word = 'files'
  print current_file_name_csv + ' created, ' + str(files_to_go) + ' more ' + 
case_word + ' to go!'

  file_number_start += file_interval

print 'Script finished!'

Not sure why it isn't garbage collecting for you, but you might try
moving the entire pipeline setup out of the loop and then inside the
loop just call the two set filenames to modify the existing pipeline
before calling Write().

I believe the filter won't get deleted until after the proxy goes out of
scope. If I'm right, you need to call Delete() on it and then have the
variable that's holding the proxy either go out of scope or set to
something else.

Thanks for your consideration Aashish :)

I'm fine with whatever timing is appropriate according your plans.

I opened this discussion couple of days ago. I'm new to ParaView and was looking for a way to read these datasets, as I'm having problems with grass nviz 3D visualizer on Windows.
In the meantime I read the data with mayavi, as it was easier to me to make it read and further manipulate.
Hopefully I can use your readers soon, in nice environment as ParaView seems to offer.

Subject: [Paraview] Input file format
Message-ID: <7A55BEBE-A6F6-4015-AB2F-D525E895BCC3@gmail.com>

Hello,

I am confused about what should be the input format of the data file that I want Paraview to read? 

I have attached a simple data file as example below that I want to plot in 3D on Paraview.  I have a few
questions:

1) When I input this data in a CSV format or a txt format, Paraview just shows me a spreadsheet 
and does not give any options for converting it into a plot. The properties section does not even 
show the list of variables.

2) If I have a uniform grid like this, do I need to enter the coordinates? What will be a more efficient format?

3) If I write the data (in a binary format) using Fortran90, what should be the order of my data? 

4) Out of curiosity, is there any data format more compressed than a binary format? I hear that many people
use the HDF5 format for huge scientific data. What is the significant advantage of this format over normal binary
data produced by fortran?

Thank you,
Pradeep

Subject: [Paraview] HDF5 and Paraview
Message-ID: <822ED276-6D5D-426A-85C1-8BE7FE05B7FC@gmail.com>

Hello,

I dont understand something. In all of Paraview manuals it says that it is compatible with HDF5 file format. I am using Paraview 3.98.
I wrote a data file using HDF for fortran and generated a file (filename.h5). But when I am tried to open it, "*.h5" was not in the list of supported
file formats. 

Paraview gives me the message "A reader for filename.h5 could not be found. Please choose one: <followed by a long list of readers>".
Even in that long list there are no HDF5 readers, so I just started trying everything and finally succeeded with "NetCDF files generic and
CF conventions" (I don't even know what it is). 

But it is not reassuring. I don't know if this will work for any other data set. Am I missing something here?

Thanks
Pradeep

I think you need to replace "del writer" with "Delete(writer)".

ParaView has a proxy manager that keeps all proxies.  Proxies will not be
deleted when the python reference is deleted, you must explicitly call
paraview.simple.Delete().  The return value of CreateWriter is a proxy, so
it must be Delete()'d.

+1 for Dave's suggestion, build the pipeline and writer before the loop.

Hi,

Can any one confirm this bug.

ParaView 3.98.0 (official binary) (Linux 64bit ubuntu 12.04).

Sources -> Wavelet (Wavelet1)
Calculator  (Calulator1)

Sources -> Wavelet (Wavelet2)

Now right click to the calculator1 and change in put to the calculator2

Finally delete Wavelet1 and Paraview Crashes.

Felipe

I've had similar crashes when I change input. Didn't testyour example but exactly the same problem with other combinations

Hdf5 is very flexible so one reader cannot cope with all possibilities. You need to know which hdf5 reader you need and target that format

Hello,

I am trying to calculate the vorticity of a velocity vector field in Paraview 
3.14.1 (64bit).
I tried using the "Compute Derivatives" and "Gradient Of Unstructured DataSet"
filters but both return completely different results.
Also, the results do not match with my reference data at all.
What is the correct way to calculate the vorticity from a velocity vector field
in Paraview?

Best,
Sebastian

TBD is good for bugs reported by community (Or you can even leave it
empty). When the bug gets taken over by a project for fixing, we
update the project as needed.

I've pushed a fix for this. GIve it a try on git-master after the next
gatekeeper review (after Friday).

Use csv reader and then the properties panel lets you state if the first
row is a header with variable names.

Apply the TableToPoints filter or the TableToStructuredGrid filter to let
ParaView know that the table the the reader produces holds scientific (3D
spatial) data. Since a text file can contain anything, we need this to know
what this particular text file holds.

Yes, raw binary data, read in via the raw (binary) reader. Use the
properties panel of that reader to state the number of dimensions, the
extent in those dimensions, the word size, endianess and number of
variables.

Not sure, I think it is kjiv, but you'll have to confirm that.

Interoperability with many programs over any custom format, better
performance and higher level access primitives (striding etc).
As John said in another email hdf5 just like text and raw files can hold
anything, so ParaView needs some context to interpret the contents of the
hdf5 file. xdmf and netcdf4 readers add a layer than can provide that
context.

Perhaps I'll elaborate on John's response a little bit.

As John alluded to, Hdf5 is not really a file format in that it does not
specify any semantic meaning to the data.  Hdf5 is just a storage
mechanism for arrays of data.  It is self describing in that it provides
enough metadata to determine the basic data type, dimensions, name,
attributes, and hierarchical namespace, but this is not enough for any
reader to reliably build mesh structures from.  For example, say there is
an array stored in an Hdf5 file called "pts".  Is this a list of point
indices?  Is this a collection of point coordinates that form a
curvilinear grid?  A list of point coordinates around triangles?  A bag of
point coordinates that will be indexed by some other array?  Maybe pts
doesn't mean points at all.

The relevance of this discussion is that simply providing the Hdf5 is not
sufficient to present data.  The data has to follow some convention (or
have that convention otherwise specified).

But not to worry.  This question of reading Hdf5 files comes up a lot on
the ParaView mailing list and there exists a general solution: XDMF.  XDMF
is a simple XML descriptor file that you place next to your h5 file.  The
XDMF file describes what is called the schema for the data in the Hdf5
file: That is, it defines the structure of the data.

XDMF files can be created through the XDMF library or you can create the
XML file to describe an existing h5 file by hand.  Based on the fact that
the generic NetCDF reader works (a coincidence whose technical details I
won't go into), I expect the describing XDMF file to be small and easy to
write.  See the XDMF documentation at www.xdmf.org for more details.

the memory leak has definitely something to do with the writer
as everything works well when I run my script without it.
Is there any other way to delete the writer after a file has been processed?

Hi Aashish,

this week I've written a new Interactor style to use a 3dconnexion 
SpaceNavigator in Paraview with vrpn server. Translational motion works 
fine in parallel and orthogonal projection but rotation is not finished yet.

Two things I did not solve:
- the first time a new Interaction is created, PV crashes when the point 
vtkVRQueue:Enqueue, this->Mutex->Lock() is reached (called by 
newAnalogValue), if I use "Restore State" it works -> I think anything 
has to be initialized but did not find it.
- rotation of the scene is confusing to me. I have as input 3 analog 
values (roll/pitch/yaw) between -1 and +1. I tried to map this to 
CameraViewUp with euler-zyx-Transformation. But it does not work as 
expected.

Question at all: what would be the best way to map a scalar value to the 
rotation of a scene/view ? What does the buttons roll/pitch/yaw in the 
camera-property-menue ? I think I would need exact the same functions 
behind theses 3 buttons.

Here is the code-snippet I tried for that:

     vtkSMPropertyHelper( proxy, "CameraViewUp" ).Get( rot, 3 ); //rotation
     phi= data.data.analog.channel[3]*M_PI/180;
     theta= data.data.analog.channel[4]*M_PI/180;
     psi= data.data.analog.channel[5]*M_PI/180;

      double x=rot[0];
      double y=rot[1];
      double z=rot[2];

      double tt[3][3];
      tt[0][0]=cos(theta)*cos(psi);
  tt[0][1]=-cos(phi)*sin(psi)+sin(phi)*sin(theta)*cos(psi);
  tt[0][2]=sin(phi)*sin(psi)+cos(phi)*sin(theta)*cos(psi);

      tt[1][0]=cos(theta)*sin(psi);
  tt[1][1]=cos(phi)*cos(psi)+sin(phi)*sin(theta)*cos(psi);
  tt[1][2]=-sin(phi)*cos(psi)+cos(phi)*sin(theta)*sin(psi);

      tt[2][0]=-sin(theta);
      tt[2][1]=sin(phi)*cos(theta);
      tt[2][2]=cos(phi)*cos(theta);

      rot[0] = x*tt[0][0]+y*tt[0][1]+z*tt[0][2];
      rot[1] = x*tt[1][0]+y*tt[1][1]+z*tt[1][2];
      rot[2] = x*tt[2][0]+y*tt[2][1]+z*tt[2][2];

      vtkSMPropertyHelper( proxy, "CameraViewUp" ).Set( rot, 3 );

I attached the sourcecode, maybe someone has time over christmas to have 
a look.

Have a nice Christmas time & happy new year,
Christian

Christian,

It seems we have a common interest in adding support for the
SpaceNavigator to ParaView. I wrote a style for just this purpose and
posted it on gerrit:

http://review.source.kitware.com/#/t/1646/

This style rotates and translates the world and not individual objects.

I think my topic addresses both of your unresolved issues. Would you
care to checkout out this topic and try it out?

Thank you,
Cory

Hi Sohail,

Changing the number of fields from 23 to 16 fixed the warnings. I'll get
these changes into VTK and then change ParaView so that it can read in
WindBlade files with a single process. That may take a week or so though.

As for the other questions:

1) If the data directories are called VTKData, VTKLargeData, and
ParaViewData and they share the same parent directory as VTK or ParaView,
when you build VTK or ParaView it will automatically pick up the path to
each of them.

2) For the library names, after modularization they've been changed and
relocated from the bin subdirectory to the lib subdirectory. Many of the
old libraries have been subdivided into better organized libraries. I don't
know any specific document that specifies what to do for this though.

Thanks. Please take your time.  If there any other problems with this
reader then feel free to consult me.

1) typically I make a separate build directory for VTK or ParaView. The
test I ran looked for "../../../../vtkData" or something like that, so it
seems like the test executable has to be four directories deep. So I guess
there is a common parent to the data folders and paraview, not sure what
this parent would be or if there is a reference for this hierarchy.

2) I guess in this case I would have to experiment when I do make the
switch to the newer VTK

Thanks for the response everyone and thanks for the detailed response Ken.
It made things a bit more clearer.

But still I dont understand that once I create a Hdf5 data, and even I
create a XDMF file, how can I be sure which reader to use for the data? So
every time I switch to a new data, chances are I might have to try out all
the readers one by one, till one of them plots it fine?
Is there something I am missing?

Thanks,
Pradeep

 analog input from 3Dconnexion device
Message-ID: <20121221083813.9046399umur87sv9@webmail.uni-magdeburg.de>

Hi Cory,

thats awesome, thank you so much for sharing this.

I would suggest the following change in HandleAnalog to support  
parallel-projection deph-scaling because moving in Z-Direction has no  
effect:

int mode = camera->GetParallelProjection();
     if (mode) {
	//in case of parallel projection: moving in deph-direction has no  
effect, so needs scaling
	pscale = camera->GetParallelScale();
	pscale += 0.05*channel[1];
	camera->SetParallelScale( pscale );
     }

However, the segfault remains at Enqueue for the first time a Style is  
arranged via the GUI Panel:
(if you load a state file it works and becaue I only want to set up  
the Interactor Pipeline once and start with a state file it is not a  
big problem)

Subject: [Paraview] Creating vectors using multiple files and Vector
	projections on a Slice
Message-ID: <551ADC76-6877-4F36-9670-FB5DF43F03FC@gmail.com>

Hello,

I have three files containing the 3 scalar magnitudes of the 3 components of a 3D velocity vector. How to I visualize the final vector and its streamlines using Paraview?

Also, is it possible to visualize the projection of this final vector on both sides of a slice of the computational domain? The computational domain is a simple cube with 512 grid
points in each direction.

Thank you,
Pradeep

Use AppendAttributes filter to get the data from the three files
together in one place.
Use calculator filter with expression
array1sname*iHat+array2sname*jHat+rarray3sname*kHat to create the
vector field.

See also the python programmable filters for an alternative.

Not sure what you are trying to do with the second question.

Subject: [Paraview] pvpython without graphics
Message-ID: <F0619AF235EBD540980A3B17975D63BA141AEA@046-CH1MPN1-042.046d.mgd.msft.net>

Hello list,
Is it possible to execute a pvpython script without a valid x-windows display? Maybe a no-graphics flag or environmental setting?

I am using paraview to post-process .vtk files in batch mode. It would be ideal not to have to rely on a display.

Thanks!
William

You will need to compile ParaView with OSMesa support. Refer to
http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/ParaView_And_Mesa_3D for details.

Hi Pradeep,

David gave you a great answer which illustrates ParaView's flexibility 
nicely. I would add that, for reasons of convenience, performance, and 
efficient memory use, your best bet is to find a parallel capable reader 
for your data format, or to tweak your output into one of the existing 
formats.

For example, the BOV reader in the SciberQuestToolKit plugin handles 
uniform and stretched cartesian meshes like you have and it expects 
vector components in separate files. There are some usage notes about 
this reader here: http://www.hpcvis.com/vis/sq-bov-reader.html If you 
try it feel free to ping me off list with any questions.

I believe XDMF could also read raw binary data (sans hdf5). Having not 
used this myself, I don't the details, and I couldn't give it a strong 
endorsement. However, it maybe worth looking into.

Burlen

See http://paraview.org/Wiki/Data_formats for an example of xdmf
reading binary files.

There is probably an xdmf way to get around the need to use the
calculator filter to merge scalar arrays into a vector - but I
couldn't quite get it to work when I made that example up.

Hi Christian,

Sorry for the late reply. Not directly answering your question, but would
like to inform you that we (Mostly Dave and some me) recently made
improvements to the VR Plugin and now its merged back into master.

(13598-VRGrabWorldFix in master now)

I am wondering if you would like to update / test your code against today's
master. If you have some specific questions, we should be able to help.

Thanks,

Hi,

I'm not sure if this is relevant to your discussion, but I just wanted to
make sure you guys are aware of this class in VTK:

Dear All

We are developing a parallel (MPI) package written in C. Can anybody suggest how we can get started on producing 2D and 3D VTK output of structured meshes and scalar fields. A few simple standalone programs that give pointers on how the VTK/Paraview functions are called will also be helpful.

many thanks

Subject: [Paraview] Categorical data in scalar bar
Message-ID: <2117353575.1795383.1356714828007.JavaMail.root@mail.gatech.edu>

Hi,

We have a dataset that ranges from 0 to 7 and represents categorical data. Is it possible through a python script to explicitly set the tick labels on a scalar bar so I can manually map them to strings? For instance:

{0.0 -> "None", 1.0 -> "I", 2.0 -> "J",...} 

Thanks,

Tim

Hi,

I also had a crash with a similar backtrace (which includes
Manta::Mesh::~Mesh()) using PV 3.98.0 and Manta r2541 (the latest
revision as of today) when I tried changing a display property of a
Manta view (displaying a non-OpenFOAM dataset).

The problem looks like that vtkMantaPolyDataMapper allocates a series
of Manta objects as an array whereas Manta::Mesh::~Mesh() tries to
delete them individually. Thus the attached patch fixed the problem
for me.

I filed a bug with the patch attached:

Hi, Christian,
   It seems just adding back the XML description is enough to fix this. Can
you verify by applying the attached patch and see if it works for you? ( cd
to your ParaView source dir, and run "git apply add-particle-path.diff" ).

   Note that, to differentiate from the new stuff, I have changed the
filter name from "Particle Pathlines" --> "Temporal Particles To Pathlines".

thanks,
Leo

In my previous version of paraview (3.10?) "Clip Closed Surface" sort of worked, however it was hit and miss as to whether you'd get a nice closure of the clipped surface.  i.e. moving the clipping plane slightly would lead to unpredictable "holes" in the closure surface.

So I have downloaded the latest version to see if things have improved.  Clip Closed Surface now causes paraview to crash.  It does so on very simple geometries (e.g. try making a sphere form source then apply clip closed surface.....).

If someone does know of a version where this filter worked, I'd be very grateful....

Bob.
