Hello !
 
Paraview 3.6.2 stereo Crystall Eyes works now perfect in paraview after changing the compostit parameters,  just reading in a gaussian .cube file , and the hole paraview stopes and returns to the OS, another question i would like the know if a  Maintance of paraview is possible ?

These have been discussed before, and I believe there was at least a
partial solution proposed.

As I recall, there are two related issues, volume rendering in parallel,
and when saving a screen shot that is larger than the regular render
window. In both cases empty lines appear at the edges of the sub-volume
that was volume rendered as part of the larger image.

When I get  to the lab today I'll search my e-mail archive for these
threads... Pester me if I don't get back to you.

It seems that the latest updates to Mesa in Fedora 12 have fixed this
problem (Mesa is now updated to 7.7 and Paraview to 3.6.2 in F12).
Although I'm not sure when this happened -- I just now noticed it when
trying to reproduce the bug to do a git-bisect to track down the cause.
Could others with Fedora 12 and Intel video chipsets verify that it is
indeed fixed?

Hey Utkarsh,

I tried this and it worked beautifully on OS X, but I'm hitting a problem on Ubuntu. When I run ccmake it complains:

CMake Error at
 /home/emonson/Programming/ParaView_cvs/ParaView3/CMake/ParaViewBranding.cmake:
 254 (TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES):
   Target "SMPVSlabClipDataSet" of type MODULE_LIBRARY may not be linked into
   another target.  One may link only to STATIC or SHARED libraries, or to
   executables with the ENABLE_EXPORTS property set.

   If you are developing a new project, re-organize it to avoid linking to
   modules.  If you are just trying to build an existing project, set
   CMAKE_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY to 2.2 or lower to allow linking to modules.
 Call Stack (most recent call first):
   MSI_Strip3/CMakeLists.txt:42 (build_paraview_client)

This error is listed for both of the plugins I'm trying to build and link along with my branded PV. It doesn't list the problem for the Point Sprites plugin that I'm linking in but built along with my PV build. Both of the plugins use the standard ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN() call in their CMakeLists.txt files. 

My build of ParaView on that machine has BUILD_SHARED_LIBS: ON (but VTK_USE_RPATH: OFF to make the install stuff work). It's 64-bit Ubuntu 9.10 and I'm using CMake 2.6 patch 4 and CVS ParaView from Jan 14.

I'll try using the "cmake backwards compatibility" to 2.2, but do you have any ideas about why this would work on OS X, but not on Ubuntu?

Thanks a lot,
-Eric

You may want to update your CVS ParaView (or atleast the CMake dir in
it). For a little while linking directly against plugins was broken.

Is the data for the racecar on the paraview.org main page and the flow field
around it available?

If not, is there any similar data set? I am just looking to play around with
velocity fields and streamlines, etc.

Thanks,

Subject: [Paraview] Multiple colormaps
Message-ID: <2C8D352D-43A0-4C94-AC25-13F9B70EA1F3@Vanderbilt.Edu>

Hello,

I was wondering if it is possible to have two different colormaps
within one scene.  I have the following structure :

-ImageData.mha
   --Slice (Visible)
-BinarySegmented.mha
--Contour
--ResampleWithDataset (Visible)

Image Data is a 3D image. Binary Segemented is my region of interest,
which I create a iso-surface and color it using resample with
dataset.  I would like the surface to use a blue-red colormap, while
the slice uses a grayscale.

Is this possible in paraview?

Thank you for any help.

ParaView maintains one colormap per field (as identified by the name).  If you want the same field colored two different ways, you will have to rename the field.  The easiest way to do this is to use the calculator to create a new field with a different name but with the same data.

Thank you very much.  Simply changing the structure to the following  
worked as you described:

-ImageData.mha
   --Calculator
      ---Slice (Visible)
-BinarySegmented.mha
   --Contour
   --ResampleWithDataset (Visible)

I just noticed on the ParaView dashboard, which I believe was recently updated, that now individual warnings, errors, and tests are flagged on an individual basis so that I can look at a glance, for example, if a recent change I made fixed or broke any tests.  Way cool feature!

It's not possible to label all point indexes, however you can select
the cells/points  (using the controls in  the Selection Controls
Toolbar), then goto the "Selection Inspector" (View | Selection
Inspector). At the bottom, there's a tab with "Point Label", on that
tab check the "Visible" checkbox and ensure that the Label Mode is
"Point IDs". This will show labels for the selected points.

There is a builtin python command 'execfile' that can do this.  From the
python console- help(execfile)

Just to update: - it didn't work in ParaView either.  I actually meant
pvpython.  Adding the code explained everything though:


Failed to initialize proxy 'NewView' in group 'views'

Thanks Pat

Where's the "NewView" proxy coming from? Is it in your custom application's XML?

It's from a plugin that I created when I was trying to add another view - I

Subject: [Paraview] Customising ParaView GUI filter
Message-ID: <5CDA7263292348C4A82E4FA788764A3D@win.ara>

Dear All,

I've been testing the flexibility within ParaView for creating GUI
interfaces to filters, without having to custom develop them using Qt
designer. One of the items I'm failing to recreate is the table of Offset
Values that you get, for example, with the Contour and Slice filters. All
that appears is a slide widget like what you get with a Threshold filter.
The rest of the GUI is ok and the filter works as it should. Has anyone
tried this before and know where I'm going wrong? The code I am using is
taken from 'Servers/ServerManager/Resources/filters.xml':

     <DoubleVectorProperty
        name="ContourValues"
        command="SetValue"
        repeat_command="1"
        set_number_command="SetNumberOfContours"
        number_of_elements_per_command="1"
        use_index="1"
        animateable="1"
        label="Slice Offset Values">
          <BoundsDomain name="bounds" mode="magnitude">
            <RequiredProperties>
              <Property name="Input" function="Input"/>
            </RequiredProperties>
          </BoundsDomain>
          <Documentation>
            The values in this property specify a list of current offset
values. This can be used to create multiple slices with different centers.
Each entry represents a new slice with its center shifted by the offset
value.
          </Documentation>
     </DoubleVectorProperty>
     <Hints>
       <Visibility replace_input="2" />
     </Hints>
   <!-- End Cut -->
   </SourceProxy>


Does anyone have any idea what I'm missing?

Cheers,
Adriano

The widget like that on the Contour Panel cannot be auto-generated
using the XML, unfortunately. We use a custom Qt panel for the contour
filter. Look at Qt/Components/pqContourPanel

Subject: [Paraview] Not a valid QT plugin on windows
Message-ID: <FFE6C9A2-E41B-4970-918D-1B53125DE970@ucalgary.ca>

Following this thread: http://markmail.org/message/f25hi3bl6ldptzav , I'd just like to add that I get exactly the same error.

Namely, we have a number of plugins that compile and load on Linux and on OS-X, but on Windows XP we get a "is not a valid Qt plugin" error when we attempt to load them.

There was some speculation in the thread that this occurs when Visual C++ Express 2008 is used.  This is indeed the compiler that we have used to compile everything (Qt, ParaView, etc...)

Here are some system details:
- ParaView 3.6.2
- Qt 4.3.5
- Windows XP 32 bit
- Visual C++ Express 2008 (version 9)

As a side note, I attempted to set the environment variable PV_PLUGIN_DEBUG as described at http://paraview.org/Wiki/Plugin_HowTo#Debugging_Plugins in order to obtain more information, but it didn't seem to have any effect.  There was no additional output in either the Output Messages window or the terminal from which paraview was started.

Regards,
Eric

I think you get this error if you're missing a dll at runtime? If you place
your plugin in the bin dir of your build and load it from there does it
work?

The PV_PLUGIN_DEBUG variable was added recently in CVS and will be
available with 3.8. It won't work with 3.6.*

Dave,

That did indeed fix the problem.  It was an obvious fix in hindsight.  (The PATH variable was set, but slightly incorrectly it turns out.)

I've added an entry to the "Pitfalls" section of the wiki: http://paraview.org/Wiki/Plugin_HowTo#.22Is_not_a_valid_Qt_plugin.22_in_Windows .

Thanks,
Eric

Subject: [Paraview] Plot over a line: Interpolation method
Message-ID: <cbc405b1002021555o2db75875s4bcd70d53275bb48@mail.gmail.com>

Hi guys,

I was wondering if there is a way to change the interpolation method when
using "plot over a line" filter on a 3D dataset? It seems to me that the
default method is a linear interpolation which is not good enough for what I
am doing right now. Also does anyone know if there is a way to change the
interpolation method for contours, clip, slice and/or other similar filters?

Best,
Mohammad

Subject: [Paraview] Volume Rendering in Paraview - Speed
Message-ID: <4B69480F.5030608@rwth-aachen.de>

Hello!

I am working on a diploma thesis on defect analysis in cast iron. I 
found ITK to be the perfect tool to manipulate my volume data. Now I am 
looking for a tool for visualization. At fist, Paraview seemed to be the 
perfect choice because of its VTK-Plugin capability (and thus ITK). The 
bad thing is that the rendering is far too slow for my needs. At this 
point I could as well store my results in a new file and view them in 
another (faster) viewer. Of course this is not the perfect way either.

Am I missing some configuration or something? What I do is loading a raw 
volume (dimensions: 256x256x110), go to the display tab and choose the 
following options:

Color:
Interpolate Scalars: OFF
Map Scalars: OFF

Style:
Representation: Volume
Interpolation: flat
Material: none

Which seems to be the most basic setup for rendering. When the volume is 
loaded I get frames every 5 seconds. The quality is good, no problems 
there, but any other generic Volume Renderer gives me 20FPS+ (using 
Textures). Maybe it's because the actual mapper does Ray Casting(?). 
There is a field "Volume mapper" in the display tab under "Style" but 
it's not enabled so I can't change anything there...

Has anybody some good advice?

Best regards,
Christian Werner

Gee, now that I've posted this I came to find quite the same topic 
treated before:

http://www.paraview.org/pipermail/paraview/2009-February/011174.html

I am now looking for a way to make it possible to switch between 
different mappers from within paraview. I will post how to that once I 
figured out.

Best regards!

Who at kitware can make a commit with
   "BUG: Added missing vtkOBJReader to ServerManager Resources"
?


An example of the (trivial) change required is attached.

Subject: [Paraview] stereo menu was ignored?
Message-ID: <1e93c9c1002031045o4b277008h4263a4b5bec6850@mail.gmail.com>

I see that ParaViewGeo has a stereo menu to allow users to select
CrystalEyes / Anaglyph stereo modes while paraview is running (NOTE:
without requiring a --stereo flag on the command line). It seems that
one developer: Robert Maynard created the stereo menu and sent the
source code (Stereo.zip) to the ITK mailing list on 9/29/2008. From
what I can tell this message was ignored and no one attempted to
integrate the menu into any other applications related to
Paraview/ITK.

Why?

It seems obvious that this is something users need and want. We will
be using ParaViewGeo instead of ParaView until something like this is
added.

I meant to say 3.4 and 3.6 instead of 2.4 and 2.6.

The patch that I have submitted was for 2.4 code base, with 2.6 all that is
needed is a custom toolbar plugin that calls setStereoType on the currently
active view.

What does that mean regarding the plugin. Does a plugin exist already
or will it need to be written?

ParaView CVS (and 3.8 onwards ) has a command line option
--stereo-type which allows you to choose the stereo type. It's not
really safe to change the stereo type after ParaView has been started
(rather views have been created) since for things like Crystal Eyes,
the option must be enabled before the rendering context is created.
Hence, we've made it a command line option.

I dont agree. Opening in Stereo mode is safe even if it is not used
(it consumes a small amount of memory, but so what). Everything is 2D
if no GL commands render to back left/right buffers (i.e., the GL_BACK
buffer is always available). If you need to verify that the hardware
supports GL_STEREO, use glGetBoolean*() (or glGetInteger*() with
GL_AUX_BUFFERS to know if quad buffers are available) and initialize
GL_STEREO only on machines that can support it.

Why would you want the user to restart paraview if maybe they dont
know their hardware and they arent sure which stereo mode to use?  No!
Give them a menu option and keep them inside your software. Keep in
mind that if I and many others like me have to stop a program, modify
command line options and restart the application to get the right
environment, the whole process should take less than 10 seconds and it
must be FULLY documented or I give up and find an application that
does it better (more intuitive) with less pain.

More reason for a stereo menu: how do you propose control of
properties like Eye Separation?  Clearly the users wont know what
parameter to use until the software is running. Dont make them restart
50 times until they get the parameter just right. Thats absurd!

Another problem: say Im in CrystalEyes mode and I want to export a
movie. There are plenty of stereoscopic display solutions available
today. 3D computer screens, 3D movies, 3D TVs, 3D television channels.
Why cant ParaView export to stereoscopic movie formats (JPS/MPO AVI
format perhaps)? On top of that, if Im in CrystalEyes and I know the
stereo looks good, why cant I export a Stereoscopic movie AND an
anaglyph movie AND a 2D movie so my results can be viewed by audiences
with any capability?

I just started playing with ParaViewGeo's SlideShow capabilities. Did
you know the slides also show in stereo? We're talking full 3D
stereoscopic presentations of scientific results *without* swapping
applications. Why havent you guys looked into integrating all of this?

Message-ID: <4B69D505.2010801@jpl.nasa.gov>

This is probably a simple question, but I haven't been able to find
the answer yet...

I've read in a file with geometry and results, checked the box for
all variables, and then see all the variables in Object Inspector/
Properties (e.g., all the components of stress).  However, in the
variable chooser toolbar, I only see a subset of the variables (e.g.
von Mises stress).

How can I map all the other variables from the Object Inspector?

Thanks,
John Schiermeier

The plugin would have to be written.

Hi John,

To make sure that I understand: you are trying to color the surface by a
variable but it is not showing up in the variable selector on the Active
Variable Control toolbar. Correct? What is the representation type on the
Representation toolbar? Also, did you apply any filters?

Thanks,
-berk

Hi Fred,

I am guessing that this is a filter that you wrote and that you are running
in parallel. If that's case, you need something like:

  vtkInformation *outInfo = outputVector->GetInformationObject(NNN);
  outInfo->Set(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::MAXIMUM_NUMBER_OF_PIECES(),
               -1);

where NNN is the output port number. This goes in RequestInformation().

Best,

You make very compelling points. It definitely makes sense to add such

If I remember correctly, IceT doesn't do well with stereo. I am going
to add a feature request to the bug tracker.

Not in a trivial way. What is the type of the data you are visualizing?

Hi Bart,

Any chance you can attach with a debugger to one of the nodes that crash? It
is hard to tell what is wrong from the errors you posted. We have definitely
run ParaView with OpenMPI with 4 core and more. Also, what do you mean by
"simple VTK file"? Small file? Big file?

The fact is the actual data structure is an OcTree, but I'm using an
unstructured 3D dataset; and the "point data" formatting for my scalar
fields.

Hello,
First I am not running in parallel. I have just written a filter inherited from vtkPolyDataAlgorithm that generates 4 output ports.
I probably did not understand well, what I did is to add the  method:

int
vtkFlowCoordinates::RequestInformation(vtkInformation* vtkNotUsed(request), vtkInformationVector** vtkNotUsed(inputVector), vtkInformationVector* outputVector)
{
  outputVector->GetInformationObject(0)->Set(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::MAXIMUM_NUMBER_OF_PIECES(), -1);
  outputVector->GetInformationObject(1)->Set(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::MAXIMUM_NUMBER_OF_PIECES(), -1);
  outputVector->GetInformationObject(2)->Set(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::MAXIMUM_NUMBER_OF_PIECES(), -1);
  outputVector->GetInformationObject(3)->Set(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::MAXIMUM_NUMBER_OF_PIECES(), -1);
  return 1;
}

but I still get the same errors, even if the result is ok, ie all 4 ports contain polydata, so it is just annoying to get this popup widget with error each time I Apply again!



ERROR: In /usr/local/ParaView3/VTK/Filtering/vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline.cxx, line 806
vtkCompositeDataPipeline (0x2605d570): No maximum number of pieces has been set in the information for output port 1 on algorithm vtkFlowCoordinates(0x2605cc20).

Hi Fred,

I am guessing that this is a filter that you wrote and that you are running in parallel. If that's case, you need something like:

  vtkInformation *outInfo = outputVector->GetInformationObject(NNN);

  outInfo->Set(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::MAXIMUM_NUMBER_OF_PIECES(),
               -1);

where NNN is the output port number. This goes in RequestInformation().

Best,
-berk

I get this error when I select the 2nd output as displayable, although it contains 4 cells and 10 points, so it is not empty.
What does it mean?

Ok, my problem with the current VTK Edge seems to be that this is not
working with paraview 3.6.2. I know some out there have this running.
Could anybody please tell me which subeversion release is running with
3.6.2? Thanks.

That's weird. It am guessing a bug somewhere. Can you post the source code
so that we can take a look?

The best way (which is non-trivial) of doing this is to define new cell
types. If you are willing to spend some time doing this, I can guide you.

Hi

I wan to plot points and data associated with this points . Is there any
way to do it , preferably with VTK legacy format  

Or maybe new format,

Message-ID: <a44d4ae01002040601j15412f4bsc3350d17e923f8e1@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings Everyone,

In preparation for the ParaView 3.8 release we will be branching CVS head
towards the end of February/Early March. Please be aware that if you have
changes that should go out with this release then be sure to commit them
soon. With this in mind I am going to be less tolerant of compile and test
failures as we aim to make the dashboard as green as possible.

Also there are a large number of files that have very poor coverage,
including quite a few that have zero coverage.

http://www.cdash.org/CDash/viewCoverage.php?buildid=531124

If you are registered and log into CDash you can see a column of
CDash guesstimated authors as well. If you are the main author of any of
these files I would appreciate it if you would add a test or two to improve
the coverage of your class to at least 60%. I will also be sending out
emails to individual authors to keep this going.

I appreciate your cooperation in these efforts.

Thanks!

You can apply the "Plot Data" filter and then select the point/cell
array to plot in either Bar Chart View or the XY Plot VIew.

Thanks for the response ,

It is not exactly what I meant   ,

I have a data set  with points located on 3d space  ,  I know the
location of the points    and each point has scalar and vector
properties (volume, area , velocity , force , etc ) .  which I would
like to visualize in normal mode

It is like drawing cell properties but in my case I cant  (make no
sense)  draw a grid

Orlando !

You can write a CSV (comma separated values) file with the point
coordinates and associated data. Then use "Table To Points" filter to
render the points in 3D. Is that what you are looking for?

I have recompiled with debugging symbols and attached a backtrace from the first pvserver process. The crash is in Mesa, and happens both with the stock Mesa 6.5 from CentOS and after upgrading to the 
latest stable version from source (7.6.1). The relevant piece of mesa code appears to be the jmp call below (Mesa 7.6.1):

#elif defined(PTHREADS)
        pushq   %rdi
        call    _x86_64_get_dispatch at PLT
        popq    %rdi
        movq    2344(%rax), %r11
        jmp     *%r11
#else

I have absolutely no clue what this bit of code does, or why it fails here (especially only when more than 4 processes are running). I have tried using both 8 processes on the same node and 8 processes on 
different nodes. This looks very similar to these threads:
http://markmail.org/thread/owglrjmzkqlfmuhm
and
http://markmail.org/message/5eekpxkkh5iput2w

Somehow, I get the feeling this is not going to be easy... :)

 It's a very small file (10700 cells), in this case the "airFoil2D"  OpenFOAM tutorial file after conversion. It loads fine with exactly the same setup using 4 processes.

Hi,

I have a 3D line element system with nodal and cell values. Is it possible to  
visualize the nodal or cell data by displaying the single lines with 
different thicknesses?
I tried the glyph filter with cylinders but this does not work as I cannot 
assign variing cylinder lengths. My lines are of different length.

Thanks in advance.

Best regards,

Hi John,

I looked at the dataset. It is indeed a bug. It is not clear to me where the
bug is though. Despite having those checkboxes, the reader is not producing
those arrays. You can verify this by looking at the data information under
the Information tab of the object inspector. This may be a bug in the reader
or a bug in the file itself (i.e. non-compliance to the format). Did you
generate this data?

Just a hunch but is there any chance you can try another version of OpenMPI?
Hopefully a newer version?

Message-ID: <97d9bd671002041059y4a44a79od75037b893d1caff@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I am trying to get client- server working where the client submits jobs via
MOAB to the cluster.  In order to do this, I have so far been able to do the
following

1)Connect from client to server in rc and just run on the cluster (this was
a test and no MOAB) was used
2)SSH into viz cluster, start PV client in the login node, generate a MOAB
script on the fly (basically this takes the number of nodes the user wants
through the standard PV xml input box), generates the moab script and
submits

Our system is where, only login nodes can see the compute nodes - in order
to run in client-server mode, where the client is workstation and server is
the viz cluster, PV wiki suggests the port forwarding utility.

I am no expert on this type of stuff, but I can see how this would work -
the question is if you have multiple users connecting at the same time,
obviously you can't forward everything into 11111 for example.

We have thought of doing this via some sort of a look up table on the server
side where portfwd utility looks up what is available and then forwards it
on.

Is there a better solution than this?  Is anyone using the portfwd utility
in a production system where multiple users login at the same time to run
PV?  If so, how did you get this to work?

Best wishes,
Rakesh

Sorry, already tried that :) First attempt was with 1.3.2, as supplied by 
CentOS 5.4, and now all nodes are using 1.4.1.

Hi Rakesh,

If you use reverse connections, the compute nodes only need to be able to 
connect to outside machines (i.e. the workstations). Turning on NAT on a 
gateway machine, i.e. the frontend, should be sufficient for that, and no port 
forwarding is needed. This works on a standard Rocks setup, which enables the 
frontend as gateway by default.

Cheers,

Bart

Hi,

I have used ssh for this on such systems. As long as the batch system 
gives you exclusive use of the set of compute nodes(usually the case), 
you shouldn't have to worry about ports being used by others because the 
tunnel is through your ssh connection. It's not automated though. Here 
is how I do it:

I use two terminals on my workstation, in the following denoted by t1$ 
and t2$, say fe is the front end on your cluster. In the first terminal:

    t1$ ssh fe
    t1$ qsub -I -V -l select=XX -l walltime=XX:XX:XX


XX is replaced by your values. The job starts and you're automatically 
ssh'd into some compute node, which we'll say has hostname NODE. In the 
second terminal:

    t2$ ssh fe
    t2$ ~C<enter>
    -L ZZZZZ:NODE:YYYYY


The ~C bit is an escape sequence that sets up the port forward. ZZZZZ is 
a port number on your workstation. YYYYY is a port number on the server 
that is not blocked by the clusters internal firewall (see your sys 
admin). Now back to terminal one, and your waiting compute node:

    t1$ module load PV3-modulefile
    t1$ mpiexec pvserver --server-port=YYYYY


The module is what sets up the ld library path and paths for your 
ParaView server install (see your sys admin). now paraview is running on 
the cluster. You start the ParaView client locally and connect over port 
ZZZZZ on localhost.


That's what I do, if you come up with some automated script though that 
would be killer.

What about Valgrind? Any chance you can start one of the processes such that
you can run it in Valgrind?

I am developing a custom panel for a vtkFilter that I wrote. As part  
of the GUI, I need to load up a jpg image to use as an icon in the  
GUI. I put an entry into the .qrc file where the entry for the .ui  
file is located but when I load the panel the image does not show up.  
I don't get any type of error either so I am not really sure where to  
start hunting this down.

Anyone have any ideas?

Message-ID: <52282.94.192.82.186.1265323773.squirrel@webmail.bris.ac.uk>

Hi
Im looking at using paraview to visualise the 3 eigenvectors and the 3
eigenvalues of a tensor using 3 vector lines at each point in my
structured grid aranged in a similar manner to axis lines. The three
vector lines are unit vectors which give the direction and are accompanied
by 3 magnitudes to give the length. I was wondering how to write a VTK
file for this and how I can use paraview to visualise 3 vectors at each
point.
Thanks Jacob Cook

Jacob,

Have a look at http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/User_Created_Plugins and
download the Superquadric Tensor Glyph Filter. The zip file contains two
sample files with tensors (VTK legacy format). If you compile ParaView
from source, you'll be able to compile the plugin as well which allows
to visualise tensors using rectangular glyphs, ellipsoidal glyphs,
cylindrical glyphs and, as a generalisation, superquadric glyphs with
ParaView.

Sven

I think the technique Burlen described takes advantages of the interactive
queues.

Here is another type of situation that uses the batch queue instead- user
opens paraview on their workstation, submits a job to the cluster, then
waits for the pvserver job to start and reverse connect to the client.

You mentioned generating MOAB job scripts on the fly through a pv xml input
dialog.  All you would need to do would be add some extra code to your job
script template.  The extra code would generate a portfwd config file with a
port chosen by the user.  The user would have to pick a port number other
than 11111, a random port that hopefully is not in use.  When the start
server button is clicked on the client it could run a custom command that
ssh's to a login node, starts portfwd with the custom config file, and
submits the MOAB script.  Now the user just waits to pvserver to connect
back to the login node which is forwarded straight to the workstation.  If
the compute node can't connect to the login node by name (`hostname`) you
can use /sbin/ifconfig to figure out the exact IP.

I can't think of an elegant way to kill portfwd when the session is over,
but you can probably come up with something.  Sorry I can't offer any
specific details.  You might want to read this wiki page too, it describes
such a system in use:

Goodluck!

1) You need to check you are adding the resources:

    QT4_ADD_RESOURCES(RCS_SRCS MyResource.qrc)

Check this by looking at the generated file in the build directory
(qrc_MyResource.cxx).

2) Make sure you are including it in the plugin:

    ADD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN(MyPlugin ....
                    ....
                    SOURCES ... ${RCS_SRCS} ...)

Check this with make VERBOSE=1 to make sure it is being linked in

3) And, if both of the above are correct make sure that you refer to your
resource correctly.

e.g. for foo.jpg in ResourceFile.qrc:

<RCC>
  <qresource prefix="/MyResource">
    <file>foo.jpg</file>
  </qresource>
</RCC>

Use:
    :/MyResource/foo.jpg


Hope that helps!

Regards,
Paul

PS there is something qt documentation that mentions how you may need to
call Q_INIT_RESOURCE if the resource is in a static library:-
http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.6/resources.html

Make sure you are linking this file into your executable

Message-ID: <55c3450a1002050550h55598aa8obed2cce835e78b36@mail.gmail.com>

Hi guys,

Is there a way of applying a transformation (increase the Z scale for
example) to several loaded files without having to change all files
individually?
I made a python script which could be launch from the python shell but
I am looking for something a bit more sexy!
Maybe you have some better ideas. I don't know if I can make it with a
plugin because it need to be apply on all the files loaded
(.pvd,.vtu...)

Any help or ideas are welcome!

Cheers

Tristan

Thanks for the sanity check. I guess something was not getting rebuilt  
as I cleaned the project and rebuilt and now the image is properly  
loaded. Odd.

  Thanks again for taking the time.

Subject: [Paraview] [Ensight Gold format] Crash of temporal data
Message-ID: <224306b01002050729t3473232xe29a89bd36ba71c4@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Everybody!

I am struggling with a small and rather curious issue. I imported data
in Ensight format to paraview. Data describe 20 time steps of a very
simple simulation. I can view the first frame, however upon pressing
Next Frame ParaView crashed and treats me with a Segmentaion Fault
error on my command line.

The problem is curious because of the following observation. When I
start with viewing last frame I can trace the simulation backwards by
pressing "Previous Frame".

I am running OpenSUSE 11.2 with KDE 4.3.1. I am running ParaView 3.7.0.

I can supply you with troublesome files. Alternatively could you
please provide me with some working Ensight files so that I can verify
that my Ensight files are all right.

Many thanks for any comments,
Robert

I ran things in valgrind, but this showed exactly the same crash. I have 
recompiled mesa with TLS, so the PTHREADS block in the ASM code mentioned 
previously is ignored, and now I get a little further (see attached GDB 
trace). The problem appears to be glGetString(GL_VERSION) returning null.

I added extra debug comments in vtkOpenGLExtensionManager.cxx, starting at 
line 496:

--------------
  if(version)
  {
    vtkWarningMacro(<< "GL Version: " << version);
  }
  else
  {
    vtkWarningMacro("GL version was null, IsCurrent is: " << this-
>RenderWindow->IsCurrent());
  }
----------------

The output of this confirms that version is null when running on 8 processes, 
while RenderWindow->IsCurrent() is shown to be true (1).
When running on 4 processes, on the other hand, everything still works and no 
text is generated at all! I would expect to at least see the contents of 
'version' being printed, in that case? Is all this code somehow only becoming 
active when running many processes?

I also tried aborting the extension manager in the same way as when there are 
no extensions. This avoids the crash but shows only a black screen.

I think the error itself is related to the GL context being messed up somehow, 
even though RenderWindow->IsCurrent() appears to think it is OK. Is anyone 
using OSMesa on many processes? If so, could you please share the exact 
version info and configuration options?

Finally, I also tested using on-screen rendering. This works fine, I tested up 
to 16 processes on the head node alone (not wanting to configure the whole 
cluster with X yet). Unfortunately, rendering became slower and slower as I 
increased the number of processes. Is launching 8 on-screen rendering 
processes on the same node futile, even if there are 8 CPU cores? Would OSMesa 
perform any better in this use case?

Cheers,

Bart

In ParaView 3.6.2 you can assign your python script to a "macro" which can appear as both a menu entry and a toolbar button.  Is that sexy enough?

Hi guys,

Is there a way of applying a transformation (increase the Z scale for
example) to several loaded files without having to change all files
individually?
I made a python script which could be launch from the python shell but
I am looking for something a bit more sexy!
Maybe you have some better ideas. I don't know if I can make it with a
plugin because it need to be apply on all the files loaded
(.pvd,.vtu...)

Any help or ideas are welcome!

Cheers

   A similar problem (I am not sure if it is just what you reported herein)
was reported not long ago and was then fixed. Is your PV up to date?

   If possible, please send me your files.

Subject: [Paraview] Best format for time dependent datasets (polygonal mesh)
	with constant topology
Message-ID: <ACC3A02DECEA4F949C4500189575A413@LIMPCMGC>

I am planning to use Paraview to post-process results from my in-house
developed simulation software. 

After reading the ?Paraview Guide?, the ?File Formats for VTK? and googling
data formats, I still find very difficult to select the data format (among
those supported by Paraview) which is more appropriate to my needs:

- Type of dataset: polygonal mesh. 
- Time dependent. Topology is constant over time, but geometry (point
coordinates) and attributes are not. 
- Dataset size: 1e5 points, 1e5 lines, 1e5 2D polygons, 2-4 attributes per
line and polygon, 100-500 time steps.

Of course, I would like to avoid writing the same (constant) topology for
each time step. 
And it would be great if the topology could be stored in a separate file
from the rest of the dataset (I often run several simulations for the same
topology).

I would appreciate any help to select the right data format for this kind of
dataset.

Best regards,
Manuel

Hi,

Thanks for your replies - I think the plan is to have two queues in our new
machine (parallel and interactive). What Pat described here is what we have
been thinking about, just thought there must be a more elegant solution than
this - for example, in VisIt you don't have to include the portfwd bit.
Perhaps some thing to consider for future PV releases?  I assume these kind
of issues are common in production platforms?

Another point to consider is, from a procurement point of view, people don't
really care about visualization, all they want is more TeraFlops etc and
then expect the visualization to be fitted into the system (ie : no separate
network between login and compute, only logins will see the file systems
etc)

I did set it up to do client-server in reverse, some direct responses to
what is suggested below.

You mentioned generating MOAB job scripts on the fly through a pv xml input

> Yes - agreed, only problem is sys admin folks are very funny about opening
several ports - I think I have to come up with some clever way to make them
think, they are not opening many ports !  We thought we could keep a log of
what is available and what is used, so each time it connects it can work out
which ones to use (this may avoid the use of random port number that is
"hopefully" not in use)

portfwd job at the end when MOAB scripts finishes.  The portfwd will be
started at the user level - so the user should be able to kill their own
jobs as part of the script (well that would be the theory!)

When I get something to work, I will post some thing here on how I did
it....

If admins are concerned about opening ports than maybe you should use ssh
tunnels instead of portfwd.  I like to recommend portfwd because I find it
simpler to use, but usually an ssh tunnel can work just as well.  And you
don't have to worry about killing portfwd when your done.  If you can get a
ssh tunnel to work then should be able to setup the tunnel in your custom
command when starting the server.

Just a thought: Have you tried an entirely clean rebuild? Someone got
an error similar to this before and it went away after a rebuild.

Subject: [Paraview] Best format for time dependent datasets (polygonal
 mesh)	with constant topology
In-Reply-To: <ACC3A02DECEA4F949C4500189575A413@LIMPCMGC>

Manuel,

A easy data format for your application would be the EnSight binary format:

1) The mesh topology/geometry is stored in a seperate file. (I have seen 
remarks that it can be a one-time write, however, I write topology and 
coordinates every time step but "direct" the reader to only read the 
coordinates -- my mesh distorts with time during execution.)

2) It provides for scalar, vector, and 2nd-order tensor data at each 
note and in each cell.

3) It stores each point/cell variable vs time in separate files.

4) The association between variable name and the data (in its file) 
takes place in a *case file, see the attached example. (A simple trick: 
*.case files are ASCII text and easily edited. After two runs, one can 
write a third *.case file (assuming the geometry files and time stepping 
is identical) and reference two files with two, new variable names like 
Velocity-Reference and Velocity-Trial-Algorithm#1 and their respective 
data files. A delta-Vel difference can be done with ParaView's 
Calculator filter.)

5) File Format: http://www2.ensight.com/90_manuals/90-UserManual.pdf 
Chapter 11

If you want to see a Fortran-90 routine that writes EnSight, let me know.

I was thinking about this. Is it not possible to run a script that starts
the ParaView server, figures out where the first node is and then sets up an
ssh tunnel to that node through the login node?

I wasn't able to do that on the last cluster I worked on because it was not
possible to ssh to a compute node.

Usually I just set up a reverse tunnel from the login node to my work
machine.  The server starts up on the compute nodes and does a reverse
connection to the login node which then travels through the tunnel to my
work machine.  All you need to know is the IP of the login node.  Often a
login node has 2 different IPs, one is for the network interface to the
outside, and the other is a network interface for communicating with compute
nodes.

The only thing about reverse connection is that the user then has to 
open a port on the local firewall. It's not always possible.

It relies on a fast queue. Actually I use this technique for the 
production/normal/long queues, on Pliedes (NASA NAS), Spur, and Ranger 
(TACC). So far with a few exceptions I have been able to get as many 
nodes as I want in a matter of seconds or few minutes. A large PV job 
(1E2 nodes) is a drop in the bucket for most of these systems so they 
seem to get scheduled quickly.

The interactive job (qsub -I) lets you get the hostname of the node and 
set up the tunnel before you start paraview. You have to set the tunnel 
up first then start PV, because once PV starts and is listening on a 
port ssh refuses to use that port in the tunnel. I used a two ssh 
sessions the second to create the tunnel because the something about the 
way the batch system logs you into the compute node prevents the tunnel 
from being created inside the job. I don't know its specific to the 
systems I am using or a general fact of life.

Don't know if it would for you, but on the systems mentioned I haven't 
needed to ssh to the compute node, if you have its hostname (interactive 
job will display it), you can set up the tunnel from the front end.

    fe$ ~C<enter>
    -L YYYYY:NODE:ZZZZZ

An additional factor to consider when devising an automated solution for 
PV: In order to login into the front end, in addition to a password we 
are required to enter code from an RSA Secure Id device that NASA sent 
us. no password less login is allowed there. An automated solution would 
hopefully take that scenario into account.

Nope, sorry, keeps happening after a full rebuild (even threw away the CMake 
cache). One thing I forgot to mention in my last mail is that 
glGetString(GL_EXTENSIONS) is NULL as well. It seems that somehow OSMesa and 
or ParaView think there is a valid context, but it's not really there.

I even tried applying this mesa patch that later got reverted:
http://cgit.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/commit/?id=17090cf3efb0db8fa01b502a9c0df27cbd1a67da

The existence of that patch seems to at least suggest that accessing rendering 
contexts in parallel might cause problems on certain mesa configs. Getting the 
exact same OSMesa setup as someone who has this working on many processors 
could help to confirm this.

Cheers,

A possibility is that when run on the compute nodes open gl libraries 
other than the one you expect are used. That can cause a strange crash. 
I have seen it before. If you're not doing it, prepend your mesa path to 
LD_LIBRARY_PATH before you launch pvserver.

I always used OSMesa configured with mesa configs. eg. "make linux", 
installed in my home directory, as long as I set LD_LIBRARY_PATH I never 
have had any troubles.

Hope it helps

Also, make sure you PV configuration uses the opengl and osmesa from 
your build. To make it easy I always run ccmake the first time with 
these options on the command line:

-DVTK_OPENGL_HAS_OSMESA=ON 
-DOPENGL_INCLUDE_DIR=/u/burlen/apps/Mesa-7.5.1-Intel/include 
-DOPENGL_gl_LIBRARY=/u/burlen/apps/Mesa-7.5.1-Intel/lib64/libGL.so 
-DOPENGL_glu_LIBRARY=/u/burlen/apps/Mesa-7.5.1-Intel/lib64/libGLU.so 
-DOPENGL_xmesa_INCLUDE_DIR=/u/burlen/apps/Mesa-7.5.1-Intel/include 
-DOSMESA_INCLUDE_DIR=/u/burlen/apps/Mesa-7.5.1-Intel/include 
-DOSMESA_LIBRARY=/u/burlen/apps/Mesa-7.5.1-Intel/lib64/libOSMesa.so

that mitigates some of the configuration pain.

Hey, Berk,

I will need to dig around for them, but I have a few scripts that I  
have used to do this.  Here is the basics of how they work.

We have a scheduled resource that requires OTP.  I have a script that  
I run on my local host, which will first prompt me for how many nodes  
and how many minutes that I want to run my job.  It then prompts me  
for OTP and ssh's to the login node of the resource.  There it runs a  
script that submits a job to the scheduler to run a wrapper script  
around pvserver.  This pvserver wrapper script figures out which node  
is the head node of the job.  This is returned to the original script  
on my local host.  The original script then uses this information to  
set up an ssh tunnel from the local host through the login node to the  
head node where pvserver is listening (prompting for OTP again.)    I  
can then connect my paraview client to the pvserver through the tunnel.

So, I run this local script, get prompted for OTP twice (once for  
launching pvserver, and again to establish the ssh tunnel) and then  
connect paraview client to pvserver.  There are some things that may  
be resource/scheduler specific, but if folks are interested I can dig  
up these scripts and share them.

joe.

maybe I shouldn't have opened my mouth, mixing libraries doesn't 
necessarily explain the more than 4 procs thing... unless when you run 
with 4 procs they are being scheduled to the same node, and running with 
more causes another node to come into the mix.

How are process being assigned to nodes?

Hi,

Thanks for the suggestions, but unfortunately I haven't gotten to the point of 
running on nodes yet. Everything runs on the head node, which uses custom mesa 
and OSMesa RPMs built from the 7.6.1 Mesa source code installed to /usr.

Are you using the stock 7.5.1 source code of Mesa? I have only tried 6.5.1 
(CentOS 5.4 flavor) and 7.6.1 so far. Could you also post the compiler flags and 
configure options you use for mesa? Maybe if I mirror your settings, it will 
work here as well.

Cheers,

Yes, I was but I recently updated to Mesa 7.7.

There are two ways to build Mesa. The autotools way and the old way. By 
autotools way I mean "./configure && make && make install", and by old 
way I mean the canned configurations that come with mesa. I have always 
used the old way with success. Do a fresh untar of mesa cd in and type 
make. You'll see a list of available configurations. I have used both 
"linux" and "linux-x86-64" with success. You can take a look at the 
files with these names in the configs directory to see what flags are 
being used. To install you'll have to set the INSTALL_DIR variable in 
configs/default.

> Maybe if I mirror your settings, it will 
> work here as well.
if this is really an interaction with OpenMPI, rebuilding osmesa may not 
make a bit of difference. In that case you might want to try mpich2, 
just to see what happens. And if you do I'd suggest you build it yourself.

With ParaView and all of its external dependencies, such as MPI and 
OSMesa, I would recommend against system wide installs (eg /usr) . Build 
them yourself and install them in a non-standard location (has to be 
mounted on all nodes), either /opt/APPNAME or 
/home/YOURNAME/apps/APPNAME or something like that, and prior to 
building or running ParaView  explicitly prepend these locations to 
LD_LIBRARY_PATH. The Modules program makes this type of thing very 
convenient. This helps CMake find what you want and you're always 
absolutely sure that you have the right libraries at run time, and you 
can quickly swap them in and out supporting multiple configurations.

Take this last bit of advise with a grain of salt, as I don't want to 
sidetrack you from the real issue. If you're not installing PV and just 
running it from the build dir, by default he uses RPATH, so run time 
library  issues won't come up.

>>> The only thing about reverse connection is that the user then has to
open a port on the local firewall. It's not always possible.

Maybe I'm misunderstanding what you mean by local firewall, but usually as
long as you can ssh from your workstation to the login node you can use a
reverse ssh tunnel.  From your workstation:

ssh -R 11111:localhost:33333 remote_login_node_hostname

Now any connection to port 11111 on the login node is forwarded through the
ssh connection to your workstation's port 33333 (your workstation makes a
new connection to localhost:33333 and forwards the traffic)

Hi Pat,

My bad. I was looking at the PV wiki, and thought you were talking about 
doing this without an ssh tunnel and using only port forward and 
paraview's --reverse-connection option . Now that I am reading your 
hpc.mil post I see what you mean :)

Ah, many thanks for this, got it working from the build dir by compiling mesa 
7.7 with target linux-x86-64. I think in retrospect openmpi has nothing to do 
with it, and this was probably a mesa issue all along, either due to a bug in 
the versions I tried, or because I used the autotools build method.

Thanks to all who helped tracking this down!

Subject: [Paraview] vtkJPEGReader as Plugin - Loading Volumes
Message-ID: <4B6DE485.1010308@rwth-aachen.de>

Hi there!

I'm having trouble getting the vtkJPEGReader to work properly as plugin. 
Specifically I don't know how to set up the approriate .xml file. It 
works with command="SetFileName" perfectly, but that way I am getting 
the first slice only. I see that one should use SetFilePrefix and/or 
SetFilePattern, but how can I make Paraview pass the appropriate 
parameters to the plugin??

This is how my .xml looks like, it's just a guess, I really don't know 
better:

<ServerManagerConfiguration>
  <ProxyGroup name="sources">
   <SourceProxy name="JPEGImageReader"
                class="vtkJPEGReader"
                label="JPEG reader">
     <Documentation
       short_help="Read a JPEG file."
       long_help="Read a JPEG file into an image data.">
       The JPEG image reader reads JPG files, and the output is a 
uniform rectilinear (image/volume) dataset. The default file extension 
is .jpg.
     </Documentation>
    #will become e.g. /home/christian/jpegs
     <StringVectorProperty
        name="Files"
        animateable="0"
        command="SetFilePrefix"
        number_of_elements="1">
        <FileListDomain name="files"/>
        <Documentation>
          This property specifies the File Prefix for the JPEG reader.
        </Documentation>
        <Hints>
          <UseDirectoryName />
        </Hints>
     </StringVectorProperty>
     #file pattern
     <StringVectorProperty
       name="Pattern"
       animateable="0"
       command="SetFilePattern"
       number_of_elements="1"
       default_value="/*.jpg">
     </StringVectorProperty>
   <!-- End JPEGImageReader -->
   </SourceProxy>
  </ProxyGroup>
</ServerManagerConfiguration>

With that, I get

Unable to open file /home/christian/jpges.0


when trying to open a set of jpges...

Does anyone have any idea? I'd also like to know where there is 
documentation on all these markups like what you can put in <Hint>, etc..


Best regards,
Christian

got resolved at all!). I feel very happy to collaborate with so many awesome

Subject: [Paraview] connectiong to pvserver from an external python shell
Message-ID: <1265545642.19848.9.camel@greenstar>

I am trying to connect to pvserver from an external ipython console. 
After 
from paraview.simple import * 
i tried with 
Connect('bluestar') 
but this gives me the error: 

ERROR: In /var/tmp/portage/sci-visualization/paraview-3.6.2/work/ParaView3/VTK/Common/vtkClientSocket.cxx, line 54
vtkClientSocket (0x494dc10): Failed to connect to server bluestar:11111

vtkProcessModuleConnectionManager (0x388b290): Connect failed.  Retrying for 16.9255 more seconds.
I started the pvserver by hand launching from shell the pvserver command.
I am interested in manipulating my object from an external python console and view it in a Paraview client (that correctly connects to pvserver using the gui).
Is this the best way to do that? Other possibilities?
I was wondering if it would possible to write new plugins using python and embedding into the paraview-client interface (with a little GUI and so on..). 
Is this possible?

sorry for my english
hope someone can understand
thank you!

ParaView's server can not handle and will not accept connections from more
than one client at a time.

Utkarsh has been working on architectural changes to allow that, but they
will not be ready until after 3.8 to the best of my knowledge.

The problem seems to be that you are using the Pattern incorrectly. It
should be of the form: "%s/image%d.jpg" where %s gets replaced by the
directory while %d gets replaced by the slice number.

Dear All,

I'm executing the filter vtkPlotEdges. I pass in a vtkPolyData object and
receive a vtkMultiBlockDataSet object as output. My output data object is
also of type vtkMultiBlockDataSet, so I'm trying to perform a DeepCopy of
the temp object, but I'm receiving a segmentation fault. Can someone point
out what I'm missing here?

{

vtkMultiBlockDataSet *output = vtkMultiBlockDataSet::SafeDownCast(
outInfo->Get(vtkDataObject::DATA_OBJECT()) );

//polydata is a pointer to a populated vtkPolyData object.

std::cout << "Executing vtkPlotEdges..." << std::endl;
vtkPlotEdges* pe = vtkPlotEdges::New();
pe->SetInput(outputPoly);
pe->Update();

output->DeepCopy(pe->GetOutput());

pe->Delete();

}


Cheers,

Ok, it appears the code I posted works if I don't call pe->Delete(). I was
hoping the DeepCopy would allow me to then free up this memory. Maybe
someone could clear this up for me?

I am having troubles with a reader plugin which works well under 3.6.2
but is missing some DataInformation under the CVS version. Specifically,
my reader produces a hierarchy of multi-blocks, so some data fields are
only stored on some datasets, and PV3.6.2 correctly associates them and
displays them as "partial".

in PV3.6.2, printing my reader.GetDataInformation().DataInformation,
each *and all* fields is displayed, and correctly marked with "IsPartial".

in PV3.7, the "partial" fields are missing, although they are read and
stuffed in memory, and consequently, I cannot used them in Display
Properties.

Did I miss some new developments which causes this side-effect?

Message-ID: <5f395e811002080615x3fc3d00bq2616b1ac9b50ba@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
I use paraview version 3.7. I built Paraview on a Red Hat 4.5 system, and I
use this  binaries on another system which is identical (with the same OS
and same hardware).

If I work on the second system, I have problem with the function "seve
screenshot" :
I save a screen of a 3D vue in png format. When I displayed the png
file, colour
are dark, the color legend numbers are written backwards, and the displayed
result has been symmetry along the xy plane.
But I don't have any problem if  I work on the system where I built
paraview.

Do you have an idea of what happens?

regards,
Didier

I'm not sure why you are getting the error that you are, but I would recommend using a ShallowCopy instead of a DeepCopy.

The problem may be when you set the input of pe to outputPoly.  I don't know where that object came from, but if it is part of either the input or output of your filter, you should not set it directly as the input to an internal filter.  Doing so will screw up the pipeline connections already established for your filter and then wreck havoc on the executive because it will not expect the pipeline connections to change while your filter is executing.  You should create a new object to use as the input and shallow copy the data into that new object.

Dear All,

I'm executing the filter vtkPlotEdges. I pass in a vtkPolyData object and
receive a vtkMultiBlockDataSet object as output. My output data object is
also of type vtkMultiBlockDataSet, so I'm trying to perform a DeepCopy of
the temp object, but I'm receiving a segmentation fault. Can someone point
out what I'm missing here?

{

vtkMultiBlockDataSet *output = vtkMultiBlockDataSet::SafeDownCast(
outInfo->Get(vtkDataObject::DATA_OBJECT()) );

//polydata is a pointer to a populated vtkPolyData object.

std::cout << "Executing vtkPlotEdges..." << std::endl;
vtkPlotEdges* pe = vtkPlotEdges::New();
pe->SetInput(outputPoly);
pe->Update();

output->DeepCopy(pe->GetOutput());

pe->Delete();

}

I have done some tidying up on the filter since this morning and I found the
source of my problem was as you say, related to using the input object in
another filter. When I initially defined outputPoly I had actually named it
just output and called my vtkMultiBlockDataSet object outputMB. So, 'output'
object was being passed in vtkPlotEdges as input and, as you say, this was
the issue. When I changed it around (output = vtkMultiBlockDataSet object),
everything worked nicely and ShallowCopy and Delete work fine. 
 
Silly error to make, really, but thanks for explaining why this is an issue.

Both ways will work for me in most cases, i.e. a "forward" connection 
with ssh -L or a reverse connection with ssh -R.

However, I find that the reverse method is more scriptable.  You can set 
up a .pvsc file that the client can load and will call ssh with the 
appropriate options and commands for the remote host, all from the GUI. 
  The client will simply wait for the reverse connection from the 
server, whether it takes 5 seconds or 5 hours for the server to get 
through the batch queue.

Using the forward connection method, if the server isn't started soon 
enough, the client will attempt to connect and then fail.  I've always 
had to log in separately, wait for the server to start running, then 
tell my client to connect.

Message-ID: <2b35b5e91002081003g1b538db9v74acd77591398255@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, ppl.

I'm working with paraview stereo projections and I learned who to compile to
work with Red Blue and Crystal Eyes Stereo modes in diferent compilations.

Now I want to merge both ways in the same program that, depending on how I
start paraview, it runs with diferent stereo modes.

For example:
paraview --stereo //starts it in red blue mode.
paraview --stereo crystal_eyes //starts it in crystal eyes mode.

to do this, I'm looking for the main function of the program to get its argc
and argv parameters, but I'm afraid I can't find it. The sub-project named
paraview seems to have nothing to do with the executable file.

Can anyone give me a help?

So to be sure about what you're saying: Your .pvsc script ssh's to the 
front end and submits a batch job which when it's scheduled , your batch 
script creates a -R style tunnel and starts pvserver using PV reverse 
connection. ? or are you using portfwd or a second ssh session to 
establish the tunnel ?

If you're doing this all from your .pvsc script without a second ssh 
session and/or portfwd that's awesome! I haven't been able to script 
this, something about the batch system prevents the tunnel created 
within the batch job's ssh session from working. I don't know if that's 
particular to this system or a  general fact of life about batch systems.

Question: How are you creating the tunnel in your batch script?

What version of ParaView are you using? ParaView from CVS head has
--stereo-type command line option that can be used to choose the type
of stereo.

FYI, --stereo-type is not supported with 3.6.2.

Here's the output from paraview --help:

...
 --stereo-type=opt      Specify the stereo type. This valid only when
--stereo is specified. Possible values are "Crystal Eyes", "Red-Blue",
"Interlaced", "Dresden", "Anaglyph", "Checkerboard"
...

What's the relationship between this feature and In-situ/co-processing?

If possible, it would be nice to follow progress/status of these 
much-waited features on the developer blog :)

Not quite- the pvsc calls ssh with both the tunnel options and the 
commands to submit the batch job.  You don't even need a pvsc; it just 
makes the interface fancier.  As long as you or PV executes something 
like this from your machine:
ssh -R XXXX:localhost:YYYY remote_machine submit_my_job.sh

This means that port XXXX on remote_machine will be the port to which 
the server must connect.  Port YYYY (e.g., 11111) on your client machine 
is the one on which PV listens.  You'd have to tell the server (in the 
batch submission script, for example) the name of the node and port XXXX 
to which to connect.

One caveat that might be causing you problems, port forwarding (and 
"gateway ports" if the server is running on a different node than the 
login node) must be enabled in the remote_machine's sshd_config.  If 
not, no ssh tunnels will work at all (see: man ssh and man sshd_config). 
  That's something that an administrator would need to set up for you.

Nice, thanks for the clarification. I am guessing that your example 
should probably be the recommended approach rather than the portfwd 
method suggested on the PV wiki. :) I took the initiative to add it to 
the Wiki. KW let me know if this is not the case!

    http://paraview.org/Wiki/Reverse_connection_and_port_forwarding#Reverse_connection_over_an_ssh_tunnel

Would you mind taking a look to be sure I didn't miss anything or bollix 
it up?

The sshd config options you mentioned may be why your method doesn't 
work on the Pleiades system, either that or there is a firewall between 
the front ends and compute nodes. In either case I doubt the NAS sys 
admins are going to reconfigure for me :) So at least for now I'm stuck 
with the two hop ssh tunnels and interactive batch jobs. if there were 
someway to script the ssh tunnel in my batch script I would be golden...

By the way I put the details of the two hop ssh tunnel on the wiki as 
well, and a link to Pat's hpc.mil notes. I don't dare try to summarize 
them since I've never used portfwd and it refuses to compile both on my 
workstation and the cluster.

Hopefully putting these notes on the Wiki will save future ParaView 
users some time and headaches.

Hello,

thanks for the quick response!
The one thing I am missing is where in your sprintf example 
"this->FilePrefix" and "this->SliceNumber" comes from. In Paraview I get 
an OpenFile Dialog which probably comes up because the plugin is defined 
as a source. Maybe it is because there is an <FileListDomain> markup, 
though.
When I then choose a file (actually I can select "image-..", for the 
whole series) this is internally passed as the parameter to the 
"SetFilePattern" Command in the JPEGReader Plugin (ist that so?). This 
seems to be what I set up in the appropriate .xml file.
I do have to make sure that when this function is called the actual 
FilePattern is passed that contains the image prefix. But editing the 
.xml file I have no clue how to reference the filename which is of 
course variable. (This would be the "this->FilePrefix" in your example) 
and mix it up with these %s and %d (where I don't know how Paraview 
fills them). Put together, I am somewhat lost.

Best regars,
Christian

I'll see what I can do :-) Utkarsh, we have homework.

We are making good progress on the co-processing project. In fact, some of
the code is already in the development version. I guess we need communicate
better...

Collaboration is a newer project. We are making some progress but I wouldn't
expect it to make into a release in less than 6 months - 1 year.

Actually I didn't write the notes at the hpc.mil link.

Here is something- and maybe this is the problem that Sean refers to- in
some cases, when I have set up a reverse ssh tunnel from login node to
workstation (command executed from workstation) then the forward does not
work when the compute node connects to the login node.  However, if I have
the compute node connect to the login node on port 33333, then use portfwd
to forward that to localhost:11111, where the ssh tunnel is listening on
port 11111, it works like a charm.  The portfwd tricks it into thinking the
connection is coming from localhost and allow the ssh tunnel to work.  Hope
that made a little sense...

Hey just checked out the wiki page, nice!  One question, wouldn't this
command hang up and close the tunnel after submitting the job?

   ssh -R XXXX:localhost:YYYY remote_machine submit_my_job.sh

I am curious to hear what Sean has to say.

But, say the batch system returns right away after the job is submitted, 
I think we can doctor the command so that it will live for a while 
longer, what about something like this:

    ssh -R XXXX:localhost:YYYY remote_machine "submit_my_job.sh && sleep
    100d"

Subject: [Paraview] Tecplot Reader issue
Message-ID: <F2CACE6ED84B440F87383D579F582611@win.ara>


Dear All,

I've been trying to read in a Tecplot ASCII file containing data of type
FELINESEG, but the ParaView reader doesn't seem to recognise it. It reads
fine into Tecplot itself. The header I'm using is:

TITLE = "temp"
VARIABLES = "X", "Y", "Z" "cp"
ZONE T="CUT1", DATAPACKING=POINT, NODES=2, ELEMENTS=1, ZONETYPE=FELINESEG
0.0 0.0 0.0 0.5
1.0 0.0 0.0 1.0
1 2

This is an example, but it should read in fine. The Tecplot reader I'm using
is from a November/December CVS snapshot, so I could be using an out-of-date
version. It would be useful if someone could confirm whether this problem
still exists in newer releases.

Thanks in advance.

Cheers,

Adriano

Hello,

I'm working on isogeometrical analysis ( i.e. FEM methods using  
BSpline and NURBS for the elements of the geometry and the functions  
representation)...is Paraview capable to visualize this kind of  
elements (BSpline and/or NURBS) or I'm forced to discretize my  
elements/solutions using linear/quadratic 2D/3D elements?

Thank you very much

You will have to discretize them I am afraid. It would be awesome if
VTK/ParaView directly supported BSplines and NURBS as data structures...

Are there plans to include this functionality? It would certainly open up
new avenues for ParaView with regards to CFD pre-processing.

You will have to discretize them I am afraid. It would be awesome if
VTK/ParaView directly supported BSplines and NURBS as data structures...

Maybe it has to do with your graphics drivers. Try going to Edit
|Settings dialog, then on the "Render View"  page, uncheck "Use
offscreen rendering for screenshots". Does that help?

Most batch systems have an option to wait until the job is finished 
before the submit command returns.  I know PBS uses "-W block=true" and 
that SGE and LSF have similar options (but I don't recall the precise 
flags).

If your batch system doesn't provide that, I'd recommend adding some 
shell scripting to loop through checking the queue for job completion 
and not return until it's done.  The sleep thing would work, but 
wouldn't exit when the server finishes, leaving the ssh tunnels (and 
other things like portfwd if you put them in your scripts) lying around.

Incidentally, this brings up an interesting point about ParaView with 
client/server.  It doesn't try to clean up it's child processes, AFAIK. 
  For example, if you set up this ssh tunnel inside the ParaView GUI 
(e.g., using a command instead of a manual connection), and you cancel 
the connection, it will leave the ssh running.  You have to track down 
the ssh process and kill it yourself.  It's minor thing, but it can also 
prevent future connections if you don't realize there's a zombie ssh 
that kept your ports open.

Subject: [Paraview] Relatively complex Paraview state for export testing
Message-ID: <4B71C1EF.3000500@googlemail.com>

Hi,

    I am evaluating the export capability of Paraview 3.6.2 i.e. POV, 
VRML, X3D and X3DB

    Does any have publicly available Paraview state file (if necessary 
accompanying data sets) which are relatively complex so that I can 
evaluate the export coverage.

Message-ID: <45d654b1002091226j806b4e3xc3ca7f937e4d249d@mail.gmail.com>

Hi folks,

We are planning on removing the Linux and Mac binaries for ParaView 3.0 to
3.4 from our web site. These binaries are all compiled with MPEG4 support.
The MPEG-LA requires that we keep track of all ParaView downloads and report
to them. This is a tedious task. Given that we switched to using MJPEG and
Ogg/Theora, I would like to cancel our agreement with MPEG-LA. Unless anyone
has a strong objection, we will remove the binaries from the ParaView web
site when we release 3.8. ParaView 3.6 and 3.8 will remain. Please let me
know if this is an issue.

Message-ID: <45d654b1002091228y2fb08507t2fa384883cc112e8@mail.gmail.com>

An Exciting Announcement from Kitware,

* Developer's Training Week will be held May 3 ? 6, 2010, in Albany, NY.

Details
----------

Developer's Training Week will cover our open-source projects including VTK,
ITK, ParaView and CMake. This hands-on course is appropriate for both new
users wishing to quickly gain proficiency and experienced developers
requiring advanced customization skills.

Developer?s Training Week is a great opportunity to meet some of the key
contributors to Kitware?s open-source projects, as well as other users in
the open source community.

As a course attendee, you will receive:
- Books and course notes for the sessions you attend
- Lunch and snacks daily
- A dinner reception on both Monday and Wednesday evening

The week will be divided into full day segments based on course length.
Attendees can customize their experience by selecting specific sessions to
attend based on their individual needs. No prior experience is necessary;
however, attendees are expected to have basic knowledge of C or C++ in order
to fully participate in the interactive exercises.

The cost for registration is $750 for each day segment on or before April
1st and $900 from April 2nd on. We are also offering a discounted full week
registration rate of $2500 on or before April 1st and $3000 from April 2nd
on. Additional student or group discounts are available upon request. Space
is limited, early registration is encouraged.

Kitware courses incorporate both technical presentations and practical
exercises designed to reinforce learning. For an optimal learning experience
each attendee should bring their own laptop computer to the courses.
Approximately two weeks before the courses, attendees will receive detailed
instructions on how to download, install and test all necessary software on
their laptop computer.

Additional information is available by visiting our website:
http://www.kitware.com/products/protraining.html; by emailing
courses at kitware.com; or by calling 518-371-3971.

And i also get a segmentation fault during the rendering

>>>  from  paraview.simple  import  *
paraview version 3.7.0, Date: 2009-11-24
>>>  sph = Sphere()
>>>  elev = Elevation(sph)
>>>  Show(elev)
vtkSphereSource : [ ...........]
vtkElevationFilter : [ ...........]
<paraview.servermanager.GeometryRepresentation object at 0x371b410>
>>>  Render()
vtkPVGeometryFilter : [ ...........]
vtkPVCacheKeeper : [ ...........]
vtkPainterPolyDataMapper : [ ...........]
vtkPainterPolyDataMapper : [ ...........]
<paraview.servermanager.RenderView object at 0x23fbb10>
>>>  dp = GetDisplayProperties(elev)
>>>  dp.Representation  ='Points'
>>>  ai = elev.PointData[1]
>>>  dp.LookupTable  = MakeBlueToRedLT(0,0.5)
>>>  dp.ColorAttributeType  ='POINT_DATA'
>>>  dp.ColorArrayName  ='Elevation'  # color by Elevation
>>>  Render()
vtkPainterPolyDataMapper : [ ...........]
Segmentation fault

I'm using paraview 3.7
Do you have an idea of what happens?

Thanks in advance

Can you try updating to latest CVS and see? I just tried with the CVS
head and couldn't reproduce the issue.

Nice catch. There was a bug in the pqAnimatablePropertiesComboBox.
I've committed a fix to the CVS. Feel free to try it out.

/cvsroot/ParaView3/ParaView3/Qt/Components/pqAnimatablePropertiesComboBox.cxx,v
 <--  Qt/Components/pqAnimatablePropertiesComboBox.cxx
new revision: 1.7; previous revision: 1.6

If you switch repeatedly back and forth between Clip Types (Applying in between), the filter starts getting slower and slower and eventually bogs downs completely. To demonstrate:

Memory use seems to increase on each iteration, but from about 85 to 110 Mb over those steps, so it's not enormous by the end... If you delete the Clip filter and create a new one, it starts over fresh (w/o memory usage drop) and you can repeat the same eventual slowdown.

Mike,

You make a good point about the readability of the dialog.
http://paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=10272

However as far as adding more directories to search by default or to
load plugins from bin directly, you could always use the 'auto-load'
setting to allow the user to mark plugins to load at startup.

Burlen,

That's really cool. I like the the notion of "configuration", but I
have a few questions. What can't configuration merely be a subset of
the state i.e. same as the state xml for that proxy  except with only
the required properties? The main advantage will be that we don't have
another serialization "format" to handle. Plus, you can directly use
the state loading infrastructure to load the configuration without
having to write the configuration loader classes.

Also, one of the reasons for the existence
vtkSMProxyConfigurationManager seems to be the fact that state loading
results in creating of new proxies, but then, that's not necessarily
true. State can be loaded on existing proxies as well -- we do that
for undo-redo. The trick is provide the right vtkSMProxyLocator (or a
subclass) (if I remember correctly).

What do you think?

Yes, you are right, it will be better to use existing sate writing 
mechanism if at all possible. I did attempt it, but hit some obstacles. 
At the time I was unaware about the undo-redo uses state this way, so 
let me take a look at that. I'll get back to you soon.

Thanks. r832 works for me with ParaView 3.6.2.

LIC is quite nice but little dark. Are there ways to increase contrast
(change coler or width of lines?) Thanks.

BastiL:

   You may try using the SurfaceLIC plugin in ParaView, which provides
contrasted LIC image and color map.

Bastil,

Zhanping is referring to CVS head. The SurfaceLIC plugin is now
included by default in CVS ParaView and will be available starting
with ParaView 3.8.

BastiL:

    SurfaceLIC has been integrated to VTK/ParaView. Although there are some
issues with the LIC tests, surfaceLIC plugin can be used (I can run it on
Windows and Linux). Turning on the SurfaceLIC plugin option when CMaking
ParaView and load the plugin to ParaView. Then choose 'SurfaceLIC' (in
contrast with 'wireframe') as the 'representation'.

Ok sounds great. I will give it a try even though I have to leave lovely
3.6.2. By the way - is there a idea about when we will have 3.8? Thanks.

Subject: [Paraview] About running ParaView and Pvserver on a workstation
Message-ID: <dcdb4e1c1002110120h5e4931d8j90aa8bfaf0d992ec@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
if we have a workstation with N processor (on wich we run paraview and
pvserver in two separate shells) must we run pvserver in parallel on a
number of processors strictly smaller than N?
For example, if we have N=4 and in the first shell we run ParaView (with
"paraview"), in the other shell can we use maximum 3 processors (with
"mpirun -np 3 pvserver") or can we use all processors (with "mpirun -np 4
pvserver")?

Thank you very much

The client application is comparatively lightweight, so I think  you can
generally expect better performance for data intensive tasks with N server
processes instead of N-1. Note, you can run more than N if you wish, but you
likely will see performance degrade sharply.

Of course how it scales in practice depends greatly on the problem. What
ParaView scales well at is data intensive problems, where it benefits most
because there is N times the available RAM when it is run on a cluster with
N nodes, an to a lesser degree on having N CPUs to run through the data.

Message-ID: <F4208D58-8285-4EB9-B7DF-049EC4473925@indiana.edu>

I just updated my ParaView from cvs and now see the warning:

 CMake Warning at CMakeLists.txt:95 (MESSAGE):
   Warning: You are using Qt 4.5.3.  Officially supported version is Qt 4.6

So I thought I would dutifully install Qt 4.6.  I attempted to install Qt 4.6 from the Mac binary:
http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/sdk-mac-os-cpp
-->  http://get.qt.nokia.com/qtsdk/qt-sdk-mac-opensource-2010.01.dmg

but once again found out that it didn't provide 64-bit, just 32 and ppc.

I then went to the source:  ftp://ftp.trolltech.com/qt/source/ , but see that there is no OSX source for 4.6, just up to 4.5 (qt-mac-opensource-src-4.5.3).  So I'm just curious, for those of you using OSX 10.6/64-bit, do you have a workaround for getting Qt 4.6 or do you still just use 4.5 for ParaView?

thanks, Randy

if all this sounds familiar - it is, but for Qt 4.5: http://markmail.org/message/x7xdfbx7uhnwfofm?q=list:paraview+osx+qt+4.6+heiland

In 4.6 they ship a unified tar.gz or .zip file for all platforms instead of
one for windows, x11 and mac. Its called qt-everywhere-opensource-src-blah

Subject: [Paraview] Problem using Generate Surface Normals
Message-ID: <C9173A0073294F5F8F30E5826335B00E@win.ara>


Dear All,

I have a custom reader that works fine and loads mesh and data in as I
require. However, when I try to execute 'Generate Surface Normals' on it, I
get the error below. The process I am following is:

-> Read in mesh and data(multi-block data-set, vtkUnstructuredGrid stored in
each block)
-> Extract blocks
-> Extract surface (outputs vtkPolyData)
-> Generate Surface Normals 
-> Error message

ERROR: In /usr/Paraview/ParaView3/VTK/Filtering/vtkExecutive.cxx, line 757
vtkCompositeDataPipeline (0x8135e40): Algorithm vtkTestReader(0x7ecf280)
returned failure for request: vtkInformation (0x1c9cf730)
  Debug: Off
  Modified Time: 369530
  Reference Count: 1
  Registered Events: (none)
  Request: REQUEST_DATA
  FORWARD_DIRECTION: 0
  ALGORITHM_AFTER_FORWARD: 1
  FROM_OUTPUT_PORT: 0

Notably, after this happens the data in the entire pipeline is messed up.
Can someone point me to something that may be missing in my reader?

Best regards,

Adriano

The pathline filter (vtkTemporalPathLineFilter) is intended to operate on a series of particles, say N of them. At timestep t, It generates a point representing each particle and stores it. Then the next time step arrives at t+1 and the pathline filter extends the (polyline) pathline to the new position, it incrementally builds up pathlines as you animate through a dataset.

What you have got, is 'all' the timesteps inside one file, so it's not a 'temporal' data format (if you follow me).

Question : 
Is the original data stored as complete paths like the csv file you attached, or does the simulation generate one file per step? If it generates one file per step and you have collated it all into a csv file, then we can ...

a) go back to the original data and knock up a reader which loads them one at a time and updates in a 'temporal' way - reading particles one step at a time - this creates nice animations in paraview with the trails incrementing as the particles move. The length of trail can be adjusted and each trail can be coloured nicely. If you store your data in h5part or some other format that is supported well by paraview, then even better.

b) Load the csv file as you have done and generate polylines from the disjoint particles using the ID as a key. I have a csv reader I wrote a few years back which could be tweaked to do this (it assumes successive points are part of the same line - so it'd need a bit of work to recognize the Ids in your data). I don't think there's a filter already in paraview like 'table to points' (or vice versa) which will convert the points into polylines as you require.

I would recommend a) and as you're from ETHZ I can help you with it. However I'm away all next week, so don't get your hopes up too high.

More likely than not, your vtkTestReader::RequestData() returned a
'0'. You might want to put a break point in
vtkTestReader::RequestData() and see why it's returning a 0.

The issue was the pointer to the filestream was being set to NULL after all
reading finished, so when RequestData was called it quite rightly returned a
0. Thanks for the pointer, Utkarsh.

The binary installer for Qt-Cocoa (i386+x86_64 universal) is here:

http://get.qt.nokia.com/qt/source/qt-mac-cocoa-opensource-4.6.1.dmg

However, there is still no Qt-Cocoa SDK installer... To get to the download page you have to go to http://qt.nokia.com/downloads, choose LGPL, an then select the Mac OS X download ON THE RIGHT-HAND SIDE, abort the automatic download and then select the Qt-Cocoa download... Pretty painful.

Hey Utkarsh,

That seems to work great now -- good job! Thanks for getting back to this.

It's weird, though, I could have sworn I filed a bug report on this at the time, but I can't find the listing for it... Did you just keep track of this through the mailing list, or did it show up on the bug tracker? Maybe I screwed something up...

Anyway, it looks like it's working fine now.

Subject: [Paraview] TexturePainter missing Scalar Data
Message-ID: <4B746348.9030201@rwth-aachen.de>

Hello!

I use the vtkSimpleImageToImageFilter to make a nifty little 
segmentation plugin. Below is how I overwrote the SimpleExecute 
function. It looks good and actually does the job, at least in a 
VTK-only (Reader>MyFilter>Writer) setup. It loads in Paraview, but if 
executed I get the following warning and bad/no (visual) results:

Warning: In /opt/ParaView3/Servers/Filters/vtkTexturePainter.cxx, line 173
vtkTexturePainter (0x1a34fd0): Failed to locate selected scalars. Will 
use image scalars by default.


I traced this down to the function:
int vtkTexturePainter::SetupScalars(vtkImageData* input)

which does a

  vtkDataArray* scalars = vtkAbstractMapper::GetScalars(input,
    this->ScalarMode,     this->ScalarArrayName? VTK_GET_ARRAY_BY_NAME : 
VTK_GET_ARRAY_BY_ID,
    this->ScalarArrayIndex,
    this->ScalarArrayName,
    cellFlag);

which becomes NULL. This leads to the above warning. I spent the last 
hours following the information flow in the VTK pipeline and as far as 
my humble understanding goes, all should be fine, because the 
vtkSimpleImageToImageFilter derives from vtkImageAlgorithm which takes 
care that all the OutputPortInformation and all the Requests, etc. are 
setup correctly.

Despite that, Paraview does not seem to have information about the data 
array, at least its not listed where as there IS information on the 
original image: Name:PNGImage DataType: unsigned char, Data Ranges[0,255]...


Here is my SimpleExecution Function:

void vtkDislev::SimpleExecute(vtkImageData* input, vtkImageData*
    output)
    {
      if (input==NULL) {
      vtkErrorMacro(<<"Bad Input to vtkDislev");
      return;
      }
        int dim[3];
      input->GetDimensions(dim);
      int numvox  = dim[0]*dim[1]*dim[2];
      int numcomp = input->GetNumberOfScalarComponents();
        vtkDataArray* inarray  = input->GetPointData()->GetScalars();
      vtkDataArray* outarray = output->GetPointData()->GetScalars();
        unsigned char in=255;
      unsigned char out=0;
      for (int component=0; component < numcomp; component++) {
      for (int i=0; i < numvox; i++) {
          unsigned char v=inarray->GetComponent(i,component);
          if (v >= this->LowerThreshold && v<=this->UpperThreshold) {
          outarray->SetComponent(i,component,in);
          } else {
          outarray->SetComponent(i,component,out);      
      }
      }
      }
}


I would be glad if someone had any idea. Maybe I DO have to rewrite 
these FillOutputInformationVector(...) ?


Best regards,
Christian

Can you try this at the end of SimpleExecute:

outarray->SetName("MyArray");


Does that help?

>>> I noticed something strange when debugging a variation on the clip filter as a plugin, but found that it happens with the standard Clip filter, too. If you switch repeatedly back and forth between Clip Types (Applying in between), the filter starts getting slower and slower and eventually bogs downs completely. To demonstrate:
>>>
>>> Create a default Wavelet Source
>>> Clip Filter -> Apply
>>> Switch from Plane to Box Clip Type -> Apply
>>> Switch back to Plane Clip Type -> Apply
>>> Repeat last two...
>>>
>>> After switching clip types about a dozen times I can see a few second delay before the new clipped data shows up in the render view, and by 13 it takes many seconds to show up. Memory use seems to increase on each iteration, but from about 85 to 110 Mb over those steps, so it's not enormous by the end... If you delete the Clip filter and create a new one, it starts over fresh (w/o memory usage drop) and you can repeat the same eventual slowdown.
>>>
>>> (I can get this to happen both on Mac OS X 10.6.2 x86_64 Cocoa CVS Paraview built with CVS CMake, as well as on today's Ubuntu 9.10 32-bit PV 3.6.2 binary download -- haven't tried any others yet.)

Stephane,

are you still planning to integrate this into 3.8? Is it already in cvs?
I am extremly interested in this. I saw that tagging of 3.8 will be soon.

  Hi all

  I've managed to compiled the plugin. I've loaded a tensor field using the 
EnsightGold format, but the plugin isn't activated in the filter menu. 
What kind of tensor representation activates this plugin?

  many thanks,

Hi Ricardo,

I'm not familiar with the EnsightGold format. But have a look at the two
example files that ship with the plugin: tensors.vtk and tensors8.vtk.
Both get the filter enabled, tested with CVS HEAD.

does the plugin expect full tensors or is it able to coope with simmetric 
tensors? because maybe that's the problem, I see the tensors in the file 
have 8 values per point against my six per point (because I have simmetric 
tensors)

Alexander

https://svn.cscs.ch/vtkContrib/trunk/vtkCSCS/vtkCSCSCommon/

have a look at the code in there. You want vtkCSVBaseReader and the vtkCSVPolyDataReader. they are very old and vtk now has its own (more general) vtkDelimitedTextReader (which is what you have used when you load CSV data in paraview). The polyDataReader above will generate polylines as you require, but will need to be told when to stop one and start the next. Memory fails me but I seem to recall that you can put a 1 in a certain column at the start of each new polyline and it will trigger the reader to end one and start the next. Have a look at it and I'm sure you'll figure it out on your own.

Contact me off list after 20th feb for help if you need it.

Ricardo,

Try experimenting with the plugin's server manager XML.
Currently, it states

<InputArrayDomain name="input_array" attribute_type="point"
 number_of_components="9"/>

I haven't tested what will happen if you alter that to 6, but you might want to
give it a try.

Sven

Is this through python shell or pvpython? Can you attach a debugger
and post the stack trace?

Ricardo,

No, it doesn't work like that. Your symmetric tensor isn't silently translated
into the 3x3 representation needed by class vtkTensorGlyph once you've changed
number_of_components to 6. I guess you'll have to come up with an explicit
conversion by means of e.g. the programmable filter in order to be able to use
the SuperquadricTensorGlyph plugin with your data.

Hi folks,

We have restored the Cave support into ParaView.
You just have to specify a pvx file to enable Cave Rendering.

The Cave Rendering wiki page has been updated with an example.
See
http://paraview.org/Wiki/Configuring_Server_Environment_Using_*.pvx_XML_Files
for
more information.

Feel free to send your feedback.

Thanks,
Julien.

This is great!. One question some of my colleagues asked about head
tracking.

Does it do tracking? It will be really useful to have tracking in the CAVE
like environment without which you wont get the correct perspective.

Aashish

I went through some of these bugs and I believe we can close the following:

This bug has been fixed:
http://www.vtk.org/Bug/view.php?id=9813

I believe we determined that this is by design:
http://www.vtk.org/Bug/view.php?id=9821

This can certainly be solved by using a different file format, as
recommended:
http://www.vtk.org/Bug/view.php?id=8962

I think the animation code has been massively overhauled, so this probably
no longer applies:
http://www.vtk.org/Bug/view.php?id=9217

I guess this is a VTK problem, not a Paraview problem:
http://www.vtk.org/Bug/view.php?id=9213

Thanks,

David

Hi Aashish,

I believe it does tracking.
The directions of the cameras are relative to the client camera.
So if a device tracks the position and orientation of a head, and updates
the client camera, the CAVE cameras will be updated accordingly.

Julien.

Sounds like you are sure about this :)

Also does it mean that client camera now have or supports asymmetric
frustums? Sorry I have not looked into the code.

I attempted to reproduce on my kubuntu 9.10, qt 4.5.2 system, with 
slightly different results, which may be qt/distro/os specific.

On my system as long as the process ParaView spawns finishes on its own 
there is no problem. That's usually how one would expect things to work 
out since when the client disconnects the server closes followed by ssh. 
But, you are right that PV never explicitly kills or otherwise cleans up 
after the process it starts. So if the spawned process for some reason 
doesn't finish orphan processes are introduced.

I was able to produce orphan ssh processes, giving the PV client a 
server start up command that doesn't finish. eg

    ssh ... pvserver ... && sleep 100d

I get the situation you described which prevents further connection on 
the same ports. Once PV tries and fails to connect on th eopen ports, 
there is crash soon after.

I filed a bug report with a patch:

I use pvpython.
I attached the backtrace that I got with gdb.

Thanks

Subject: [Paraview] problems with xdmf-files
Message-ID: <SNT123-W458B94C16C09F178C6A227BC4A0@phx.gbl>


Hi!

I?m using the Xdmf-format for my data files and am used to visualize them with ParaView. I?ve built Paraview from source (the latest version 3.6.2) and everything works fine, but a few days ago I worked on a different computer and just wanted to look at my output, so I installed ParaView via the paraview.exe-file. But suddenly, it cannot visualize my Xdmf-Files, it always says "could not open HDF5 dataset". Why does it work when I build Paraview from source and not with the installer file?

Thx,
Natalie

When you build from source, are using using CVS head? CVS ParaView has
an newer version of XdmfReader.

Looks like all those bugs were reported by you :). In that case, if
the reporter feels that the bugs are no longer applicable -- he should
feel free to mark them as resolved.

I don't think "non-admin" users can mark bugs as resolved, can they? I
didn't see a "Mark as resolved" button anywhere, that's why I thought
someone else had to do it. Maybe I am just missing it?

Thanks,

Hi Utkarsh,

finally I have a chance to take a look at this in depth and get back to you.

> the required properties?
The difference between state and configuration goes beyond the latter 
being a simple subset of the proxy's properties.

One substantial difference is that connection id is central in the state 
implementation. however not only is it not needed for configuration but 
it cannot be used with configuration. So for configuration the lack of a 
connection id is a central feature.

Another distinction is that the state of domains aren't needed by 
configuration.

Yes, that's a fair point. We could pretty easily make use of the lowest 
level of the state implementation, vtkSMXXVectorProperty::SaveChildState 
and vtkSMXXVectorProperty::LoadState, if they were public methods. Why 
aren't these public methods? Will it be OK to make them public? And what 
about the name SaveChildSate, why not just SaveState?

I didn't go down this road in large part because I know how important 
state is to PV, know changing the implementation is sensitive and 
involved task, and didn't want to tackle it without your input. But 
there were also a couple other motivations for a new format and 
implementation.

In regard to the current state implementation and file format, the file 
format is fairly inefficient for example each value in a property vector 
is written to disk as a nested xml element (ie a vector with 256 values, 
requires 257 xml elements). Also in terms of the implementation it's 
very fragile , you modify a state file by hand and make a mistake and it 
crashes PV during the load. I've also seen PV crash loading state across 
major PV versions. All of these facts dampened my enthusiasm for making 
use of the current state implementation and motivated to me to provide 
the new format and fault tolerant implementation.

I implemented validate methods 
(vtkSMXXVectorProperty::ValidateConfiguration) that will parse the XML 
and validate it without making any changes to the property. This is key 
to a fault tolerant implementation, the manager can then validate the 
configuration before applying it. I specifically wanted to prevent a 
partial load that will leave the property in an indeterminate state.

I  think these features are important, nothing is more frustrating than 
going to load a state file and having PV crash. If we make use of the 
current state vtkSMXXVectorProperty::SaveChildState and 
vtkSMXXVectorProperty::LoadState for reading and writing the 
configuration XML we'll still want the validate function don't you think?

My implementation in its current form one does indeed have to implement 
two classes, one reader and one writer. But this involves a minimal 
effort of implementing the following methods from 
vtkSMProxyConfigurationReader/Writer to return various cstrings.

    virtual const char *GetFileExtension()=0;
    virtual const char *GetFileIdentifier()=0;
    virtual const char *GetFileDescription()=0;
    virtual const char *GetReader/WriterVersion(){ return "1.0"; }

I think it makes sense to require an implementor to provide this meta 
data. These are mostly used for high level file validation and  to make 
the file dialog work and error reporting meaningful, but also make the 
file format more human friendly. Beyond implementing these three methods 
no coding is needed, because one can can provide a list of property 
names to operate on at any time using the 
vtkSMPropertyConfigurationManager base class interface.

In the case of the camera configuration, it made sense to have a 
specialized reader implementation vtkSMCameraConfigurationReader that 
could also handle updating the view after a configuration was loaded and 
it was convenient to provide the list of property names in the 
constructor. Providing this list in the constructor is the simplest way 
for specialized implementations. That doesn't neccessarilly preclude a 
more general use case. For example for something more general like a 
reader writer pair for PV's geometric sources, only the three pure 
virtual mothods mentioned above would be implemented, and we would 
provide property names on the fly as the panels are decorated.

The current implementation makes it possible for custom panel 
implementors to simply implement their own configuration reader writer 
pair as needed. I think that's an important feature of any solution that 
we come up with.

Not to get too far ahead of myself, here, just want to explain some of 
my thinking in more depth than I did originally.

I think we still have the issues surrounding the connection id which is 
not used in configuration.

OK, let me know what you think, thanks for working with me on this.

Doh! Ok. I've marked some of them as resolved. I leaving a couple open

Subject: [Paraview] Bug 10274
Message-ID: <4B79C2AF.70300@gmail.com>

I noticed this bug report up on Mantis.
http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=10274
I feel kind of responsible for this since I suggested geometry 
compression should be investigated.

Just to clarify: The investigation I made 
(http://www.paraview.org/Bug/file_download.php?file_id=2866&type=bug) 
showed at most a 2x speed up, and only for very large data and slower 
networks. If you are going to implement geometry compression then there 
are a couple of things to keep in mind:

1) geometry compression hurts performance on fast networks
2) only makes much of a difference (and at most 2x speedup) on slower 
networks for very large data
3) for binary floating point data, zlib compression level affects run 
time drastically, but higher levels don't increase the compression ratio.

I noticed that in vtkMPIMoveData the compression ratio is set by the 
compile time variable Z_DEFAULT_COMPRESSION, which is typically 6, that 
will kill any hopes of a speedup. You should always use zlib compression 
level of 1 on the binary floating point data.

Also, if you're going to compress geometry or other binary floating 
point data during communication you might look at LZO
http://www.oberhumer.com/opensource/lzo/
I didn't do any benchmarks with LZO but they claim it's faster than zlib.

FYI, I've made this a setting on the filter and made it off by
default. The next step would be to expose it as a GUI level setting
for the user to enable/disable as needed.

Message-ID: <20100215215712.M56934@math.asu.edu>

Hello,

I am having problems importing a picture (it is a label that has Greek
characters) in a 3D plot. I had the impression that it is possible to have a
3D plot (for example, the density field in a flow) and the label for density
(rho) using a picture.

Your help will be greatly appreciated.
Thanks

Subject: [Paraview] Cannot find SaveData for python scripting
Message-ID: <4B7A73F4.9070006@am.uni-erlangen.de>

Hi,

I searched and googled but could not find the python call for SaveData().

I import my data by my own reader and want to export it as VTK file by
scripting.

Any hints? Is there a doxygen documentation or something like that for
the
complete python interface? I just have the examples from the web and
the online
python help.

Thanks,

Fabian

Yes, I noticed that CVS ParaView has a newer version of Xdmf Reader, the problem is, that the files, that were read without problems in ParaView 3.4.0, now throw this error I spoke of. 
In the version I built from source, I just copied the old XdmfReader in the Code, but I?m wondering why this problem occurs. Surely the XdmfReader should be backwards compatible? Does it use a new version of the Xdmf format, or.. ?

Thx,
Natalie

I was looking for this the other week too.

To save a state: servermanager.SaveState() 

To load a state: servermanager.LoadState()

If there is a command you are looking for that doesn't appear using dir(),
then try dir(servermanager) as it may be hiding in there somewhere.

Cheers,

Adriano

Message-ID: <c9adba421002160312u40a7b1fau7409880c1f1e0245@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have a custom object panel but I do not know how to make this update with
the undo/redo framework.  The current operation is that all the widgets are
linked to the setModified signal, the "Accept" method will gather the
information from the widgets and update the server, and the "Reset" method
will get the data from the server and update the GUI.  The buttons are
working as expected except for the undo where the GUI is not updated to
reflect the changes - is there a method I need to implement to do this?  I
look at pqCalculatorPanel in ParaView and noticed that it doesn't update
with undo either (is this a bug?)....

Thanks in advance for any help,
Paul

I am simply opening the png file when I have my 3D plot, what happens is that
paraview opens a new window for a 2D plot. How should I import the image?

Rafael,

Just close the 2D view after importing the image, switch back to a 3D view and
turn on visibility of the imported image by clicking on the grayed out eye next
to it in the pipeline browser. You might have to reset the camera, though, to
auto-adjust zoom etc. in order to be able to see the image along with your other
3D objects.

If you directly

You can alternatively create the "Plane" source, then apply the
transform filter to move the plane to where ever you want the label to
be (make sure all scale factors are > 0). Then on the display tab,
there from the "Apply Texture" combo box, choose load and load your
png.

Opps hit the reply a bit too quickly what I was adding as a prefix was follows:

"if you directly import the image, it may be a bit tricky to position
it in the 3D view."

So long as object inspector panels, don't change any server manager
properties anywhere except in the accept(), you don't need to worry
about undo-redo.
The calculator has a bug (which is being fixed currently) though the
undo-redo work correctly, the panel never updates to reflect the
current underlying property value and hence never updates.

Subject: [Paraview] Wave propagation animation
Message-ID: <49e98fc51002160929q6fe5b00m34acb329abd6d2b3@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am simulating a wave propagation in a discretized 3D volume. I have
a sequence of raw float data files that contain the intensity of all
the discretized cells of the wavefield for each time step. I would
like to create an animation to see how the wave propagates within the
volume but I don't know how to do it. Can anyone tell me how should I
proceed?

Thanks in advance

Message-ID: <c19fcadc1002161212s53f8a9e9g20aa3ca1e8e22a76@mail.gmail.com>

Can we add an interface to vtkVertexGlyphFilter? Many times a data set
will have geometry which is supposed to be interpreted as 0D topology,
but in Paraview nothing is displayed. A sphere glyph with a small
radius works, but for big data sets it is not practical. Either the
Filters->Glyph could have Glyph Type = "Vertices", or a new filter
could be added to the menu (Filters -> VertexGlyphs).

Thoughts?

Thanks,

The current glyph filter will let you pick 2D glyph, vertex, which
just draws a GL_POINT. Alternatively their is the point sprite mapper
plugin, which does much much more.

I am only updating in the accept() and I am having the same problem as the
calculator - undo/redo is actually working, just not updating the GUI.  What
will you be doing to fix this for the calculator as I need to do the same
for my plugin?  (or could the paraview framework be updated to call reset()
after the server properties are updated? - this would fix both the
calculator and my plugin.....)

Folks

I am evaluating the possibilities of using the HyperOctree to support an
astro-physics code. First question: Can we set a threshold to switch the
GeometryFilter to a bounding box mode when loading an hyperoctree? By
default the surface-mode is always ON and for an octree beyond 8 levels
of refinement, things are getting heavy.

Second question: I don't see what method should be used for
parallelizing the construction of the octree. Could one use  tags such a
mixture of UPDATE_RESOLUTION and UPDATE_PIECE_NUMBER  to divide up the
load? Are filters downstream ready to propagate the meta-data requests
for octrees? The example of the HyperOctree Fractal does a depth-first
construction. I suppose breadth-first is also possible since the
HyperOctreeCursor enables navigation in both direction. Simulation codes
actually use space-filling curves (e.g. Hilbert curves or others) and in
terms of reading back the data, this could one efficient way to access
data from disk, where each server follows a segment of the Hilbert
curve.  I just don't know if anyone has ever done parallel octree builds
in ParaView and if this is feasible?

The panel should be listening to changes in the server manager
properties to update the panels. This will also help in the case where
a property is updated from the python shell.

Yes. If you send me a patch, I'll commit it right away.

I forwarded this to Charles and Brad who originally developed the octree
functionality.

Can we chat sometime in the near future about this?

Subject: [Paraview] Moving slice with particle
Message-ID: <4B7C0F6D.7060005@tp1.rub.de>

Hello,

I have encountered the following problem in a set of animations:
There is a moving particle in a field and I want to slice the field
at the particle's position (effectively the y-component of the position).
Additionally the slice should move automatically with the particle
for making an animation.
Has anybody done something like this before?
The programmable filter seems a good point to start, but I need
at least two inputs for figuring out the offset.
Thanks in advance for any pointers or help!

Cheers,
    Thorsten

vtkHyperOctree uses a compact representation within a few
contiguous arrays and use indexes instead of pointers.
It allocates all octree nodes in these arrays.  New nodes
get spots at the end.  When a node is deleted we move a node
from the end back to fill in the hole.  This keeps the arrays
contiguous and gives good locality of reference and makes
*serial* operations very fast.

The trade-off is that the structure (at least in the current
implementation) does not support updates from more than one
thread at a time.  Any kind of parallel octree construction
would have to do one of the following:

(a) Use synchronization primitives to update the structure.

(b) Construct one octree in each thread whose root node is
    one of the children of the final octree, and combine them
    at the end, serially.

(c) Investigate the implementation of vtkHyperOctree in more
    detail than I'm posting off the top of my head to see if
    it can be taught to do parallel updates (not likely).

Summary: vtkHyperOctree was optimized for computation within
a single thread.  Its design does not lend well to threading.

I could not really understand how to use the --machines flag though.

what should be in the network configurations file? or how is -machines used?

Subject: [Paraview] Running a pure data server
Message-ID: <4B7C40CD.30802@msic.dia.mil>

We are trying to set up a pure mpi data server with rendering only 
taking place on a client.  I have been successful in building the mpi 
version with references to the opengl libs that works on the interactive 
machines (opengl is installed on the interactive machines) in our 
cluster (running sles 11), but that limits me to 8 cpus.  I really want 
to run on our main cluster with machines that do not have any opengl 
libs, or x, or OSMesa at all because they have no graphics cards at all.

I have tried setting cmake paths to opengl and OSMesa to the appropriate 
paths in my network home directory (h: drive on a netapp) where I built 
mesa, but the pvserver I get from that build even when run with the 
--disable-composite flag still tries to load up opengl on the server 
machine rather than from my h: drive.

Is it possible to build so that pvserver does not try to use opengl or 
OSMesa?  Or can I build in such a way that pvserver only needs the path 
for opengl and OSMesa wrt my h: drive?

Vr,

Brian Greiner

Subject: [Paraview] Volumes of Interest
Message-ID: <SNT123-W5151452E83C3823F370737BC470@phx.gbl>


Another topic - selecting volumes of interest: I can do that for one file, and it works well. But is it really necessary to repeat this procedure for every file I open in Paraview? Is it possible to select a volume of interest and for every file I open afterward, just this VoI is displayed?

The best way I can think of doing this is to add a GUI plugin that copies
and modifies File->Open. It would open the file and then apply the filter
with the VOI you want.

Hi Brian,

Have you seen this page:
http://paraview.org/Wiki/Setting_up_a_ParaView_Server

What you need to do is:

- Compile Mesa with OSMesa support
- Compile ParaView against this Mesa with OSMesa support turned on
- Run pvserver (make sure that the Mesa libraries are in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH
on the cluster) with --use-offscreen

You don't even have to disable compositing if  you wanted to use software
rendering on the server. OSMesa does not depend on x11. It is pure software
and does not require a display.

How do I do that? Is there something similar already in the code so I can have a look on that?

Thanks for the quick reply.

I would suggest doing this in Python in order to avoid reading the full
resolution dataset by default. When opening a file, paraview forces you
to click Apply before you can do anything else (such as creating an
Extract Subset filter). Thus, the data reader uses
UPDATE_EXTENT=WHOLE_EXTENT and you may run out of memory before being
able to subset the grid.

if instead, you instantiate your reader, do not execute it, do not
create a representation for it, then create an Extract Subset with the
VOI you desire, and then execute the whole thing, you will end-up
passing the VOI extents upstream directly to the reader, and your reader
will only execute once with the correct extents.

Use the python shell and the followin example:

reader = XMLImageDataReader( FileName= '/path/to/data/foo.vti'] )
reader.PointArrayStatus = ['data1']

ExtractSubset1 = ExtractSubset()

ExtractSubset1.VOI = [2000, 2255, 2000, 2255, 2000, 2255]

DataRepresentation2 = Show(ExtractSubset1)

Render()

Subject: [Paraview] Color scale editor
Message-ID: <BAY109-W35E903B541B2CF822DF029B2470@phx.gbl>


Hello,
I tried to add 3 points to the blue-to-red colormap:
  - 1 point at value -0.001 with default color (ie I keep the color from the blue-to-red ramp)
  - 1 point at value 0.001 with default color
  - 1 point at value 0 with black color
in order to clearly identify zone for which the value is exactly 0.
But the editor behaviour is annoying: I put a value in the line edit widget, click close, and when I come back to the editor the value has not been changed.
Dragging the circle with the mouse is not more reliable: it seems that the editor prevents from having the circle going too close from each other.
So:
  - a suggestion: a "set" button would be useful to take into account a change in the coordinates of a point without having to close the editor and go back to it next
  - a question: how to cope with this annoying behaviour of the editor?

I didn't mention Python because it doesn't give you a way of popping up a
file chooser - you have to edit the script and change the file name. Maybe
we should add a Python command to pop up the file chooser... It is not super
easy but if there is enough demand, we can do it. Feel free to add a feature
request to the bug tracker or uservoice.

What platform is this on? On my linux box the value seems to be
updated quite reliably. You may want to use "tab" to make the line
edit loose focus so that it accepts the value.

Subject: [Paraview] Pruned output for extract block
Message-ID: <c9adba421002180645j71bf20bfx44fb8812c4bd097f@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

What is the reason for pruning the structure in the "Extract Block" filter
when there is only one child item?  I output the following structure from
the custom reader:

   - output (multi-block dataset)
      - zone 1 (multi-block dataset)
         - volume (unstructured grid)
         - boundaries (multi-block dataset)
            - blade (poly data)
            - hub (poly data)
            - case (poly data)
         - zone 2 (multi-block dataset)
         - volume (unstructured grid)
         - boundaries (multi-block dataset)
            - blade (poly data)
            - hub (poly data)
            - case (poly data)

If I were to extract both the blades then the resulting structured would be:

   - output (multi-block dataset)
      - blade (poly data)
      - blade (poly data)

This has now lost all the information from the original structure.

Commenting out the section for the case when there is only one child item
fixes this for me:

Could this case be removed in the main CVS or is there a good reason for
keeping it?  (maybe an option could be added for it....)

Thanks,

Hey Natalie,

This may be a long-shot, but are you sure the HDF5 looks fine on your other machine? I haven't investigated it yet, but one of my colleagues said he had trouble recently when transferring an HDF5 file to another machine which had a different "endian-ness" and he couldn't read it. Can you try looking at the file with HDFView or h5dump and see if it looks "right" on the machine where you had trouble?

Your xmf file looks fine to me. In the Attribute section Type should be changed to AttributeType with the newer format, but the reader handles the older notation just fine (at least on my machine). Since I didn't have your hdf5 file, I tried changing the attributes to XML format and it loads fine on both my CVS and 3.6.2 binary (although, some of the attribute scalar ranges are screwed up on 3.6.2, so maybe I didn't do it perfectly...).

Actually, that isn't a bad idea.  There doesn't seem to be a way of 
getting input to a Python script, as raw_input() doesn't appear to work 
in the Python Shell (in the PV GUI, at least) either.

If you set a variable in the paraview python console before running a
script, the script will have access to that variable.  So you can pass
arguments to a python script by just setting sys.argv in the python console
before running the script.

Sean... I happen to have a patch that allows raw_input() to work from the
paraview gui.  Patch is attached.  When the script calls raw_input() it
causes a focused qt text entry box to appear at the cursor.  The entire
paraview gui is blocked until the user hits enter.  Not perfectly elegant,
but works pretty well.

The pvblot plugin I wrote makes extensive use of querying the user for input
from the gui.  I decided not to use raw_input() because it blocks the gui.
Instead I cooked up a fancy asynchronous input scheme using python
generators, decorators, and the yield statement.  It works really well, but
requires that you write your script using yield instead of raw_input().

Berk, I think we could add a method to the paraview.simple module that does
a callback to the gui for a file dialog, it would be similar to my attached
raw_input() patch.

Can someone add a feature request in the bug tracker? Utkarsh: should we
shoot for 3.8 or 4.0?

It is definitely doable with the programmable filter although not as trivial
as it would be with a tool like VisTrails. The programmable filter can
accept multiple inputs. You could use the point from on of its inputs to
setup the parameter of an internal slice filter - which requires importing
the vtk.graphics module. If you can't figure it out, let me know, I'll help.

Most of building blocks I was able to figure out, but how do
I retrieve the second input from the servermanager?

My problem is as follow: I am writing a vtkDataSetAlgorithm filter and I need to create the ouput dataset, which must be of the same type as the input.
Is there a one-line way to do it, ie avoiding if (input->IsA("vtkPolyData") output=vtkPolyData::New(); else if ... ?

vtkDataSet* output = input->NewInstance();

vtkDataSetAlgorithm::RequestDataObject() already does this though. You
shouldn't need to. See that method for details.

Message-ID: <50114.94.192.82.186.1266589647.squirrel@webmail.bris.ac.uk>

Hi
I am currently trying to build paraview from the source code with shared
libraries on. I was able to build this code using CMake 2.8.0 and microsoft
visual studio 9 before however BUILD_SHARED_LIBS was off. When I turn this
value to on I am still able to generate the files in CMake but I get
errors whilst building paraview in visual studio.

The main errors are;

vtkCommon,
c:\paraview3\vtk\common\vtkDataArrayTemplate.h(318) : error C4430: missing
type specifier - int assumed. Note: C++ does not support default-int

vtkFiltering,
c:\paraviewtrunk_mpi1659\vtk\common\vtkArrayIteratorTemplate.txx(32) :
error C2491: 'vtkArrayIteratorTemplate<T>::New' : definition of dllimport
function not allowed
a block of similar errors is created following this error.


Thanks for any help in advance.
Jacob Cook

Thanks for this! But contrary to my earlier optimism it seems not so 
easy to
use a slice filter in a programmable filter (I played mostly with the 
pvpython
  up to this point)
The python vtk module does not export ExtractVOI or ImageSlice filter,
the generic cutter does not work for me.
If I import paraview.simple a new connection pops up and PV itself is 
messed up,

I just wrapped servers/filters (where vtkPVExtractVOI and
vtkPVImageSlice reside) the other day.

So, to use them you will need to use paraview cvs and import pvfilters
in your script.

Subject: [Paraview] plotting allong curves
Message-ID: <000701cab175$fbd1a170$f374e450$@dubsky@gcsc.uni-frankfurt.de>

Hi,

I'd need to do X-Y plot along curves in ParaView. I've looked throught the
mail list and the wiki and it seems this feature has been requested (and
also promised to come in the next release) in 2008.

However I didn't find any more information to this.

What I need to do is to plot the scalars along a curve (circle if possible)
based on my data imported through VTK.

Is this actually possible in the current 3.6.2 version in ParaView?

 

Thanks for a reply

 

Josef

It's not available in 3.6.2, but it has been available in the CVS
version for quite some time now and will be included with 3.8. There's
a new filter named "Plot On Intersection Curves".

Dear ParaView users,

I would like to know if it is possible to give names to blocks of data?

For instance, I created a box and a cone using the adequate sources.I used
then the "GroupDatasets" filters.
With the obtained multiblock dataset, may I keep distinction between the box
and the cone in ParaView, and may I give them a understandable name?

Basically, I would have liked when using the "extract blocks" filter having
displayed the name of the blocks for instance.
(I send you a picture of my test: the filter names box_and_cone is actually
a "group datasets" filter)

The need behind is actually to create a test data for X3D display.
Will then it be possible to export the data obtained as X3D file keeping
track of the objects as different ones (because in ParaView, they are
different blocks)?

I thank you in advance for your help.
Best regards,

Pierre

I have two separate meshes that are similar, but have slight differences.
They have the same number of points.  I would like to use the calculator to
create an array of the distances between corresponding point ID's in the two
meshes.  How can I access the coordinate values from each mesh using
calculator?

For Example, in my calculator I would like:

 Result Array Name= Distance
Function:  Mag(mesh1.coords-mesh2.coords)

The calculator will not accept multiple inputs, so if you want to use
it you will have to append the data first, which makes it hard to
compare side by side.

You should consider using the python programmable filter instead. It
will accept multiple inputs (there was a post earlier this week on the
mailing list descriing how to access each one) and there are examples
on the wiki of scripts which iterate through the geometry of its
input.

In the next release, this will be very easy to do with the Python
Calculator. It will look like:

inputs[0].PointData['some_array'] - inputs[1].PointData['some_array']

Subject: [Paraview] Enabling dataset visibility wiggles camera
Message-ID: <c19fcadc1002191220i7d49b8eane66bc5ef00f0fdec@mail.gmail.com>

I have two vtp files opened, A and B. I have A visible and B invisible (the
eye in the pipeline browser). When I make B visible to see them both at the
same time, the camera moves slightly (things in data set A move probably 50
pixels). When I make B invisible again, the camera moves back to where it
was.

Is there a way to stop this from happening? I believe it is a new behavior.

Thanks,

David

Message-ID: <4B7EF8A6.4040201@lanl.gov>

I am looking for a file format that will support input of primitives 
such as sphere. The VRMl2 (*.wrl) format appears to support this, but 
this format is superceeded by X3D and I am having difficulty finding 
documentation for the old format. Their does not appear to be a paraview 
reader for X3D.

Are there other file formats that will support primitives? Sphere, cube, 
cone, etc... Or does anyone know where to find some documentation for 
the VRML2 file format that paraview has a reader for?

Thanks

Message-ID: <965D1ECD-AB1F-4247-B935-FC67368E5BCC@bluequartz.net>

I'll state up front that I know 3.6.2 only officially supports Qt  
4.3.x but I'll go ahead with my bug report/question any ways.

   So I built Qt 4.6.1 with Cocoa (OS X) and then compiled ParaView  
3.6.2 from source using shared libraries. Everything compiles fine.  
ParaView then launches fine. I setup up some sort of pipeline (Does  
not matter what) then the strangeness happens. For example, load up a  
Box source, then glyph it.

   Now, click on the "Glyph1" to activate it. Now, click on the  
Display tab to adjust some parameter (Again, does not matter what).  
Now Click back on the "Box1" in the Pipeline Browser. Now try to click  
on the "Properties" or "Information" tabs. What happens is that the  
Object inspector windows goes blank and the Pipeline Browser elements  
all become un-selected.

   It seems the only way to select a new element in the Pipeline  
browser and have it "stick" to to actually double-click on a pipeline  
browser element. Then you can select something in the "Object  
Inspector" area.

   If I build with Qt 4.6.1 with Carbon none of this happens. I will  
assume that this is a problem with Qt itself since switching to Qt/ 
Carbon seems to fix the problem. Just wondering if anyone else has  
seen this behavior. I can reproduce it on a Mac Pro (Xeon 5500 with  
ATI 4870) and a MacBook Pro with nVidea 8600m graphics.

   What I have not tried is to go back to Qt 4.5.3 Cocoa/Carbon and  
try those to see if they work/don't work.

Thanks for any feedback.

  I've checked the Ensight Gold format and against the reader of paraview 
and come to notice there's an error in the reader.

  The ordering of values in the Ensight Gold format for a simmetric tensor 
is:

  SXX, SYY, SZZ, SXY, SXZ, SYZ

  but paraview seems to be reading:

  SXX, SYY, SZZ, SXY, SYZ, SXZ

  which is not correct...

We've started supporting Cocoa only with ParaView CVS (and in future
with 3.8). Can you see if you can reproduce the issue with CVS? There
have been several fixes to CVS to work with Cocoa.

To make sure that I understand, vtkCutter does not work, right? Why? Are you
trying to extract a cut/slice or a subset with constant i, j or k from an
image data?

You cannot name blocks with a filter but you can name them if the reader
supports this feature. I believe a few readers support this feature - the
EnSight reader for example. I don't think the X3D exporter knows anything
about blocks though. It exports the scene directly and the geometry from the
blocks is merged before it makes it into the scene.

I am not sure I understand. Do you want to be able to define a scene in
terms of primitives or do you want to be able to load primitives defined as
a collection of polygons? ParaView does not really support the concept of a
primitive bigger than a cell - polygons, tets, hexes etc etc. So even if
there is a reader for a format that supports primitives, they would have to
be converted to polygons upon load.

Maybe if you can provide us some use cases, we can help better.

Best,

Hrmpf. I ran into this same bug today with multi-block data. Would you mind
submitting a bug report? I suggest that we fix this for 3.8. Also, we should
investigate doing this with Xdmf.

Right, vtkDataSetAlgorithm::RequestDataObject() seems to do the job but now I have another problem: the point data are no longer copied to the output.
Here is my code, what is wrong?

  // get the output
  vtkInformation *outInfo = outputVector->GetInformationObject(0);
  vtkDataSet *output = vtkDataSet::SafeDownCast(outInfo->Get(vtkDataObject::DATA_OBJECT()));

  // pass all associated data to output dataset
  output->CopyStructure(this->input);
  output->GetPointData()->PassData(this->input->GetPointData());
  output->GetFieldData()->PassData(this->input->GetFieldData());

and another question: is GetFieldData() the same as GetPointData() + GetCellData() ?

vtkDataSet* output = input->NewInstance();

vtkDataSetAlgorithm::RequestDataObject() already does this though. You shouldn't need to. See that method for details.

Matt,

do you have a correspondence between the nodes meaning node1(x) of
model1 needs to be compared with node1(x) of model2? Otherwise this will
not work and you have to search for nearest nodes first.

Where is the code? In RequestData()?

GetFieldData() != GetPointData() + GetCellData()

FieldData is a set of arrays associated with the whole data object and not
necessarily with points or cells. This may be some meta-data like integral
of pressure for example. Or anything else your heart desires :-)

Hmmm. Then I don't have an explanation why point data is not getting copied.

output->GetPointData()->PassData(this->input->GetPointData());

should do it.

Subject: [Paraview] povray exporter
Message-ID: <4B81080F.3070905@gmx.de>

Hello,

I just tested the povray exporter for glyphs. It seems, that the 
exporter does not include the coloring depending on the variable!?
Maybe, I am missing some option during the export...
Would be nice, if you have a hint, how to export to povray using paraview!

Thanks in advance!
Fabian

Here my probably faulty python code:

slice = vtk.vtkCutter()

plane = vtk.vtkPlane()

plane.SetOrigin(0,0,0)

plane.SetNormal(0,1,0)

slice.SetCutFunction(plane)

slice.SetInput(field)

slice.Update()

out.SetFieldData(slice.GetFieldData())


The result is an empty Output Window popping up along with an empty 
output field.

Jacob, a "clean build" typically means "make clean" or
"make distclean" before you build again with shared libs.
If these targets are not available, you may need to
remove the whole of the paraview build tree, or start
afresh in a new directory, starting from extracting the source
from the tar file.

Subject: [Paraview] problem with new representation plugin
Message-ID: <c9adba421002220448p55d77b4erbe25926721fb4551@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have compiled the representation plugin in the CVS and I have the problem
that I cannot change the colour for the "Special Mapper" in the Object
Inspector's "Display" panel.  This seems to be due to the display properties
being for the surface representation rather than the wireframe (it shows
"Set Solid Color..." rather than "Set Ambient Color...").  Does anyone know
who to fix this?

Thanks in advance,
Paul

Message-ID: <ce609b741002220510gc5223e3se51b5afbec47c34a@mail.gmail.com>

I am using one mesh that is deforming in time.  So node1.mesh2 is the the
same node as node1.mesh1, just in a different location in space.

But your point is well made that if I were using unrelated meshes (i.e.
roughly similar geometry but with a different number of nodes in each mesh)
finding the closest node would be a good way to go.

Best Regards,

Subject: [Paraview] Volume reader
Message-ID: <7c13d8ff1002220615u3e608c47mbd54dde17d459abb@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

I am trying to write a VTK reader to read custom volumetric data into Paraview.

I started with the example vtkImageAlgorithm
(http://www.itk.org/Wiki/VTK_Examples_vtkImageAlgorithm_Filter) and
changed it so the Filter doesn't take any input and output a
vtkImageData.

To simplify, I generate a vtkImageData with constant values in the
RequestData method of my filter and assign it to the output using
output->ShallowCopy(imageData) at the end of the method.

When I tried to use this reader as plugin in Paraview, the views
(Outline, Volume) of the data are not working because the dimension of
the vtkImageData are null.

I tried to use the same filter in a VTK code. The output has a
dimension and I can print the content of the vtkImageData. If I add a
Outline actor, I am able to see the extend of the data but if I attach
a Volume actor, I get this error during the runtime :

 terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::bad_alloc'
  what():  std::bad_alloc

If I copy the content of the output into a new vtkImageData, then I am
able to see the data using the Volume Actor and I don't get anymore
the error.

Did I forget something while declaring my filter ?

I attached the header and implementation file of my filter and the
main.cxx for the VTK test.

I am using Paraview 3.7.0 on Ubuntu 9.10.

Thanks for your help,

Sebastien

One solution is to share common properties with the
SurfaceRepresentation sub-proxy using the <ShareProperties> tag. You
can add exceptions (you will have to add exceptions for Input,
Representation properties at the least).

I can't see how this is possible through the SharedProperties as the color
combo box that is displayed in the "Display Properties" is chosen from the
result of pqPipelineRepresentation::getRepresentationType()  (from the call
in pqDisplayProxyEditor.cxx line 695).  This will default to
vtkSMPVRepresentationProxy::SURFACE for all user defined representations
inheriting from SurfaceRepresentation type - really this should be checking
the subtype ID that is specified in the XML file, although I'm not quite
sure how this can be done....

Can you get it to work with the example plugin?

Thanks,
Paul

Subject: [Paraview] Error in ParaView CVS Head with CMake Configuration
Message-ID: <26FB159D-5A6F-4484-8DBD-3E611B954E54@bluequartz.net>

Pulled the latest CVS Head from GitHub? Is that really the latest?

  When I tried to configure ParaView with my plugins using  
PARAVIEW_EXTRA_EXTERNAL_MODULES I get the following error:

-- Plugin: IPFFilter enabled
CMake Error: File /Components/pqObjectPanelImplementation.h.in does  
not exist.
CMake Error at /Users/Shared/Kitware-CVS/ParaView/CMake/ 
ParaViewPlugins.cmake:281 (CONFIGURE_FILE):
   configure_file Problem configuring file
Call Stack (most recent call first):
   /Users/mjackson/Workspace/PVMXADataModel/Source/Client/IPFFilter/ 
CMakeLists.txt:93 (ADD_PARAVIEW_OBJECT_PANEL)

IPFFilter is my own plugin. The problem is that ParaView_QT_DIR is NOT  
defined at the point where my CMake code is executed. Looking at the  
top level CMakeLists.txt file I see that the Plugins are loaded at  
line 238 (INCLUDE(ParaViewCommon)) which then picks up my code. The  
problem is that ParaView_QT_DIR is NOT defined until line 272 in the  
top level CMakeLists.txt file. This causes problems for my external  
modules because I have Qt code that needs to be compiled.

   Is this a bug or am I just missing something?

Message-ID: <D2606804-9385-4096-B83C-BF84D6E7B2DC@bluequartz.net>

I have some custom filters that I have developed. I use the  
"PARAVIEW_EXTRA_EXTERNAL_MODULES" to compile them directly into  
ParaView. I know they are getting compiled as I can see the compile  
command go by on the command line. The problem is that they do not  
show up when I run ParaView in the filter list. Here is an example XML  
File:

<ParaViewFilters>
   <Category
     name="Microstructure"
     menu_lable="&amp;Microstructure">
     <Filter
       name="IPFFilter"/>
   </Category>
   <Filter
     name="IPFFilter"/>
</ParaViewFilters>

Which is added like so in my CMake files:
# -- Add the Client side xml
set(IPFFilterClient_XML ${PVMXADataModel_SOURCE_DIR}/Source/Client/ 
IPFFilter/Resources/IPFFilter_GUI.xml)
PARAVIEW_INCLUDE_GUI_RESOURCES( "${IPFFilterClient_XML}" )

This works just fine with ParaView 3.6.2. This was a completely clean  
build.

Suggestions? Thanks.

Utkarsh,
   I was able to pull the latest CVS HEAD for ParaView and compiled  
that against the Qt 4.6.1 Cocoa build that I have and it seems that  
what ever was changed on CVS HEAD fixed the problem.

Thanks for the heads up.

Message-ID: <45ed09381002221010n54c04bfcjc69455971c869d9d@mail.gmail.com>

Hi
I have time series data. I want to isosurface the data with different value
for each time step - but not those in the animation which linearly
interpolates the isosurface value over time.
I want to isosurface based on max-min of the data at each time step.
How would i do it?

thanks

I just moved the definition of ParaView_QT_DIR to be just before including
ParaViewCommon. Give it a shot and let me know if it doesn't fix your
problem.

One other question:

If I take this one step further, is it possible to send the data at the
current time step to the PPF?

For example I have a mesh deforming in time (ob1) that is being compared to
a baseline with no time data (ob2).  All of the nodes are similar.  After
looking at some of the previous threads, it looks like I can access the data
for the temporal set with:

     ob1 = self.GetInputDataObject(0,0).GetTimeStep(0)
     ob2 = self.GetinputDataObject(0,1)
     some calculation of ob1.t0 and ob2

This hasn't seemed to work quite right however, as Paraview 3.6.2 doesn't
recognize the "GetTimeStep()" portion.  Are there any suggestions?

Also, in the end I would like to animate this.  Each time step, I would like
the PPF to update to the current time step.  So is it possible to say
something equivalent to:

     ob1 = self.GetInputDataObject(0,0).GetCurrentTimeStep()
     ob2 = self.GetinputDataObject(0,1)
     some calculation of ob1.tcurrent and ob2

Are there any recommended documentation resources for the Python api
available in the PPF?

Thanks,

Matt

That seems to have fixed that problem.

Would also be nice if the macro "paraview_build_optional_plugin" was  
in the ParaViewPlugins.cmake file as I have to recreate it in each of  
my Plugins CMake files because the macro is located in ParaView/ 
Plugins/CMakeLists.txt

Thanks

Ok phew, I was not crazy. I can't reproduce it with sources, but here are
two files:
http://www.rpi.edu/~doriad/Paraview_List/wiggle/

Here is the procedure:

1) Load both files
2) color sparse.vtp pink
3) If dense.vtp is toggled on and off, the behavior is correct.
4) If sparse.vtp is toggled on and off, the other data set (dense.vtp)
moves.

Can someone take a look/verify this?

Thanks,

David

Subject: [Paraview] Suggestion for Storing Colors for a Polygonal Mesh
Message-ID: <F16B379C-9942-4AD5-9BCB-18A2FFCFF280@bluequartz.net>

I am in the early stages of designing a new filter that is supposed to  
color triangles based on their normal where the normal is used as an  
input to the filter and a unique color is output for each triangle.

   My questions are:
    Where should I store the color information? As a new set of  
"Scalars" or as Vectors as attribute data for the cells? Also, is  
there a "Standard" that is used to store the Normals for Polygonal  
data (vtkPolyData)? Are they always in an attribute data array called  
"Normals"? I was thinking I need to check first to see if the correct  
type of normals are included already and if not then generate the  
normals during the filter.

Thanks for any help or suggestions.

Actually, the wiggle much more extreme the more the radii vary.  Try with
radius 10 and radius 10,000, produces a really big jump.

I can repeat it with sources.

I think it might just be an opengl aliasing effect.  The points only seem to
move by 1 pixel (but when they all move at once, you definitely see the
wiggle).  If you another object to the scene, like a cone source, it
doesn't move at all.


To repeat:

create point source, set to 1000 points and radius 100, set representation
to outline.
create 2nd point source, set to 1000 points and radius to 10
hide the first pointset and click reset camera
now toggle visibility on/off of first pointset

Also, I loaded your sparse.vtp and dense.vtp files into another vtk based
application, and there is no movement, so it's either a paraview bug or
paraview is using a different representation/mapper than my app.

Message-ID: <BAY109-W317993A02803B0369CE9A1B2420@phx.gbl>


The first - not comment - line in a legacy VTK file is free for the user and can be used to mention, let us say, an approximation method to use with the data for instance, at least I would like to use it for this purpose.
This line can be got back in a C++ code by using vtkDataReader::GetHeader().
Is it possible to get ot from the VTK dataset instead? since a filter has only access to the data, not to the reader.
Or is it another (better) way to encode general information in a dataset? I suppose vtkInformation can be used for this purpose but where does it appear in a file?

Currently CAVE support is in CVS (and will be included in 3.8).

Hello,

when I try to compile the CVS version - or some other - from source,

Subject: [Paraview] Can I delete some items in PV interface?
Message-ID: <BAY109-W451688AA7B2AEC5D34607EB2420@phx.gbl>


Suppose I want to have a PV configured without any toolbar, is it possible?
My general concern is in which respect is it possible to customize the PV interface, using XML specs?

Jonathan,

The -m options is to be deprecated. You can use a *.pvx file to list
the machines hostnames for the dataserver and renderserver processess.
Refer to:

A possible alternative to put such additional parameters in a field data array.

Hey Fred,

Recently there has been a lot of progress on making it much easier to build a customized version of ParaView. In the CVS source there is the capability for "branding" and some nice examples in {PVsource}/Examples/CustomApplications.

The documentation so far is here:

Hey Thorsten,

What platform are you trying to build on, and what version of CMake are you using? What types of non-default options are you tuning on (with cmake) for the build?

Sorry I can't answer your question myself, but these types of details can help others narrow down what problems you may be encountering.

Thanks,
-Eric

Well I corrected the typo but then ran the "wrong" paraview in order  
to test. I ran the standard 3.6.2 branch instead of the CVS branch.  
The problem still persists with the CVS branch.

Hello,

Are the visualization techniques seen in the volview Gallery

http://www.kitware.com/products/vvimagegallery.php


available in paraview ?



thanks,

Hi Ken,
could you please explain us how to compile ParaView 3.6.2 on Red Hat
Enterprise 4?

Can you list all the rpm packages necessary?
In http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView:Build_And_Install#Note:_debian_build we
can see only the deb packages list for Debian, but obviously they aren't the
same on RHEL 4 and we haven't experience on RHEL 4...; moreover, it seems
that qt >= 4.3.3 aren't available on RHEL 4.

Thank you very much.
Luis

Message-ID: <4B84E973.8000306@rwth-aachen.de>

Hello!

I am writng a plugin for my paraview. I already succeeded doing this 
with another filter but this one drives me crazy. I keep getting these

"*** SYNTAX ERROR found in parsing the header file 
/home/christian/programming/pv-plugins/Transformation/ivtkSampleFilter.h 
before line 8 ***

messages, no matter where I put these //BTX //ETX. This is my header:


#ifndef IVTK_SAMPLE_FILTER
#define IVTK_SAMPLE_FILTER

#include "vtkObjectFactory.h"
#include "vtkSimpleImageToImageFilter.h"
#include "xtkBox.h"

class VTK_IMAGING_EXPORT ivtkSampleImageFilter : public 
vtkSimpleImageToImageFilter {
    public:
    static ivtkSampleImageFilter* New();

    vtkTypeMacro( ivtkSampleImageFilter, vtkSimpleImageToImageFilter);
    protected:
    ivtkSampleImageFilter();
    ivtkSampleImageFilter(const ivtkSampleImageFilter&) {};
    void operator=(const ivtkSampleImageFilter&) {};

    //override from vtkImageToImageFilter
    virtual void SimpleExecute(vtkImageData* inp, vtkImageData* out);

    //BTX
    vtkImageData*    vtkResultImage;
    //ETX
    vtkITKFilter_H_Macro;
    /// custom Filter function ///
    template <typename ImageType>
    void ApplyFilter(vtkImageData* vtkInput);
};
#endif

It also complains if I comment out my #include "xtkBox.h", or put some 
//BTX//ETX all around other places. It keeps coming with the error 
message as if I did not even edit the right file. (I do, I checked 
that... :)

I call a macro later in the header which is defined in the xtkBox.h but 
the compiler does not even care if it is defined or not. Anyway, for 
completeness I attached this xtkBox.h.

Does anyone see what I am missing?


Best regards,
Chrsitian

I don't really understand what you are doing but one obvious thing from the
header is that the BTX/ETX is around the wrong way:

//ETX
#include "itkImage.h"
//BTX

should be:

//BTX
#include "itkImage.h"
//ETX

I didn't even realise that the the parser work for templates though...

Regards,
Paul

Sorry, just re-read your post - I see that you attached the header file for
the file you included.  Try this:

#ifndef IVTK_SAMPLE_FILTER
#define IVTK_SAMPLE_FILTER

//BTX
#include "vtkObjectFactory.h"
//ETX
#include "vtkSimpleImageToImageFilter.h"
//BTX
#include "xtkBox.h"
//ETX

class VTK_IMAGING_EXPORT ivtkSampleImageFilter : public
vtkSimpleImageToImageFilter {
  public:
  static ivtkSampleImageFilter* New();

  vtkTypeMacro( ivtkSampleImageFilter, vtkSimpleImageToImageFilter);
  protected:
  ivtkSampleImageFilter();
  ivtkSampleImageFilter(const ivtkSampleImageFilter&) {};
  void operator=(const ivtkSampleImageFilter&) {};

  //override from vtkImageToImageFilter
  virtual void SimpleExecute(vtkImageData* inp, vtkImageData* out);

    vtkImageData*    vtkResultImage;
//BTX
  vtkITKFilter_H_Macro;
  /// custom Filter function ///
  template <typename ImageType>
  void ApplyFilter(vtkImageData* vtkInput);
//ETX
};
#endif

That might work but I haven't really looked to see what your macro is
expanding out to.

Regards,
Paul

Hi Christian,

ParaView/VTK uses a specialized parser tuned for vtk, and this parser has 
some assumptions , and in particular all class names must start with 
"vtk", thus your classes starting with ivtk or xtk will not be accepted by 
the parser. You can try to exclude the offending lines from the parsing 
using //BTX //ETX , but it would be simpler if you keep the "vtk" prefix.

Other limitations : 
the parser will complain if you include more than only the superclass 
header in your header file (and commits to vtk itself will be rejected 
unless you add comments explaining why you had to add those includes)
templated ivars must be between //BTX //ETX 

Some usefull references : 
http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK_Coding_Standards
http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK_cvs_commit_Guidelines

Best,
Stephane

Subject: [Paraview] Problem with fluent reader
Message-ID: <c9adba421002240245r7571e312p39391dde0eab62ad@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm trying to read in a fluent dataset and paraview is throwing an exception
for reading beyond the bounds of the std::string.  The stack trace is as
follows:

vtkFluentReader::GetDataBufferDouble at vtkFLUENTReader.cxx:4029
vtkFluentReader::GetData at vtkFLUENTReader.cxx:4111
vtkFluentReader::ParseDataFile at vtkFLUENTReader.cxx:3948
vtkFluentReader::RequestInformation at vtkFLUENTReader.cxx:436
....

I don't know anything about the format (I tried just returning when the ptr
value was going out of bounds but this resulted in ParaView just allocating
more and more memory) so I'm not sure how to fix this.  Unfortunately I
can't provide the dataset but will run any tests if anyone can send a
suggestion for what to try.

Any help would be appreciated,
Paul

Message-ID: <AB48A31C4EC97E498F4235B7CEF74A19060BFF201A@MBX00.d.ethz.ch>

On the Wiki, there is a discussion of using multiple cores per GPU
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Setting_up_a_ParaView_Server#Sharing_GPUs_Amongst_Processes

One key phrase "GPUs can be implicitly shared by pointing multiple processes to the same display on the same host" tells me that the selection of the display, assumes that an X server is running and you tell each node to use DISPLAY:0.0 etc etc depending on number of GPUs shared between CPUs. In fact later in the wiki this is explicitly written.

Question : Supposing you have no Xserver running but you wish to take advantage of hardware acceleration. Is it possible to create an offscreen buffer for each pvserver without the X server. We'd like to share one GPU between 4 cores, but without starting X.

Can either OpenGL or Mesa (but using GPU not software) be told to do this.

JB

Hello!

Yes, I keep coming with these standard problems. :( Now that my plugin 
compiles, I get the above error message (or sometimes a "... is not a 
valid QT plugin").
I have read about having to add these TypeRevisionMacro calls, but that 
did not help in my case. I attached both .h and .cxx files.

What am I missing now?


Best regards,
Christian

Hi,

I'm currently searching for way to retrieve the coordinates of one or
more selected surface points ("Select Points On" functionality).
How can I display the coordinates of those points?

Best regards,

Hi Christoph,

Use the calculator to add the coordinates as a point data array (function:
coords, result array name: coords). Then go to Selection Inspector, Display
Style, Point Label and select this additional data array 'coords' from the
drop-down list 'label mode'.

Hope this helps.

You need two things:

1) after selection, open up a Selection Inspector panel, the current object is selected. Then make the view window active, go to Display Style of the Selection inspector and make Point Label visible.

Under Label Mode, you can select which field to display,..., and you will not see the coordinates.

2) Go back to your pipeline, and for example, use a Calculator to add the coordinates array to the PointData. Go back to step 1

I am assuming this is with CVS head ParaView. Try setting the
environment variable PV_PLUGIN_DEBUG before launching ParaView. It
should print more information as to why the plugin verification data
mismatched.

Just to be sure, you are building and loading the plugin into the same
version of ParaView.

And, as Ken Moreland suggested last month, you also have this option:

"If you just want to see a list of point coordinates, you could create a spreadsheet view and view your grid in that."

The selections will be linked so selecting points on the surface will highlight rows in the spreadsheet view, and you can view coordinates there (without needing to use the calculator filter).

Hi,

I am new to Paraview and very interested in its CAVE support. I tried 
the CVS version and was able to setup screens thanks to a pvx file 
according to the wiki post. I have a question about head tracking:
Is there any existing tracking support in paraview/IceT ? If it exists 
how can I configure/activate it ? If it does not, how can I contribute 
to its development ?

Thanks

Plus, there's actually a button at the top of the spreadsheet view that I'd never noticed before to "Show only selected elements".

There's a strange inconsistency, though: When I use the standard spreadsheet view (with points selected or not) for a default sphere source, I see Normals, Points & Point ID. If I select points on the sphere and click "Show only selected elements", only the Normals and Point ID show up as columns -- the Points coordinates disappear...

Is this the expected behavior, or a bug?

Thanks,
-Eric

Jean,

Currently, there's no tracking support. You interact with the client -
as if in tile-display mode or regular client-server mode.

Hello!

I don't know if that's a dumb question, but how can I get paraview 
version 3.8? I need to debug a plugin I just compiled and was instructed 
to use the new debugging feature which is available in the newest paraview.
 From cvs, as described in the download section of ParaView's homepage, 
I get Version 3.7.

Best regards,
Christian

ParaView 3.8 does not exist.  The latest stable release is 3.6.2.  Version 3.7 denotes a development version (as do all odd minor revisions).  3.8 is expected to be released sometime this spring.  (Utkarsh might provide more details on the expected release timeframe.)

PV 3.7 is the development version which will eventually become PV 3.8.  
Kitware uses an odd number in the "minor" section of major.minor.patch  
version to distinguish between development versions and release  
versions. Release versions will have an even "minor" version number.

Okay thanks, I guess I can use the debugging feature with the cvs 
version then.

Doh!  Curse you Utkarsh -- again you are one step ahead of us!  :)

I do not know if there is any way to create an OpenGL context on a GPU without first connecting to an X server.  (I prefer to remain blissfully unaware of such details.)  Regardless, I am quite sure that VTK does not support creating such a connection (yet).

Question : Supposing you have no Xserver running but you wish to take advantage of hardware acceleration. Is it possible to create an offscreen buffer for each pvserver without the X server. We'd like to share one GPU between 4 cores, but without starting X.

Can either OpenGL or Mesa (but using GPU not software) be told to do this.

I don't know the details about RHEL rpm packages, so perhaps someone else on the list might be able to answer better.  There might not be a new enough Qt available from Red Hat.  I understand that they are quite conservative when upgrading their packages.  It is probably easier to download Qt directly from Nokia:

Hi Ken,
could you please explain us how to compile ParaView 3.6.2 on Red Hat Enterprise 4?

Can you list all the rpm packages necessary?
In http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView:Build_And_Install#Note:_debian_build we can see only the deb packages list for Debian, but obviously they aren't the same on RHEL 4 and we haven't experience on RHEL 4...; moreover, it seems that qt >= 4.3.3 aren't available on RHEL 4.

Thank you very much.

Well well, here comes the error messages:

Attempting to load 
/home/christian/.paraview-plugins/libSampleImageFilter.so
Failed to load the shared library.
/home/christian/.paraview-plugins/libSampleImageFilter.so: undefined 
symbol: _ZN3itk11LightObject6DeleteEv

Seems to be a ITK thing. I really do not know what that means or even 
how to fix that. As I said, the filter works in VTK-only.

Any ideas?

I am guessing you are missing some link library from itk that would
bring in the LightObject.

Hmm, I don't see how I can provide this information to my compiler since 
the usual way outside ParaView is to have a CMakeList which contains 
something like this

TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES( vtkITKImageBox
   ITKCommon ITKIO
   vtkCommon vtkIO
)

But when I do this in my ParaView-Plugin CMakeList, I get an error message:

CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:16 (TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES):
Cannot specify link libraries for target "vtkITKImageBox" which is not
built by this project.

That's odd because the CMakeList for the VTK-only environment contains 
exactly these lines and everything works. Obviously this has to be 
handled differently for ParaView, but how? It compiled and linked 
without any of this target_link_library stuff in the first place, which 
is strange, because I do need some libraries... ??

So I thought maybe these libraries are only important at runtime, but 
adding the path to the ITK libraries to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH did not help 
either.

Subject: [Paraview] Compiling without X11 libraries
Message-ID: <C7AACEA3.12629%kmorel@sandia.gov>

Is there any way to compile ParaView without any X11 libraries at all?  I compiled OSMesa support for Mesa 3D and tried to link that, but when I link I am missing a bunch of glX* symbols.  I think that in order to build these functions for Mesa, I need an X11 library, which gets me back to the dilemma of what if you have no libraries?

I am not sure about ParaView but in VTK if you turn rendering off you should
be able to do this. Have you tried turning PARAVIEW_BUILD_QT_GUI off? I do
that when I generate the command line tools package on Mac OSX.

I do have PARAVIEW_BUILD_GT_GUI off, but I still need rendering.  I still need to create OpenGL windows, but I will only ever do it through OSMesa, never through X11.

Subject: [Paraview]  Stereo mode in version 3.6.1
Message-ID: <2b35b5e91002241213l74b00e73t3dabfbf156060fe6@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have paraview version 3.6.1 installed in my machine and I normally use it
to see a couple of animations from one of my projects. I'm trying to run
this animation in stereo mode.

I know the command to run paraview in stereo mode for version 3.6.2 is
--stereo (so it will run in red blue stereo mode), but this command doesn't
seem to work for my 3.6.1 version.

Maybe you are asking why I don't open my animations in paraview 3.6.2. The
reason for it is that my animations are not working in version 3.6.2 for
some reason. Paraview stops working when I click on the play button. I
believe it's easier to solve the stereo in version 3.6.1 problem.

Anyone knows the red blue stereo command for 3.6.1 version?

Thank you,
Augusto Escobar

There is another software around which uses the trick of configuring Mesa twice, first with the --with-driver=xlib option to make the lib required for the glX* calls, and a second time to make the other calls available with --with-driver=osmesa.

You may see details of their method here:

Hi Ken,

Below is copy and paste from a previous email where I answered a similar
question off-list (your question is a little different because you want to
use Mesa3D to create windows).  Unfortunately you can't do this without some
small hacks to the cmakelists.  I think the important part for you is in the
last paragraph.

----------

Using true offscreen means using vtkOSOpenGLRenderWindow and not
vtkXOpenGLRenderWindow.  Which one is used depends on whether or not
VTK_USE_OSMESA is defined in $build_dir/VTK/vtkToolkits.h.

VTK_USE_OSMESA is defined when:

  * OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY is set to the empty string
  * VTK_USE_X is OFF
  * VTK_OPENGL_HAS_OSMESA is true

If the platform is Linux, and cmake is able to locate X11 libraries &
headers, then cmake will force VTK_USE_X to ON.  You must hack
VTK/CMake/vtkUseX.cmake to set it to OFF.

Look at the bottom of $build_dir/VTK/vtkToolkits.h to make sure that you
have successfully defined VTK_USE_OSMESA.

If you are doing a shared build, and OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY is the empty string,
then you will get link errors because of some changes that were introduced
after the transitive linking patch last June.  To avoid that, you need to
change all instances of ${OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY} to ${OSMESA_LIBRARY} in all
CMakeLists.txt except for VTK/Rendering/CMakeLists.txt or
VTK/CMakeLists.txt.

Sorry I misread your email, you don't want to create X11 windows at all.
You want to do pure osmesa.  So then you'll be all set if you follow the
hacks I describe.  By the way, when I compile osmesa, for pure offscreen, I
just run 'make linux-osmesa' and the result is libOSMesa.so and libGLU.so.

Message-ID: <7ba9d6a31002241314s49337556v9232b81e1e872257@mail.gmail.com>

Folks,

How many times have we wondered:
* Where's the cell with DISPLACEMENT(Magnitude) == 12?
* What's the point where the error condition is reached?
* What cell is at the location (1,2 3)?

We always knew selection mechanism in ParaView could do that, but we
never found how to get it done -- the selection inspector was just too
confusing. Fret no more: we've added new functionality to ParaView to
help you locate the cells/points of interest.

Refer to following Wiki page for details.

http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Find_Data_using_Queries

This is currently in CVS (very new, so bug reports/feature requests
are always welcome) and should make it into the forthcoming 3.8
release.

Subject: [Paraview] How to color by Cell Data
Message-ID: <9B0808AA-8C10-46AD-8189-8A5DF508C04D@bluequartz.net>

I have a custom filter that sets an RGB value for each cell in a  
surface mesh, where each cell is a triangle. When the filter runs in  
paraview I "see" the new arrays show up when I click on the  
"Information" tab but the "Color By" drop down only has the "Solid  
Color" available.

Here is the relevant parts of the code:

vtkCellData* cd = input->GetCellData();
   vtkDataArray* normals = cd->GetNormals();
   if (NULL == normals || (normals && normals->GetNumberOfTuples() <=  
0 ) )
   {
     std::cout << "NORMALS were not present" << std::endl;
     normals = NULL;
   }

   if (NULL == normals)
   {
     vtkPolyDataNormals* polyNormals = vtkPolyDataNormals::New();
     polyNormals->SetInput(input);
     polyNormals->SplittingOff();
     polyNormals->ConsistencyOn ();
     polyNormals->AutoOrientNormalsOn();
     polyNormals->ComputePointNormalsOff();
     polyNormals->ComputeCellNormalsOn();
     polyNormals->FlipNormalsOff();
     polyNormals->NonManifoldTraversalOff();
     polyNormals->Update();
     output->ShallowCopy(polyNormals->GetOutput());
   }

   cd = output->GetCellData();
   normals = cd->GetNormals();

   vtkUnsignedCharArray* rgb = vtkUnsignedCharArray::New();
   rgb->SetName(INTERFACE_COLORING);
   rgb->SetNumberOfComponents(3);

   vtkDataArray* eulerArray = input->GetFieldData()- 
 >GetArray(OIMColoring::EulerAngles().c_str());
   if (NULL == eulerArray)
   {
     vtkErrorMacro( << "Euler Angles Field Data Missing from Data set.  
This filter requires the euler angles to work");
     return 0;
   }

   double* eulers = eulerArray->GetTuple3(0);
   double* refDirection; //[3] = {45.0, 45.0, 0.0};
   unsigned char bytes[3] =  { 65, 0, 255 };
   for (vtkIdType i = 0; i < normals->GetNumberOfTuples(); ++i)
   {
     refDirection = normals->GetTuple3(i);
     OIMColoring::GenerateIPFColor<double>(eulers, refDirection, bytes);
   //  std::cout << (int)(bytes[0]) << " " << (int)(bytes[1]) << " "  
<< (int)(bytes[2]) << std::endl;
     rgb->InsertNextTupleValue(bytes);
   }

   output->GetCellData()->SetScalars(rgb);
   output->GetCellData()->SetActiveScalars(INTERFACE_COLORING);

Helpful insights are very welcome.

Hi Randy,

Is there any particular thing you are looking for? I don't know what the
experimental user thingy is but I can tell you about co-processing.

Mostly curiosity (killed the cat, I know), but I thought it might perhaps be related to "branding" - something I'm interested in.  The COPROC flag just caught my eye too and took me back several years to a related activity at NCSA.  I'd be curious to learn more about the latter then.  In particular, is it self-contained in PV or does it require a 3rd party lib?

thanks, Randy

Message-ID: <636847371002241906i4dd66a9bl1abe5f4c26077e3d@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

We attempt to do a in-situ visualization to visualize the simulation, which
 is mainly performed on GPUs. I noticed that there was a presentation in
Vis09  describing how to do in-situ visualization with the help of Python
scripts. Since the simulation data reside in GPUs, I wonder whether the
approach mentioned above can do this. Or, are there some better methods to
do that?

Thanks a lot.

Good news, everything works finally. I found a way to make Paraview find 
the necessary ITK libraries.

By chance I found some cmake related postings where there was some 
problem with the LINK_LIBRARIES variable. I was like "Gee, this variable 
looks nice! It could replace my TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES which does not 
work anyway." And voila, everything goes. This is what I put into my 
CMakeList that made Paraview execute my cool plugin (a itkFlipImageFilter :)

LINK_LIBRARIES( vtkITKImageBox
    ITKCommon ITKIO ITKBasicFilters
)

I know, diving a little bit more into CMake would have helped in the 
first place, but you just can't study everything before getting your 
work done.

What's a bit strange is that the plugin is very big (7MB). I am afraid 
that the vtkITKImageBox (which is about that big), or even some ITK 
stuff is cramped into the filter despite my efforts to link everything 
dynamically. I will try to find a solution to this.

Thanks for your help and best regards,
Christian

It depends on how you want to do it. If you want to keep the data on the GPU
memory and perform all of the analysis/visualization on the GPU, VTK is
currently not the right tool. Almost all of VTK's filters work on the CPU
whereas rendering happens on the GPU. If you are OK with moving data to main
memory whenever you want to do analysis/vis, the in-situ vis work we are
doing would be a fit for you. Let me know if you are interested and I can
get you started.

This can be done using python. Attached is a example python script
that you can import in the "Python Shell". It adds an observer to
listen to even "tick" event from the animation and then does the
necessary updates. There was a bug in the CVS (and 3.6 etc) that is
now fixed. Attached is a patch for that change as well, without which
the script won't work.

If you don't want the ExtractBlock filter to prune the output, you can
always simply uncheck the "Prune Output" checkbox.

Utkarsh,

If you do that you will end up with all the empty blocks in the structure.
 I would like to just see the extracted blocks without losing the original
structure.

I think the latest release of MesaLib using a configure script, but older
versions just provided makefiles.  I still use the older releases and run
'make linux-osmesa' to get libOSMesa.so and libGLU.so without any
dependencies on Xlib.

Unfortunately you can't just set libOSMesa.so in place of libGL.so (setting
OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY in cmake) because cmake uses the OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY
variable to check for the existance of real opengl versus osmesa.  So that's
why I said to set OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY to the empty string.

I ran a new build and didn't get any of the link errors I described
previously, so you probably don't have to worry about the other hacks I
mentioned.  The steps should just be:

Edit VTK/CMake/vtkUseX.cmake and set VTK_USE_X_OPTIONAL to 1 instead of 0
(then VTK_USE_X will automatically default to OFF).  Create a new build
folder and configure with -DOPENGL_gl_LIBRARY="".  Set OSMESA_LIBRARY and
OSMESA_INCLUDE_DIR.  Now you should be able to build a pvserver that has no
dependencies on X11 or libGL.

Ah I c. I don't think there was any strong reason for trimming the
tree down. We can definitely add that as an option as well. Any ideas
what to call this new option :)?

It's "--stereo" for 3.6.1 as well.

The EXPERIMENTAL_USER flag is definitely not related to branding. I
believe it's a legacy option (from ParaView 2.6) where certain
experimental feature were disabled unless this option was set. I am
going to remove it since we don't use it in ParaView3 at all.

I don't quite understand that bit below. In what way does cmake care what openGL is being used? I have in the past simply created a symlink libGL which points to libOSMesa - this got rid of glx issues when I was experimenting - but what does CMake 'do' that is causing a problem? (I mean how does CMake checking for real GL instead of OSMesa affect anything?)

JB

Unfortunately you can't just set libOSMesa.so in place of libGL.so (setting OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY in cmake) because cmake uses the OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY variable to check for the existance of real opengl versus osmesa.  So that's why I said to set OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY to the empty string.

I'm terrible with names but.....  If you would like to keep the
default behavior the same then I would suggest an option to "Maintain
structure".

Any good?

Hi John,

Search for VTK_USE_OSMESA in VTK/Rendering/vtkGraphicsFactory.cxx.  Then
look at $build_dir/VTK/vtkToolkits.h to see what is required for
VTK_USE_OSMESA to be defined.

There is also this in VTK/Rendering/CMakeLists.txt:

    IF (VTK_USE_X AND OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY)
      SET(KitOpenGL_SRCS ${KitOpenGL_SRCS} vtkXOpenGLRenderWindow.cxx)
      SET (KIT_LIBS ${KIT_LIBS} ${OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY} )
    ELSE (VTK_USE_X AND OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY)
      IF (VTK_OPENGL_HAS_OSMESA  AND  OSMESA_LIBRARY)
        SET(KitOpenGL_SRCS ${KitOpenGL_SRCS} vtkOSOpenGLRenderWindow.cxx)
        SET (KIT_LIBS ${KIT_LIBS} ${OSMESA_LIBRARY} )
      ENDIF (VTK_OPENGL_HAS_OSMESA  AND  OSMESA_LIBRARY)

Thanks everyone for your help.  I'm pretty sure I got past this issue.

I did have to "hack" VTK/CMake/vtkUseX.cmake as you mentioned.  That said, is there a reason not to check in a change that allows you to set VTK_USE_X (that is, set VTK_USE_X_OPTIONAL) in the case that VTK_OPENGL_HAS_OSMESA is ON?  The system would by default behave the same but would allow you to turn of X in this case when you have OSMesa but no X.

I think the latest release of MesaLib using a configure script, but older versions just provided makefiles.  I still use the older releases and run 'make linux-osmesa' to get libOSMesa.so and libGLU.so without any dependencies on Xlib.

Unfortunately you can't just set libOSMesa.so in place of libGL.so (setting OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY in cmake) because cmake uses the OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY variable to check for the existance of real opengl versus osmesa.  So that's why I said to set OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY to the empty string.

I ran a new build and didn't get any of the link errors I described previously, so you probably don't have to worry about the other hacks I mentioned.  The steps should just be:

Edit VTK/CMake/vtkUseX.cmake and set VTK_USE_X_OPTIONAL to 1 instead of 0 (then VTK_USE_X will automatically default to OFF).  Create a new build folder and configure with -DOPENGL_gl_LIBRARY="".  Set OSMESA_LIBRARY and OSMESA_INCLUDE_DIR.  Now you should be able to build a pvserver that has no dependencies on X11 or libGL.

Subject: [Paraview] crash when trying to use opacity and remote rendering
Message-ID: <alpine.DEB.2.00.1002251819500.30433@localhost>


  When setting the opacity for a value different than 1 with a pvserver the 
pvserver just crashes. This a version compiled from the CVS, running on a 
debian machine with NVidia Quadro graphic board.

  I've added in attach what what the pvserver spits while going down in 
flames.

Ricardo,

What was the type of dataset you were setting this opacity on? Can you
reproduce it with one of the built-in sources or dataset?

Thanks

I read a scalar data set, written in ensight. I did a surface contour. The 
data is written has an ortogonal mesh with values in the vertex.

Ok. I've created a sphere and everything was fine until I pushed the 
resolution in both parameters to higher values (600+). pvserver then 
crashed...

For vtkImageData filters, you need to override "RequestInformation"
method to provide information about whole_extents, spacing and origin.
Look at VTK/Graphics/vtkRTAnalyticSource.cxx as an example. Ideally,
your RequestData() method should also look at the extents that were
actually requested and only produce the output for that extent.

Subject: [Paraview] Combining pieces into one dataset?
Message-ID: <4B874E04.6060302@dtm.ciw.edu>

Hi,
I am new to Paraview and try to put it to use for visualizing a certain 
kind of dataset that consists of two Pieces. The data are given in a 
.vtu file on the two identical subgrids of a so-called Yin-Yang grid 
with minimum overlap, which combine to form a spherical shell; 
essentially, the combined grid looks like a tennisball or baseball.
My problem is that the individual Pieces are shown nicely, and the whole 
dataset also looks correct, but at the boundary between the two Pieces, 
there is a gap, because Paraview doesn't interpolate between them. Is 
there a possibility in Paraview to combine the Pieces into one, so that 
the boundary disappears and everything looks smooth? I had tried to do 
that with Group Datasets, but that doesn't have any visible effect.
I am using Paraview 3.6.2 under Mac OS X Leopard.

Thomas,

Unfortunately, it sounds like what you have got is two datasets separated by a one cell wide gap. Unless you find a way to tell ParaView that there are cells that exist in the gap, then it can't guess. Even if you "append grids", you'll end up with all the cells correct except for the gap region (unless I misunderstood your problem and you actually have grids that touch correctly in which case append grids should work).
The usual way is to provide some ghost cells at the boundary of (one or) both sub-grids - a layer one cell thick that produces the overlap. Whatever is producing the data ought to "know" what cells to add, otherwise your simulation would also have a gap - can you add it to your exported data?

Hi Berk,

Thank you for your reply. One of the priorities  of our in-situ
visualization work is speed, so moving data to main memory  may not be a
preferred approach. We just need several basic visualization functions(e.g.
slice and contour )  and analysis functions(e.g. sub-sampling ). Is it
possible that we write our own filters running on GPU and integrate them
into the current VTK pipeline?  Since the sources, readers,writers and
filters are configured via XML file, if we set up the appropriate filter
 XML configuration file, will it work for us ?

Thanks again,

-Ning

Yes, it is possible though not necessarily straightforward, depending on how
much visualization algorithm and Cuda/GLSL experience you have. Also, you
will have to write a new mapper since the current one works on data on main
memory. If I was estimating how much this would take, I would estimate no
less than 6 months for something like 4 algorithms and 1 mapper.

Try this:

input = self.GetInputDataObject(0, 0)
inp_copy = input.NewInstance()
inp_copy.ShallowCopy(input)
inp_copy.UnRegister(None)
cutter = vtk.vtkCutter()
plane = vtk.vtkPlane()
plane.SetOrigin(0,0,0)
plane.SetNormal(0,1,0)
cutter.SetCutFunction(plane)
cutter.SetInput(inp_copy)
cutter.Update()
self.GetOutputDataObject(0).ShallowCopy(cutter.GetOutputDataObject(0))

or even better:

input = self.GetInputDataObject(0, 0)
origin = self.GetInputDataObject(0, 1).GetPoints().GetPoint(0)
inp_copy = input.NewInstance()
inp_copy.ShallowCopy(input)
inp_copy.UnRegister(None)
cutter = vtk.vtkCutter()
plane = vtk.vtkPlane()
plane.SetOrigin(origin)
plane.SetNormal(0,1,0)
cutter.SetCutFunction(plane)
cutter.SetInput(inp_copy)
cutter.Update()
self.GetOutputDataObject(0).ShallowCopy(cutter.GetOutputDataObject(0))

Subject: [Paraview]  The Quest for Data
Message-ID: <4B87C2A0.7050308@tp1.rub.de>

Nur so am Rande ...

Folks,

How many times have we wondered:
* Where's the cell with DISPLACEMENT(Magnitude) == 12?
* What's the point where the error condition is reached?
* What cell is at the location (1,2 3)?

We always knew selection mechanism in ParaView could do that, but we
never found how to get it done -- the selection inspector was just too
confusing. Fret no more: we've added new functionality to ParaView to
help you locate the cells/points of interest.

Refer to following Wiki page for details.

http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/Find_Data_using_Queries

This is currently in CVS (very new, so bug reports/feature requests
are always welcome) and should make it into the forthcoming 3.8
release.

Subject: [Paraview] Cells and Points in a Structured Grid Volume
Message-ID: <4B87EC8B.4080406@rwth-aachen.de>

Hello!

I am studying the Threshold Filter to dive more into the mechanics of 
filtering and I just want to make sure I got the meaning of points and 
cells right, especially when I have a structured grid volume as input.

Such input comes with some typical raw volume file which consists of, 
lets say, 512x512x128 voxels all of them having some value.

Is it that this value is actually stored in a vtkPoints list that 
contains uniformly distributed points in the volume? And a vtkCell in 
this case gets the same value as the point because it contains only this 
single point in its center? ( with value I mean what you get from 
GetComponent(id,c) )

So if I had some arbitrary (non-structured) input, a cell's value would 
be the average of all points lying inside the cell and changing the cell 
layout, i.e. making all cells bigger would accordingly change the 
cell-point relationship and thus the cells value?


Best regards,
Christian

All,

I am pleased to announce that ParaView3 now has GPU based volume rendering
from VTKEdge. Its currently in CVS and should be able to make into 3.8
release.
Currently it does not work in tile display mode but we are hoping to fix it
in near future. Any bug reports are welcome.

Attached is the screen shot.

Message-ID: <c108b3f1002260928k2c8f5b4r2b2252df0b23309@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I am vishwa and am a new member of this mailing list. I have been using
paraview to visualize the cfd results run using openfoam.

I wanted to compile paraview on the high performance cluster so that i can
use the pvserver to see the data sets easily than transferring those to my
local machine.

i installed qt 4.3.5 in my local directory and i also installed cmake in my
local directory. i ran ccmake and then make, followed by make install.

I didnt get any error. however, if i run paraview, i see the main kitware
screen and then it crashes saying segmentation fault. I looked up online and
some people have suggested that using set unlimit stacksize takes care of
the problem. i did that and the result is the same.

i also tried to run the pvserver using this
mpirun --machinefile ${PBS_NODEFILE} -np 4 pvserver
--use-offscreen-rendering --server-port=1111 >log1

for which i get the error
home/vishwa/vishwa/OpenFOAM/ThirdParty-1.6.x/paraview-3.6.1/bin/pvserver-real:
error while loading shared libraries: libGLU.so.1: cannot open shared object
file: No such file or directory

Can anybody help me fix this problem

Regards,
Vishwa

Message-ID: <58623.94.192.82.186.1267209531.squirrel@webmail.bris.ac.uk>

Hi all
I recently began using the superquadric tensor plugin to visualise an
array of stress tensors. I was wondering if there was a way of using the
colour of these glyphs to show whether the eigen values are positive or
negative (stress in compression or tension)? I was also wondering if it
was possible to hide some of the larger glyphs that block out others?
Thanks
Jacob

Hi Utkarsh,

I hadn't heard back from you in a couple weeks & I saw you asking about 
usability improvements, I think saving camera configuration as in the 
patch I sent in with this thread is a good one :)I'm hoping not to let 
this slip through the cracks. What can I do to make this happen 
(assuming you still like the idea) ?

Thanks

Hi Burlen,

The functionality is indeed great. The only hesitation I have is with
burdening server manager code with another serialization code. My
comments are inlined.

>> One substantial difference is that connection id is central in the state
>> implementation. however not only is it not needed for configuration but it
>> cannot be used with configuration. So for configuration the lack of a
>> connection id is a central feature.

Not necessarily true. If you look at vtkSMProxy. It has a method
LoadState() which simply takes in the XMLElement to simply load the
given state on the proxy. If you look at  vtkSMDeserializer (the base
class for state loaders), by providing a right locator to locate the
proxy that the state XML is asking for, the connection id doesn't even
come in the picture. Further more, you can easily provide a totally
separate state loader class for the configuration without having to
add any thing to the properties, proxies

>> Another distinction is that the state of domains aren't needed by
>> configuration.

Honestly domains should not be saved in the normal state as well,
since we never load them back.

But I agree with you that your configuration files are much easier to
edit and read. An alternative solution would be keep that code
isolated i.e. we don't really need to add the Save/Load methods to
vtkSMProxy, vtkSMProperty etc. for the configuration, you can always
simply get/set the property values in your serializer/loader classes.
What do you think?

Hi Utkarsh,

Just to summarize our off list conversation in case any one else is 
following this thread:

We'll not use my new serialization code but rather the current public 
methods  vtkSMProxy::LoadSate/SaveState . We'll add an additional 
optional argument to the method signatures so that the properties to be 
saved or loaded can be filtered (eg filter camera related properties in 
vtkSMRenderViewProxy when saving camera configuration).

I'll send the fix as soon as I can.

Thanks again
Burlen

Burlen,

Further thinking about this, I think filtering the DOM before saving
out the configuration (rather than changing SaveState() signature to
take optional list of properties) maybe even better, since that will
allow you to clean domains from the DOM as well.

All,

I am pleased to announce that ParaView3 now has GPU based volume rendering  from VTKEdge. Its currently in CVS and should be able to make into 3.8 release.
Currently it does not work in tile display mode but we are hoping to fix it in near future. Any bug reports are welcome.

Attached is the screen shot.

OK. But when you said:

They never get loaded back, so their presence won't have a negative 
effect. Besides, if they're not used then there's no reason to have them 
in the state machinery at all. If that's the case we shouldn't let them 
influence the design of a new feature. Perhaps domains should just be 
eliminated from state.

Although practically speaking generating the full dom and cleaning won't 
have a noticeable impact on performance for configuration since they are 
small sets of properties, it just it feels iky. But if that's what you 
want I'm game :)

Subject: [Paraview] Name query from multi-block data in Python
Message-ID: <4B88F4F7.8020607@yahoo.de>

Hi,

I use python to extract blocks of a multi-block dataset. In both 3.6.2
and 3.7-dev I can do:

http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/Extracting_Multiple_Blocks

However it was discussed it will be easier in 3.8?
IS there an opportunity to query for names in an multiblock-dataset with
deepth > 1? The link below works e.g. for Ensight Reader inputs since it
is of deepth 1 but not for mutliblock data with larger deepth.

Thanks Basti

Subject: [Paraview] How to color by Cell Data
Message-ID: <99EDF238-1A5F-4944-B4CB-E8A0C05AF6FD@bluequartz.net>

I have a triangle surface mesh that contains Cell based RGB attribute  
array. I would like to color by that array, ie, not using a Lookup  
table or interpolation. When I load my data set the cell data is  
listed, but in the "color by" drop down list the scalar array is not  
listed as a choice.

   On a "whim" I then ran the "Cell Data to Point Data" filter on the  
data. At that point I was able to select the scalar array to "Color  
By" and the surface mesh now has the correct colors.

   I know if I were to code this up in straight VTk I can set the  
rendering to be by Cells:

   vtkPolyDataMapper *cubeMapper = vtkPolyDataMapper::New();
   cubeMapper->SetInput(filter->GetOutput());
   cubeMapper->SetScalarVisibility(1);
   cubeMapper->SetScalarModeToUseCellData();

How do I get the same effect in ParaView?

Thanks

Hi,
I would to visualize the data that is being computed on a hpc by using
pvserver and paraview.

i have come across a many documents saying how to connect and the one what i
thought might be appropriate in my case would to be to run pvserver on the
hpc and then connect to it usind server/client reverse connection from my
desktop..

here is the procedure that i use to connect to the hpc to submit job.

i log in to the head node via ssh john at a.b.c.d

i then submit my job using the the following script via qsub myscript


*#PBS
-lmem=2Gb,nodes=1:ppn=4,cput=24:00:00,walltime=24:00:00

cd $PBS_O_WORKDIR

cat ${PBS_NODEFILE} > node1
mpirun --machinefile ${PBS_NODEFILE} -np 4 pvserver
--use-offscreen-rendering -\
-server-port=11111 >log1*

in the node1 file, i get say node083 (and it is repeated 4 times)

I am not sure how to connect to this node say by running paraview from my
laptop to visualize that.

Any help would be greatly appreciated..

Currently you are not launching the server in reverse connection mode.  To launch the server in reverse connection mode, you need to give it the arguments -rc (or --reverse-connection) and --client-host=laptop.hostname.com.  When given these arguments, the server will immediately try to make a connection to laptop.hostname.com.  Thus, you first need to have your client running and waiting for the server to connect.  After getting things set up, you should eventually try to set up your client to automatically start the server with an ssh call and then wait for the server to connect back.

Subject: [Paraview] Cells and Points in a Structured Grid Volume
In-Reply-To: <4B87EC8B.4080406@rwth-aachen.de>
Message-ID: <C7AEB630.184B6%kmorel@sandia.gov>

In a 3D structured grid, there is the concept of points and cells and VTK does in fact differentiate the two.  In particular, 8 points make up a hexahedral-shaped voxel cell.  As is dictated by the topology, there is one fewer cell than points in each dimension.  For example, if the grid has 512x512x128 points, it will have 511x511x127 cells.

The raw image reader simply assumes you want to load the data as point data and creates the grid accordingly.  I don't think there is any way to make it load the data as cells.  I can think of three ways to handle this.


 1.  Close your eyes, take a deep breath, and find the inner peace to simply let ParaView/VTK treat the data as point data.  I cannot think of any operation on cell data that can not be done on point data.  You just have to realize that ParaView will also let you do some operations that may not be appropriate for cell data (particularly those that interpolate the values in the cells).
 2.  Make a filter that converts the structured grid that has point data to one that has cell data.  It would simply create a new topology on the output with one more point in every dimension and then shallow copy the data as cell data.  It should not be too hard to implement.  No, I am not volunteering.
 3.  Make a new reader that reads the data as cell data as it should.

I hope that helps.

-Ken

Hello!

I am studying the Threshold Filter to dive more into the mechanics of
filtering and I just want to make sure I got the meaning of points and
cells right, especially when I have a structured grid volume as input.

Such input comes with some typical raw volume file which consists of,
lets say, 512x512x128 voxels all of them having some value.

Is it that this value is actually stored in a vtkPoints list that
contains uniformly distributed points in the volume? And a vtkCell in
this case gets the same value as the point because it contains only this
single point in its center? ( with value I mean what you get from
GetComponent(id,c) )

So if I had some arbitrary (non-structured) input, a cell's value would
be the average of all points lying inside the cell and changing the cell
layout, i.e. making all cells bigger would accordingly change the
cell-point relationship and thus the cells value?


Best regards,
Christian

Hi,
Thanks for the reply..I did look at the wiki and tried the following..

I set up a server/client reverse connection and trired to connect.. but i
coudn't.. this was the command that i gave for the server.. olivegarden is
the hostname of my laptop.

ssh -i /home/dagarshali/.ssh/id_rsa vishwa at hpc4.iastate.edu node083 pvserver
--reverse-connection --server-port=11111 --client-host=olivegarden

here node083 is the node where the pvserver was launched...

so wasn't sure how to give that info in this command.. or am i doing
something wrong.. when you say that start the cient, am i just creating a
server/client and connect in manual mode..?

Regards,
Vishwa

Also be aware that there is a bug in ParaView, where if the server 
startup command doesn't return for some reason, ssh turns into an orphan 
process and will not relinquish the ports it used, preventing any 
further use of those ports.

http://www.paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=10283

I did submit a patch to fix it but it has yet to be applied.

Your command isn't quite right, specifically how you are trying to 
specify the compute node.

Take a look at the section here,
http://paraview.org/Wiki/Reverse_connection_and_port_forwarding#Reverse_Connection_Over_an_ssh_Tunnel

It's a little closer to your situation.

Thankyou all for responding again..:)

I tried to compile paraview and to only hit a wall after wall as I have to
install it to my local folder due to not having administrator privileges..

so i downloaded the binaries last night and checked that it worked..

Today to  my surprise, when i try to open paraview in the hpc headnode,
where i downloaded the binaries, it gives the following error..

[vishwa at hpc4 ~]$ paraview
> ERROR: In
> /home/kitware/ParaView-3.6/ParaView3/VTK/Rendering/vtkXOpenGLRenderWindow.cxx,
> line 632
> vtkXOpenGLRenderWindow (0x143bb10): Cannot create GLX context.  Aborting.
>

and i dont' have /home/kitware etc...directory...so i dont understand what
is happening..

I made sure that i included the path of the bin and lib in the newly
downloaded binary..

Any suggestions?

Regards,
vishwa

Apparently your cluster doesn't have X11 server started. The error 
message reports this path because __FILE__ cpp macro is used.

Question: Why is it a problem to install and run ParaView from your home 
folder? It should be OK.

The problem is that it keeps complaining about not having many library
files..I tried and installed them..now, when i compiled, it didnt' give an
error..but when opened it gave segmentation fault.. i read somewhere online
that u need to use unlimit stacksize, which I did and still doesnt work.

i had used -mpi opition and also to use mesa ..

hit a wall again..

Regards,
vishwa

It's really not info info for me to give you any specific advise. But my 
best guess is that at run time the wrong open gl liibraries are being 
loaded. That will crash PV. You want the mesa libraries from your local 
mesa build to be loaded, you have to prepend its path to LD_LIBRARY_PATH 
environment var. Also double check in ccmake, that all of the opengl 
libs come from your mesa build.

I tried to install mesa locally also.. at which point it kept saying it
needs libdrm, and when i tried to install libdrm, it kept complaining that
it coudn't find pthreads-stubs.pc..so i ended up using the system mesa

Vishwa

If I were you I'd get your local build of mesa going and use that 
(simply to remove all ambiguity).

Were you using autotools method (eg ./configure && make) or the canned 
configurations (eg make linux)?

In my experience, and I have heard of others having issues too, the 
autotools method fails. So if you were using the autotools method, then 
I suggest you try the canned configs. Do a fresh untar of mesa, cd in 
and try "make linux" (or choose one of the other configs if you like). 

When you rebuild PV be sure about the configuration in ccmake and set 
LD_LIBRARY_PATH as I mentioned before.

You can't with 3.6.2. It's only possible with 3.8.

That's weird, your cell array should have been listed in the Color By
menu. Is it possible to share the data or a small sample to reproduce
the issue?

Hi,
I noted this problem a few days ago.
A *really* simple example:
- Add a SphereSource
- Connect to a "Generate Ids" filter
- Update: The information panel shows a 'Ids' array for points and for
cells, but
the "Color by" doesn't give the choice of cell array.

Subject: [Paraview] Cells and Points in a Structured Grid Volume
In-Reply-To: <C7AEB630.184B6%kmorel@sandia.gov>

Message-ID: <4B8A487C.7050109@rwth-aachen.de>

Thank you very much. Now things have become a little clearer. Anyway 
there are a few things which I do not yet understand.

I see now from the source of the Threshold plugin that the data to be 
processed is actually obtained in three different ways:

vtkPointData *pd=input->GetPointData(), *outPD=output->GetPointData();
vtkCellData *cd=input->GetCellData(), *outCD=output->GetCellData();

vtkDataArray *inScalars = this->GetInputArrayToProcess(0,inputVector); 
//inputVector is the input information vector


where the latter seems to be the array containing the actual volume 
data. The decision if a cell or point goes through the thresholding 
criteria is made a little later:

keepCell = this->EvaluateComponents( inScalars, ptId );
or
keepCell = this->EvaluateComponents( inScalars, cellId );


This raises two questions:

1) are the ptId and cellId disjunct?
2) if yes, does that mean that the InputArray contains point AND cell 
data? This clearly would require additional memory which is bad if you 
are working with big volumes.

Also I see the use of a DataSet which seems to hold all the cells of the 
volume and each cell seems to contain points ( these must be 8, right? ) 
I guess these points store coordinates? At least there is still another 
array containing only IDs. It seems as if there actually is a bunch of 
redundant information stored when I read structured grid, or at least 
when executing the Threshold filter.

This would explain why the memory usage skyrockets when manipulating our 
700MB (small version!) volume.

I don't want to complain here about anything, that memory issue is 
another story. More important to me is that I understand the structure 
of this.


Best regards,
Christian

Hmm, I tried it without success:

yieds to:

Hi,
I noted this problem a few days ago.
A *really* simple example:
- Add a SphereSource
- Connect to a "Generate Ids" filter
- Update: The information panel shows a 'Ids' array for points and for cells, but
the "Color by" doesn't give the choice of cell array.

Jerome
-----------------

I cannot reproduce the problem. The following code works exactly as expected and enables the coloring by POINT_DATA or CELL_DATA

sph1 = Sphere()
genid1 = GenerateIds(Input=sph1)
rep1 = Show(genid1)
rep1.ColorArrayName = 'Ids'
rep1.ColorAttributeType = 'CELL_DATA'

Hi,

I confirm the problem: even with your script, CELL_DATA are not enabled.
They don't appear in the "Color by" combo box, but the cell Ids are present
in the Information panel. It works as expected when I try with POINT_DATA.

I just had a doubt: Qt has been updated to 4.6 recently on my computer, and
I don't know if my ParaView is up-to-date according to this...

Let's update, compile, wait and see.

Subject: [Paraview] XDMF: multiple DataItems under Geometry
Message-ID: <4B8A7B46.2000102@renci.org>

Hi All,

I have a Lagrange grid in 3D (e.g. 80 x 80 x 80) in HDF5 format. And my
grid coordinates are arranged into 3 vectors, i.e. x, y, z. So far, I
can only build the XDMF geometry successfully as

<Geometry GeometryType="XYZ">
<DataItem NumberType="Float" Precision="4" Dimensions="512000 3"
Format="HDF">xxx.h5:/Event/xyz</DataItem>
</Geometry>

by using XDMF API in C

XdmfValuesHDF* x_ValuesHDF;
XdmfString x_String = x_ValuesHDF->DataItemFromHDF(h5_string);
x_Geometry->SetDataXml(x_String);

However in this case ("XYZ"), I need one for loop to construct the
512000x3 array (xyz) from the three vectors: x, y, z. This is quite
costly. If I want to build the geometry type as "X_Y_Z", e.g.

<Geometry GeometryType="X_Y_Z">
<DataItem NumberType="Float" Precision="4" Dimensions="3 512000"
Format="HDF">xxx.h5:/Event/x_y_z</DataItem>
</Geometry>

ParaView only recognizes the x component while assign all y's and z's to
ZERO. Is there a bug in XDMF API or ParaView? Ideally, I would like to
build sth. like

<Geometry GeometryType="X_Y_Z">
<DataItem NumberType="Float" Precision="4" Dimensions="80 80 80"
Format="HDF">xxx.h5:/Event/x</DataItem>
<DataItem NumberType="Float" Precision="4" Dimensions="80 80 80"
Format="HDF">xxx.h5:/Event/y</DataItem>
<DataItem NumberType="Float" Precision="4" Dimensions="80 80 80"
Format="HDF">xxx.h5:/Event/z</DataItem>
</Geometry>

*How can I insert multiple XdmfDataItem's in XdmfGeometry class?* I've tried

XdmfDataItem* x_DataItem;
x_DataItem = new XdmfDataItem;
x_Geometry->Insert(x_DataItem);
x_DataItem->SetDataXml(x_String_for_x_vector);

x_DataItem = new XdmfDataItem;
x_Geometry->Insert(x_DataItem);
x_DataItem->SetDataXml(x_String_for_y_vector);

x_DataItem = new XdmfDataItem;
x_Geometry->Insert(x_DataItem);
x_DataItem->SetDataXml(x_String_for_z_vector);

This produces

<Geometry GeometryType="X_Y_Z">
<DataItem ...>
<DataItem NumberType="Float" Precision="4" Dimensions="80 80 80"
Format="HDF">xxx.h5:/Event/x</DataItem>
</DataItem>
<DataItem ...>
<DataItem NumberType="Float" Precision="4" Dimensions="80 80 80"
Format="HDF">xxx.h5:/Event/y</DataItem>
</DataItem>
<DataItem ...>
<DataItem NumberType="Float" Precision="4" Dimensions="80 80 80"
Format="HDF">xxx.h5:/Event/z</DataItem>
</DataItem>
</Geometry>

which causes ParaView to crash. I have also tried

XdmfDataItem* x_DataItem;
x_DataItem = new XdmfDataItem;
x_Geometry->Insert(x_DataItem);
x_DataItem->SetName("x");
x_DataItem->Set("NumberType", "Float");
x_DataItem->Set("Precision", "4");
x_DataItem->SetShape(3, [80 80 80]);
x_DataItem->SetFormat(XDMF_FORMAT_HDF);
x_DataItem->SetHeavyDataSetName(h5_string_for_x);
...
//y and z portions are similar to that of x.

This produces

<Geometry GeometryType="X_Y_Z">
<DataItem NumberType="Float" Precision="4" Dimensions="3"
Format="HDF">xxx.h5:/Event/x</DataItem>
<DataItem NumberType="Float" Precision="4" Dimensions="3"
Format="HDF">xxx.h5:/Event/y</DataItem>
<DataItem NumberType="Float" Precision="4" Dimensions="3"
Format="HDF">xxx.h5:/Event/z</DataItem>
</Geometry>

This is the closest to what I want. Unfortunately the data shape is
wrong. No matter what I send in SetShape(), the produced XMF has
Dimensions="3". Is there a BUG in XDMF API?

Please help. Thanks a lot.

Best,
xunlei

   Maybe it is Qt versions or ParaView versions? I am using Qt 4.6.1  
compiled for Cocoa on OS X 10.5.8 Intel. I am using ParaView from <url  
= git://github.com/Kitware/ParaView.git> which was last updated about  
a week ago. When I get to the office on Monday I can try the same with  
ParaView 3.6.2 and see if the problem persists.

   As far as Data, I _could_ share it, but like Jerome stated, you can  
reproduce it with a simple sphere source, then "Generate Normals". The  
complete source code can be found here:

That is weird. I am on Mac with Qt 4.6.0, Cocoa and the latest CVS
ParaView and I see both point "Ids" and cell "Ids" in the Color By
menu. I'll test it out with my linux box at work tomorrow.

Is ParaView still on CVS or is that git location "official" to use? If  
the git location isn't really official, then maybe I should switch  
back to CVS?

Well, I just updated my worktree with the latest CVS. The problem remains,
both in debug and release. Note that Yum (package manager of Fedora)
installs qt-4.6.2.

I will trace the code tomorrow monday.

Hi,
when i try to compile mesa under redhat x-86-64 using make linux-x86-64, i
get linker errors among several .o files in src/mesa/drivers/x11 (fakeglx.o,
glxapi.o etc..) the output being multiple definitions of gnu_dev_major,
strings files etc..)

Any idea as to why this is happening..?

Regards,
Vishwa
